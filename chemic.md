# [[chemic]]

 Chemistry is a wide Field; therefore it is broken up into 
- [Chemical Elements](chemic/Chemical_Element.md) 
- [[chemic/Chemical_Substance/Chemical_Compound|Chemical_Compound]] 
	- [organic Chemistry](chemic/organic.md) and 
	- [inOrganic Chemistry](chemic/inOrganic.md)

## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Chemistry** is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a physical science under natural sciences that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.
>
> In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).
