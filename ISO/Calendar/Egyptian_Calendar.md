> The ancient Egyptian calendar – a civil calendar – was a solar calendar with a 365-day year. 
> The year consisted of three seasons of 120 days each, 
> plus an intercalary month of five epagomenal days treated as outside of the year proper. 
> 
> Each season was divided into four months of 30 days. 
> These twelve months were initially numbered within each season 
> but came to also be known by the names of their principal festivals. 
> 
> Each month was divided into three 10-day periods known as decans or decades. 
> It has been suggested that during the Nineteenth Dynasty and the Twentieth Dynasty 
> the last two days of each decan were usually treated as a kind of weekend for the royal craftsmen, 
> with royal artisans free from work.
>
> Because this calendrical year was nearly a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year, 
> the Egyptian calendar lost about one day every four years relative to the Julian calendar. 
> It is therefore sometimes referred to as the wandering year (Latin: annus vagus), 
> as its months rotated about one day through the solar year every four years. 
> 
> Ptolemy III's Canopus Decree attempted to correct this 
> through the introduction of a sixth epagomenal day every four years 
> but the proposal was resisted by the Egyptian priests and people and abandoned 
> until the decree by Augustus in 25 BC that established the Alexandrian or Coptic calendar. 
> 
> The introduction of a leap day to the Egyptian calendar made it equivalent to the Julian calendar, 
> although (like the latter) it continues to diverge from the Gregorian calendar 
> at the turn of most centuries.
>
> This civil calendar ran concurrently with an Egyptian lunar calendar 
> which was used for some religious rituals and festivals. 
> 
> Some Egyptologists have described it as lunisolar, 
> with an intercalary month supposedly added every two or three years 
> to maintain its consistency with the solar year, 
> but no evidence of such intercalation before the 4th century BC has yet been discovered.
