> The Julian calendar is a solar calendar of 365 days in every year 
> with an additional leap day every fourth year (without exception). 
> 
> The Julian calendar is still used as a religious calendar in parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church 
> and in parts of Oriental Orthodoxy as well as by the Amazigh people (also known as the Berbers). 
> For a quick calculation, between 1901 and 2099 
> the much more common Gregorian date equals the Julian date plus 13 days.
>
> The Julian calendar was proposed in 46 BC by (and takes its name from) Julius Caesar, 
> as a reform of the earlier Roman calendar, which was largely a lunisolar one. 
> It took effect on 1 January 45 BC, by his edict.  
> 
> Caesar's calendar became the predominant calendar in the Roman Empire 
> and subsequently most of the Western world for more than 1,600 years, 
> until 1582 when Pope Gregory XIII promulgated a revised calendar. 
> Ancient Romans typically designated years by the names of ruling consuls; 
> the Anno Domini system of numbering years was not devised until 525, 
> and became widespread in Europe in the eighth century.
>
> The Julian calendar has two types of years: a normal year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. 
> They follow a simple cycle of three normal years and one leap year, 
> giving an average year that is 365.25 days long. 
> That is more than the actual solar year value of approximately 365.2422 days 
> (the current value, which varies), which means the Julian calendar gains one day every 129 years. 
> In other words, the Julian calendar gains 3.1 days every 400 years. 
>
> Gregory's calendar reform modified the Julian rule by eliminating occasional leap days, 
> to reduce the average length of the calendar year from 365.25 days to 365.2425 days 
> and thus almost eliminated the Julian calendar's drift against the solar year: 
> the Gregorian calendar gains just 0.1 day over 400 years. 
> 
> For any given event during the years from 1901 through 2099, 
> its date according to the Julian calendar is 13 days behind its corresponding Gregorian date 
> (for instance Julian 1 January falls on Gregorian 14 January). 
> 
> Most Catholic countries adopted the new calendar immediately; 
> Protestant countries did so slowly in the course of the following two centuries or so; 
> most Orthodox countries retain the Julian calendar for religious purposes 
> but adopted the Gregorian as their civil calendar in the early part of the twentieth century.
