## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Time zone** is an area which observes a uniform standard time 
> for legal, commercial and social purposes. 
> 
> Time zones tend to follow the boundaries between countries and their subdivisions 
> instead of strictly following longitude, 
> because it is convenient for areas in frequent communication 
> to keep the same time and avoid Conversions.
>
> Each time zone is defined by a standard offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The offsets range from UTCâˆ’12:00 to UTC+14:00, and are usually a whole number of hours, but a few zones are offset by an additional 30 or 45 minutes, such as in India and Nepal. Some areas in a time zone may use a different offset for part of the year, typically one hour ahead during spring and summer, a practice known as daylight saving time (DST).
