> **Halloween**, or Hallowe'en (also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve), 
> is a celebration observed in many countries  on 31 October, 
> the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. 
> 
> It is at the beginning of the observance of Allhallowtide, 
> the time in the Christian liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, 
> including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed. 
> In popular culture, Halloween has become a celebration of horror 
> and is associated with the macabre and the supernatural.
>
> One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, 
> particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. 
> 
> Some theories go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallows' Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics say Halloween began independently as a Christian holiday, being the vigil  of All Hallows' Day. Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then through American influence various Halloween customs spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.
>
> Popular activities during Halloween include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling frightening stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some Christians practice the observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.
