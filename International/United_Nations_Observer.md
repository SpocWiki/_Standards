## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The United Nations General Assembly has granted observer status 
> to international organizations, entities, and non-member states, 
> to enable them to participate in the work of the United Nations General Assembly, 
> though with limitations. 
> 
> The General Assembly determines the privileges it will grant to each observer, beyond those 
> laid down in a 1986 Conference on treaties between states and international organizations. 
> 
> Exceptionally, the European Union (EU) was in 2011 granted the right to speak in debates, 
> to submit proposals and amendments, the right of reply, 
> to raise points of order and to circulate documents, etc. 
> 
> As of May 2011, the EU is the only international organization to hold these enhanced rights, 
> which has been likened to the rights of full membership, short of the right to vote.
>
> Observer status may be granted by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. 
> The status of a permanent observer is based purely on practice of the General Assembly, 
> and there are no provisions for it in the United Nations Charter. 
> The practice is to distinguish between state and non-state observers. 
> Non-member states are members of one or more specialized agencies, 
> and can apply for permanent observer state status. 
> Non-state observers are the international organizations and other entities.
