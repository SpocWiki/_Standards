> Isaac Merritt Singer (October 27, 1811 – July 23, 1875) 
> was an American inventor, actor, and businessman. 
> 
> He made important improvements in the design of the sewing machine 
> and was the founder of what became one of the first American multi-national businesses, 
> the [[Singer,Isaac/Singer_Sewing_Machine_Company|Singer_Sewing_Machine_Company]].
>
> Many others, including Walter Hunt and Elias Howe, 
> had patented sewing machines before Singer, 
> but his success was based on the practicality of his machine, 
> the ease with which it could be adapted to home use 
> and its availability on an installments payment basis.
>
> Singer died in 1875, dividing his $13 million fortune unequally 
> among 20 of his living children by his wives and various mistresses, 
> although one son, who had supported his mother in her divorce case against Singer, 
> received only $500. 
> 
> Altogether, he fathered 26 children by five different women.
