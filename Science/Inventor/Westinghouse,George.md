> George Westinghouse Jr. (October 6, 1846 – March 12, 1914) was a prolific American inventor, 
> engineer, and entrepreneurial industrialist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
> 
> He is best known for his creation of the railway air brake 
> and for being a pioneer in the development and use of alternating current (AC) electrical power distribution. During his career, he received 360 patents for his inventions and established 61 companies, many of which still exist today.
>
> His invention of a train braking system using compressed air revolutionized the railroad industry around the world. He founded the Westinghouse Air Brake Company in 1869. He and his engineers also developed track-switching and signaling systems, which lead to the founding of the company Union Switch & Signal in 1881. 
>
> In the early 1880s, he developed inventions for the safe production, transmission, and use of natural gas. This sparked the creation of a whole new energy industry.
>
> During this same period, Westinghouse recognized 
> the potential of using alternating current (AC) for electric power distribution. 
> In 1886, he founded the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. 
> Westinghouse's electric business directly competed with Thomas Edison's, 
> who was promoting direct current (DC) electricity. 
> 
> Westinghouse Electric won the contract to showcase its AC system to illuminate the "White City" 
> at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. 
> The company went on to install the world's first large-scale, AC power generation plant 
> at Niagara Falls, New York, which opened in August 1895. 
>
> Ironically, among many other honors, Westinghouse received the 1911 Edison Medal 
> of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers "for meritorious achievement in connection with the development of the alternating current system".
