> **Ernő Rubik** (Hungarian: [ˈrubik ˈɛrnøː]; born 13 July 1944) 
> is a Hungarian architect and inventor, 
> widely known for creating the Rubik's Cube (1974), Rubik's Magic, and Rubik's Snake.
>
> While Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik's Cube and his other puzzles, 
> much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in education. 
> 
> Rubik is involved with several organizations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, 
> the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation, 
> all of which aim to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.
>
> Rubik studied sculpture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design in Budapest 
> and architecture at the Technical University, likewise located in Budapest. 
> 
> While a professor of design at the academy, 
> he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. 
> 
> One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; 
> it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. 
> 
> It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, 
> Hungary's state trading company, he began marketing it. 
> 
> By 1980, Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, 
> and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, 
> were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. 
> 
> Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. 
> Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; 
> among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic.
