> The Wright brothers, 
> - Orville Wright (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and 
> - Wilbur Wright (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), 
> were American aviation pioneers generally credited with 
> inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. 
> 
> They made the first controlled, sustained flight of an engine-powered, 
> heavier-than-air aircraft with the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, 
> four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. 
> 
> In 1904 the Wright brothers developed the Wright Flyer II, 
> which made longer-duration flights including the first circle, 
> followed in 1905 by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III.
>
> The brothers' breakthrough invention was their creation of a three-axis control system, 
> which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. 
> 
> Their system of aircraft controls made fixed-wing powered flight possible 
> and remains standard on airplanes of all kinds. 
> 
> Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, 
> but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces. 
> 
> From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on 
> developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving "the flying problem". 
> 
> This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time 
> who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines. 
> 
> Using a small home-built wind tunnel, 
> the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, 
> enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.
>
> The brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success 
> by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with 
> printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. 
> 
> Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced 
> their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine 
> could be controlled and balanced with practice. 
> 
> This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists 
> and involved in the bicycle business in various ways. 
> From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, 
> the brothers conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. 
> 
> Their shop mechanic Charles Taylor became an important part of the team, 
> building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.
>
> The Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane 
> has been subject to numerous counter-claims. 
> 
> Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. 
> Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, 
> argues that the Wrights were excellent self-taught engineers 
> who could run a small company well, 
> but did not have the business skills or temperament necessary 
> to dominate the rapidly growing aviation industry at the time.
