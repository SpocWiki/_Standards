> Josephine Cochran (later Cochrane; née Garis; March 8, 1839 – August 3, 1913) 
> was an American inventor who invented the first successful hand-powered dishwasher, 
> which she designed and then constructed with the assistance of mechanic George Butters, 
> who became one of her first employees.
>
> Once her patent issued on 28 December 1886, she founded Garis-Cochrane Manufacturing Company 
> to manufacture her machines. 
> 
> Cochrane showed her new machine at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 
> where nine Garis-Cochran washers were installed in the restaurants and pavilions of the fair 
> and was met with interest from restaurants and hotels, where hot water access was not an issue. 
> She won the prize for "best mechanical construction, durability and adaptation to its line of work" 
> at the Fair. 
> 
> Garis-Cochran Manufacturing Company, which built dishwashers, 
> grew through a focus on hotels and other commercial customers 
> and was renamed as Cochran's Crescent Washing Machine Company in 1897.
>
> Cochran's Crescent Washing Machine Company became part of KitchenAid through acquisition 
> by Hobart Manufacturing Company several years after Cochran's death in 1913. 
> 
> Cochran was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006 
> for patent 355,139 issued on December 28, 1886, for her invention of the dishwasher.
