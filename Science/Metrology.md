> **Metrology** is the scientific study of measurement. 
> 
> It establishes a common understanding of units, crucial in linking human activities. 
> Modern metrology has its roots in the French Revolution's political motivation to standardise units in France 
> when a length standard taken from a natural source was proposed. 
> 
> This led to the creation of the decimal-based metric system in 1795, 
> establishing a set of standards for other types of measurements. 
> Several other countries adopted the metric system between 1795 and 1875; 
> to ensure conformity between the countries, the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was established by the Metre Convention. 
> This has evolved into the International System of Units (SI) as a result of a resolution 
> at the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1960.
>
> Metrology is divided into three basic overlapping activities: 
> - The definition of units of measurement
> - The realisation of these units of measurement in practice
> - Traceability—linking measurements made in practice to the reference standards
> These overlapping activities are used in varying degrees by the three basic sub-fields of metrology: 
> - Scientific or fundamental metrology, concerned with the establishment of units of measurement
> - Applied, technical or industrial metrology—the application of measurement to manufacturing and other processes in society
> - Legal metrology, covering the regulation and statutory requirements for measuring instruments and methods of measurement
>
> In each country, a national measurement system (NMS) exists 
> as a network of laboratories, calibration facilities and accreditation bodies 
> which implement and maintain its metrology infrastructure. 
> 
> The NMS affects how measurements are made in a country and their recognition by the international community, 
> which has a wide-ranging impact in its society (including economics, energy, environment, health, manufacturing, industry and consumer confidence). 
> 
> The effects of metrology on trade and economy are some of the easiest-observed societal impacts. 
> To facilitate fair trade, there must be an agreed-upon system of measurement.
