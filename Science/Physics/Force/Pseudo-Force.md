# [[Pseudo-Force]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A fictitious force, also known as an inertial force or pseudo-force, 
> is a force that appears to act on an object 
> when its motion is described or experienced from a non-inertial frame of reference. 
> 
> Unlike real forces, which result from physical interactions between objects, 
> fictitious forces occur due to the acceleration of the observerâ€™s frame of reference 
> rather than any actual force acting on a body. 
> 
> These forces are necessary for describing motion correctly within an accelerating frame, 
> ensuring that Newton's second law of motion remains applicable.
>
> Common examples of fictitious forces include 
> - the centrifugal force, which appears to push objects outward in a rotating system; 
> - the Coriolis force, which affects moving objects in a rotating frame such as the Earth; and 
> - the Euler force, which arises when a rotating system changes its angular velocity. 
> 
> While these forces are not real in the sense of being caused by physical interactions, 
> they are essential for accurately analyzing motion within accelerating reference frames, 
> particularly in disciplines such as classical mechanics, meteorology, and astrophysics.
>
> Fictitious forces play a crucial role in understanding everyday phenomena, 
> such as weather patterns influenced by the Coriolis effect 
> and the perceived weightlessness experienced by astronauts in free-fall orbits. 
> They are also fundamental in engineering applications, including navigation systems and rotating machinery.
>
> According to General relativity theory we perceive gravitational force 
> when spacetime is bending near heavy objects, so even this might be called a fictitious force.
