## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, a **Conservation law** states that 
> a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change 
> as the system evolves over time. 
> 
> Exact conservation laws include conservation of mass-energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge. 
> There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as 
> mass, parity, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc.  
> These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.
>
> A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a continuity equation, 
> a partial differential equation which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity 
> and the "transport" of that quantity. 
> 
> It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume 
> can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.
>
> From [[Noether's_Theorem]], every differentiable symmetry leads to a local conservation law. 
> Other conserved quantities can exist as well.
