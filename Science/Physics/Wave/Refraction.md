> In physics, **Refraction** is the redirection of a wave 
> as it passes from one medium to another. 
> 
> The redirection can be caused by the wave's change in speed 
> or by a change in the medium. 
> 
> Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, 
> but other waves such as sound waves and water waves also experience refraction. 
> 
> How much a wave is refracted is determined by the change in wave speed 
> and the initial direction of wave propagation relative to the direction of change in speed.
>
> Optical prisms and lenses use refraction to redirect light, as does the human eye. 
> The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength of light, 
> and thus the angle of the refraction also varies correspondingly. 
> 
> This is called dispersion and allows prisms  and raindrops in rainbows 
> to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors.
