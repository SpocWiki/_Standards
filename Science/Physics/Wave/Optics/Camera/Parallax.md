> **Parallax** is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object 
> viewed along two different lines of sight 
> and is measured by the angle or half-angle of inclination between those two lines. 
> 
> Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects, 
> so parallax can be used to determine distances.
>
> To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, 
> astronomers use the principle of parallax. 
> 
> Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination 
> between two sight-lines to the star, 
> as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit. 
> 
> These distances form the lowest rung of what is called "the cosmic distance ladder", 
> the first in a succession of methods 
> by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, 
> serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy 
> forming the higher rungs of the ladder.
>
> Because parallax is weak if the triangle formed with an object under observation 
> and two observation points has an angle much greater than 90°, 
> the use of parallax for distance measurements 
> is usually restricted to objects that are directly "faced" by the baseline 
> (the line between two observation points) of the formed triangles.
>
> Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, 
> and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. 
> 
> Many animals, along with humans, have two eyes with overlapping visual fields 
> that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is known as stereopsis. 
> 
> In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, 
> and there is a device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find the range, 
> and in some variations also altitude to a target.
>
> A simple everyday example of parallax 
> can be seen in the dashboards of motor vehicles 
> that use a needle-style mechanical speedometer. 
> 
> When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60, 
> but when viewed from the passenger seat, 
> the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed due to the angle of viewing 
> combined with the displacement of the needle from the plane of the numerical dial.
