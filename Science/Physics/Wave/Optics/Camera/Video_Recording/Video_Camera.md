## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A video camera is an optical instrument that captures videos, 
> as opposed to a movie camera, which records images on film. 
> 
> Video cameras were initially developed for the television industry 
> but have since become widely used for a variety of other purposes.
>
> Video cameras are used primarily in two modes. 
> The first, characteristic of much early broadcasting, is live television, 
> where the camera feeds real time images directly to a screen for immediate observation.  
> 
> A few cameras still serve live television production, but most live connections are for security, 
> military/tactical, and industrial operations where surreptitious or remote viewing is required. 
> 
> In the second mode the images are recorded to a storage device for archiving or further processing; 
> for many years, videotape was the primary format used for this purpose, 
> but was gradually supplanted by optical disc, hard disk, and then flash memory. 
> 
> Recorded video is used in television production, and more often surveillance and monitoring tasks 
> in which unattended recording of a situation is required for later analysis.
