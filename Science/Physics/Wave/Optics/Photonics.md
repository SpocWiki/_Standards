## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Photonics** is a branch of optics that involves the generation, detection, and manipulation of light 
> in the form of photons through emission, transmission, modulation, signal processing, switching, amplification, and sensing. 
> 
> Even though photonics is a commonly used term, 
> there is no widespread agreement on a clear definition of the term 
> or on the difference between photonics and related fields, such as optics. 
>
> Photonics is closely related to quantum optics, 
> which studies the theory behind photonics' engineering applications. 
> Though covering all light's technical applications over the whole spectrum, 
> most photonic applications are in the range of visible and near-infrared light. 
>
> The term photonics developed with the first practical semiconductor light emitters 
> invented in the early 1960s and optical fibers developed in the 1970s.
>
> The field is also supported by professional organizations such as the IEEE Photonics Society, 
> which serves as a conduit for advances in photonics research, engineering, and its applications.
