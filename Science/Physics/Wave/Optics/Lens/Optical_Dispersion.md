> Dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency. 
> Sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used to refer to optics specifically, 
> as opposed to wave propagation in general.  
> A medium having this common property may be termed a dispersive medium.
>
> Although the term is used in the field of optics 
> to describe light and other electromagnetic waves, 
> dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion 
> such as acoustic dispersion in the case of sound and seismic waves, 
> and in gravity waves (ocean waves). 
> 
> Within optics, dispersion is a property of telecommunication signals along transmission lines 
> (such as microwaves in coaxial cable) or the pulses of light in optical fiber.
>
> In optics, one important and familiar consequence of dispersion 
> is the change in the angle of refraction of different colors of light, 
> as seen in the spectrum produced by a dispersive prism and in chromatic aberration of lenses. 
> Design of compound achromatic lenses, in which chromatic aberration is largely cancelled, 
> uses a quantification of a glass's dispersion given by its Abbe number V, 
> where lower Abbe numbers correspond to greater dispersion over the visible spectrum. 
> 
> In some applications such as telecommunications, 
> the absolute phase of a wave is often not important 
> but only the propagation of wave packets or "pulses"; 
> in that case one is interested only in variations of group velocity with frequency, 
> so-called group-velocity dispersion.
>
> All common transmission media also vary in attenuation (normalized to transmission length) 
> as a function of frequency, leading to attenuation distortion; 
> this is not dispersion, although sometimes reflections at closely spaced impedance boundaries 
> (e.g. crimped segments in a cable) can produce signal distortion 
> which further aggravates inconsistent transit time as observed across signal bandwidth.
