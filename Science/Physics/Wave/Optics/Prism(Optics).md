> An optical prism is a transparent optical element 
> with flat, polished surfaces that are designed to refract light. 
> 
> At least one surface must be angled—elements with two parallel surfaces are not prisms. 
> The most familiar type of optical prism is the triangular prism, 
> which has a triangular base and rectangular sides. 
> 
> Not all optical prisms are geometric prisms, and not all geometric prisms would count as an optical prism. Prisms can be made from any material that is transparent to the wavelengths for which they are designed. Typical materials include glass, acrylic and fluorite.
>
> A dispersive prism can be used to break white light up into its constituent spectral colors (the colors of the rainbow) to form a spectrum as described in the following section.  Other types of prisms noted below can be used to reflect light, or to split light into components with different polarizations.
