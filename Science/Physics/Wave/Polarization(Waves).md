> An electromagnetic wave such as light consists of a coupled oscillating electric field and magnetic field that are always perpendicular to each other. Different states of polarization correspond to different relationships between the directions of the fields and the direction of propagation. In linear polarization, the electric and magnetic fields each oscillate in a single direction, perpendicular to one another.  In circular or elliptical polarization, the fields rotate around the beam's direction of travel at a constant rate. The rotation can be either in the right-hand or in the left-hand direction.

> Light or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and incandescent lamps, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called unpolarized light.  Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a polarizer, which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. The most common optical materials do not affect the polarization of light, but some materials—those that exhibit birefringence, dichroism, or optical activity—affect light differently depending on its polarization.  Some of these are used to make polarizing filters.  Light also becomes partially polarized when it reflects at an angle from a surface.

> According to quantum mechanics, electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called photons.  When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their spin.  A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a right hand sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized electromagnetic waves are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand.  Linearly polarized waves consist of photons that are in a superposition of right and left circularly polarized states, with equal amplitude and phases synchronized to give oscillation in a plane.

> Polarization is an important parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as optics, seismology, radio, and microwaves. Especially impacted are technologies such as lasers, wireless and optical fiber telecommunications, and radar.
