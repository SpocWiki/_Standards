> In physics, a surface wave is a mechanical wave 
> that propagates along the interface between differing media.  
> 
> A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, 
> such as ocean waves.  
> 
> Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, 
> at the interface between two fluids with different densities.  
> 
> Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, 
> such as Rayleigh or Love waves.  
> 
> Electromagnetic waves can also propagate as "surface waves" in that 
> they can be guided along with a refractive index gradient 
> or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. 
> 
> In radio transmission, 
> a ground wave is a guided wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth.
