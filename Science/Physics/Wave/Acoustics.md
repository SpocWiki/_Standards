## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Acoustics** is a branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves 
> in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as 
> vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound. 
> 
> A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician 
> while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer. 
> The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society 
> with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.
>
> Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world 
> and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. 
> 
> Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—
> music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. 
> 
> Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound 
> and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or for marking territories.
