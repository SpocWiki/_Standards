## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Noise** is sound, chiefly unwanted, unintentional, or harmful sound 
> considered unpleasant, loud, or disruptive to mental or hearing faculties. 
> 
> From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, 
> as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound. Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. 
>
> Noise may also refer to a random or unintended component of an electronic signal, whose effects may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection. It can also refer to an intentionally produced random signal or spectral noise, such as white noise or pink noise.
>
> In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss. This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting. In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.
