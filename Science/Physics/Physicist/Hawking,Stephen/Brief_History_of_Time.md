> **A Brief History of Time**: From the Big Bang to Black Holes 
> is a book on cosmology by the physicist Stephen Hawking, first published in 1988.
>
> Hawking writes in non-technical terms 
> about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the universe. 
> 
> He talks about basic concepts like space and time, 
> building blocks that make up the universe (such as quarks) 
> and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity).  
> 
> He discusses two theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics 
> that form the foundation of modern physics. 
> 
> Finally, he talks about the search for a unified theory 
> that consistently describes everything in the universe.
>
> The book became a bestseller and has sold more than 25 million copies in 40 languages. 
> It was included on Time's list of the 100 best nonfiction books since the magazine's founding. 
> 
> Errol Morris made a documentary, A Brief History of Time (1991) 
> which combines material from Hawking's book 
> with interviews featuring Hawking, his colleagues, and his family.
>
> An illustrated version was published in 1996. 
> In 2006, Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow published an abridged version, A Briefer History of Time.
