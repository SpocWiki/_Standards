> Werner Karl Heisenberg (German: [ˈvɛʁnɐ ˈhaɪzn̩bɛʁk] ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) 
> was a German theoretical physicist, 
> one of the main pioneers of the theory of quantum mechanics 
> and a principal scientist in the German nuclear program during World War II.
>
> Heisenberg published his Umdeutung paper in 1925, a major reinterpretation of old quantum theory. 
> 
> In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, 
> his matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. 
> He is known for the uncertainty principle, which he published in 1927. 
> 
> He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 "for the creation of quantum mechanics".
>
> Heisenberg also made contributions to the theories of the hydrodynamics of turbulent flows, 
> the atomic nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic rays, and subatomic particles. 
> 
> He introduced the concept of a wave function collapse. 
> He was also instrumental in planning the first West German nuclear reactor in Karlsruhe, 
> together with a research reactor in Munich, in 1957.
>
> Following World War II, 
> Heisenberg was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, 
> which soon thereafter was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Physics. 
> He was director until it was moved to Munich in 1958. 
> He was Director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics from 1960 to 1970.
>
> Heisenberg was also President of the German Research Council, 
> Chairman of the Commission for Atomic Physics, 
> Chairman of the Nuclear Physics Working Group, 
> and President of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.
