> Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata "C. V." Raman ( RAH-muhn; Tamil: சந்திரசேகர வெங்கட ராமன், romanised: Cantiracēkara Veṅkaṭa Rāmaṉ; 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) 
> was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering. 
> 
> Using a spectrograph that he developed, 
> he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, 
> the deflected light changes its wavelength. 
> 
> This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, 
> which they called modified scattering 
> was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. 
> 
> In 1930, Raman received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery 
> and was the first Asian and non-White to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.
>
> Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, Raman was a precocious child, 
> completing his secondary and higher secondary education 
> from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the age of 11 and 13, respectively. 
> 
> He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras 
> with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. 
> 
> His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 
> while he was still a graduate student. 
> 
> The next year he obtained a master's degree. 
> He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. 
> There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), 
> the first research institute in India, which allowed him to carry out independent research 
> and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.
>
> In 1917, he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee 
> at the Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. 
> 
> On his first trip to Europe, seeing the Mediterranean Sea motivated him 
> to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the time, 
> namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect. 
> 
> He founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926. 
> He moved to Bangalore in 1933 
> to become the first Indian director of the Indian Institute of Science. 
> He founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. 
> He established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to his last days.
>
> The Raman effect was discovered on 28 February 1928. 
> The day is celebrated annually by the Government of India as the National Science Day.
