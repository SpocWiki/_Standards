> Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) 
> was an American theoretical physicist. 
> 
> He is best known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, 
> the theory of quantum electrodynamics, 
> the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, 
> and in particle physics, for which he proposed the parton model. 
> 
> For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, 
> Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.
>
> Feynman developed a pictorial representation scheme 
> for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, 
> which later became known as Feynman diagrams and is widely used. 
> 
> During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. 
> In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, 
> he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.
>
> He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II 
> and became known to the wider public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, 
> the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. 
> 
> Along with his work in theoretical physics, 
> Feynman has been credited with having pioneered the field of quantum computing 
> and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. 
> He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.
>
> Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, 
> including a talk on top-down nanotechnology, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" (1959) 
> and the three-volumes of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1961–1964). 
> 
> He delivered lectures for lay audiences, recorded in The Character of Physical Law (1965) 
> and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985). 
> 
> Feynman also became known through his autobiographical books 
> Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985) and 
> What Do You Care What Other People Think? (1988), 
> and books written about him such as Tuva or Bust! by Ralph Leighton 
> and the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.
