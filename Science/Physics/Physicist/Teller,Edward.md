> Edward Teller (Hungarian: Teller Ede; January 15, 1908 – September 9, 2003) 
> was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist and chemical engineer 
> who is known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb" 
> and one of the creators of the Teller–Ulam design inspired by Stanisław Ulam. 
> 
> He had a volatile personality, and was 
> "driven by his megaton ambitions, had a messianic complex, and displayed autocratic behavior." 
> He devised a thermonuclear Alarm Clock bomb with a yield of 1000 MT (1 GT of TNT) 
> and proposed delivering it by boat or submarine to incinerate a continent.
>
> Born in Austria-Hungary in 1908, Teller emigrated to the US in the 1930s, 
> one of the many so-called "Martians", a group of Hungarian scientist émigrés. 
> 
> He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy, and surface physics. 
> His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of Gamow–Teller transitions, 
> provided an important stepping stone in its application, 
> while the Jahn–Teller effect and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory 
> have retained their original formulation and are mainstays in physics and chemistry. 
> 
> Teller analyzed his problems using basic principles of physics 
> and often discussed with his cohorts to make headway through difficult problems. 
> This was seen when he worked with Stanislaw Ulam to get a workable thermonuclear fusion bomb design, but later temperamentally dismissed Ulam's aid. 
> Herbert York stated that Teller utilized Ulam's general idea of compressive heating 
> to start thermonuclear fusion to generate his own sketch of a workable "Super" bomb. 
> 
> Prior to Ulam's idea, Teller's classical Super was essentially a system for 
> heating uncompressed liquid deuterium to the point, Teller hoped, 
> that it would sustain thermonuclear burning. 
> 
> It was, in essence, a simple idea from physical principles, 
> which Teller pursued with a ferocious tenacity even if he was wrong 
> and shown that it would not work. 
> To get support from Washington for his Super weapon project, 
> Teller proposed a thermonuclear radiation implosion experiment as the "George" shot of Operation Greenhouse.
>
> Teller made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, 
> a standard tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. 
> In 1953, with Nicholas Metropolis, Arianna Rosenbluth, Marshall Rosenbluth, and Augusta Teller, 
> Teller co-authored a paper that is a starting point for the application of 
> the Monte Carlo method to statistical mechanics 
> and the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature in Bayesian statistics. 
> 
> Teller was an early member of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. 
> He made a concerted push to develop fusion-based weapons, 
> but ultimately fusion bombs only appeared after World War II. 
> He co-founded the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and was its director or associate director. 
> After his controversial negative testimony in the Oppenheimer security clearance hearing 
> of his former Los Alamos Laboratory superior, J. Robert Oppenheimer, 
> the scientific community ostracized Teller.
>
> Teller continued to find support from the US government and military research establishment, 
> particularly for his advocacy for nuclear power development, a strong nuclear arsenal, 
> and a vigorous nuclear testing program. 
> 
> In his later years, he advocated controversial technological solutions to military and civilian problems, 
> including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using a thermonuclear explosive 
> in what was called Project Chariot, and Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. 
> Teller was a recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award and Albert Einstein Award. He died in 2003, at 95.
