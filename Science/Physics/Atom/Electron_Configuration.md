> In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, 
> the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule 
> (or other physical structure) in atomic or molecular orbitals. 
> For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6, 
> meaning that the 1s, 2s, and 2p subshells are occupied by two, two, and six electrons, respectively.
>
> Electronic configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital, 
> in an average field created by the nuclei and all the other electrons. 
> Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions.
>
> According to the laws of quantum mechanics, a level of energy is associated with each electron configuration. 
> In certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another 
> by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.
>
> Knowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in 
> understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements, 
> for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together, 
> and in understanding the chemical formulas of compounds and the geometries of molecules. 
> 
> In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.
