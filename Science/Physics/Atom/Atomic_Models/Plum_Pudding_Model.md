## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The plum pudding model is an obsolete scientific model of the atom. 
> It was first proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904 following his discovery of the electron in 1897, 
> and was rendered obsolete by Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911. 
> 
> The model tried to account for two properties of atoms then known: 
> that there are electrons, and that atoms have no net electric charge. 
> Logically there had to be an equal amount of positive charge 
> to balance out the negative charge of the electrons. 
> 
> As Thomson had no idea as to the source of this positive charge, 
> he tentatively proposed that it was everywhere in the atom, and that the atom was spherical. 
> 
> This was the mathematically simplest hypothesis to fit the available evidence, or lack thereof. 
> In such a sphere, the negatively charged electrons would distribute themselves 
> in a more or less even manner throughout the volume, 
> simultaneously repelling each other while being attracted to the positive sphere's center.
>
> Despite Thomson's efforts, his model couldn't account for emission spectra and valencies. 
> Based on experimental studies of alpha particle scattering (in the gold foil experiment), 
> Ernest Rutherford developed an alternative model for the atom 
> featuring a compact nucleus where the positive charge is concentrated.
>
> Thomson's model is popularly referred to as the "plum pudding model" 
> with the notion that the electrons are distributed uniformly like raisins in a plum pudding. 
> Neither Thomson nor his colleagues ever used this analogy. 
> It seems to have been coined by popular science writers 
> to make the model easier to understand for the layman. 
> 
> The analogy is perhaps misleading because Thomson likened the positive sphere to a liquid 
> rather than a solid since he thought the electrons moved around in it.
