> Compton scattering (or the Compton effect) is the quantum theory of scattering 
> of a high-frequency photon through an interaction with a charged particle, usually an electron. 
> 
> Specifically, when the photon interacts with a loosely bound electron, 
> it releases the electron from an outer valence shell of an atom or molecule.
>
> The effect was discovered in 1923 by Arthur Holly Compton 
> while researching the scattering of X-rays by light elements, 
> which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. 
> 
> The Compton effect significantly deviated from dominating classical theories, 
> using both special relativity and quantum mechanics 
> to explain the interaction between high frequency photons and charged particles.
>
> Photons can interact with matter at the atomic level 
> (e.g. photoelectric effect and Rayleigh scattering), at the nucleus, or with only an electron. 
> 
> Pair production and the Compton effect occur at the level of the electron. 
> When a high-frequency photon scatters due to an interaction with a charged particle, 
> the photon's energy is reduced, and thus its wavelength is increased.  
> This trade-off between wavelength and energy in response to the collision is the Compton effect.  
> Because of conservation of energy, the energy that is lost by the photon 
> is transferred to the recoiling particle 
> (such an electron would be called a "Compton recoil electron").
>
> This implies that if the recoiling particle initially carried more energy than the photon has, 
> the reverse would occur. 
> This is known as inverse Compton scattering, in which the scattered photon increases in energy.
