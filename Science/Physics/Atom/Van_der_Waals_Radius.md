> The van der Waals radius, rw, of an atom is the radius of an imaginary hard sphere 
> representing the distance of closest approach for another atom. 
>
> It is named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, 
> winner of the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physics, 
> as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply points 
> and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size 
> through the van der Waals equation of state.
