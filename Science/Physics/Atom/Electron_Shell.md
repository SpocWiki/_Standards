> In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as 
> an orbit that electrons follow around an atom's nucleus. 
> 
> The closest shell to the nucleus is called the "1 shell" (also called the "K shell"), 
> followed by the "2 shell" (or "L shell"), then the "3 shell" (or "M shell"), 
> and so on further and further from the nucleus. 
> 
> The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) 
> or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M, ...). 
> Each period on the conventional periodic table of elements represents an electron shell.
>
> Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: 
> - the first shell can hold up to two electrons, 
> - the second shell can hold up to eight electrons, 
> - the third shell can hold up to 18, 
> continuing as the general formula of the nth shell being able to hold up to 2(n2) electrons. 
> For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells, see electron configuration.
>
> Each shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals.
