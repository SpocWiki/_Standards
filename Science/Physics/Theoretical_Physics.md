## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that employs mathematical models 
> and abstractions of physical objects and systems 
> to rationalize, explain, and predict natural phenomena. 
> 
> This is in contrast to experimental physics, 
> which uses experimental tools to probe these phenomena.
>
> The advancement of science generally 
> depends on the interplay between experimental studies and theory. 
> 
> In some cases, theoretical physics adheres to standards of mathematical rigour 
> while giving little weight to experiments and observations. 
> 
> For example, while developing special relativity, 
> Albert Einstein was concerned with the Lorentz transformation 
> which left Maxwell's equations invariant, 
> but was apparently uninterested in the Michelson–Morley experiment 
> on Earth's drift through a luminiferous aether. 
> 
> Conversely, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect, 
> previously an experimental result lacking a theoretical formulation.
