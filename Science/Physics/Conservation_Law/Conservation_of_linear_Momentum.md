> In Newtonian mechanics, momentum (pl.: momenta or momentums; 
> more specifically linear momentum or translational momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum p (from Latin pellere "push, drive") is: p = m v
>
> In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement of momentum 
> is the kilogram metre per second (kg⋅m/s), which is dimensionally equivalent to the newton-second.
>
> Newton's second law of motion states that the rate of change of a body's momentum 
> is equal to the net force acting on it. 
> 
> Momentum depends on the frame of reference, 
> but in any inertial frame of reference, it is a conserved quantity, 
> meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, 
> its total momentum does not change. 
> 
> Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) 
> and, in a modified form,  in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, 
> and general relativity. 
> 
> It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry.
>
> Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, 
> allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. 
> In these systems the conserved quantity is  generalized momentum, 
> and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. 
> The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, 
> where it becomes an operator on a wave function. 
> 
> The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
>
> In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics and deformable bodies, 
> a momentum density can be defined as momentum per volume (a volume-specific quantity). 
> 
> A continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the 
> Navier–Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids.
