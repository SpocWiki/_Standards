> Angular momentum (sometimes called moment of momentum or rotational momentum) 
> is the rotational analog of linear momentum. 
> 
> It is an important physical quantity because it is a conserved quantity – 
> the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.  
> 
> Angular momentum has both a direction and a magnitude, and both are conserved.  
> Bicycles and motorcycles, flying discs, rifled bullets, and gyroscopes 
> owe their useful properties to conservation of angular momentum.  
> 
> Conservation of angular momentum is also why hurricanes form spirals 
> and neutron stars have high rotational rates.  
> In general, conservation limits the possible motion of a system, but it does not uniquely determine it.

> The three-dimensional angular momentum for a point particle 
> is classically represented as a pseudovector r × p, 
> the cross product of the particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector; 
> the latter is p = mv in Newtonian mechanics. 
> Unlike linear momentum, angular momentum depends on where this origin is chosen, 
> since the particle's position is measured from it.
>
> Angular momentum is an extensive quantity; that is, 
> the total angular momentum of any composite system 
> is the sum of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. 
> 
> For a continuous rigid body or a fluid, 
> the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density 
> (angular momentum per unit volume in the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.

> Similar to conservation of linear momentum, where it is conserved if there is no external force, 
> angular momentum is conserved if there is no external torque.  
> Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to force. 
> The net external torque on any system is always equal to the total torque on the system; 
> the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 
> (this is the rotational analogue of Newton's third law of motion). 
> 
> Therefore, for a closed system (where there is no net external torque), 
> the total torque on the system must be 0, 
> which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant.
>
> The change in angular momentum for a particular interaction is called angular impulse, 
> sometimes twirl. 
> Angular impulse is the angular analog of (linear) impulse.
