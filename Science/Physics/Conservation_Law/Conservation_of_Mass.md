## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system which is closed to all incoming and outgoing transfers of matter, the mass of the system must remain constant over time.
>
> The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form. For example, in chemical reactions, the mass of the chemical components before the reaction is equal to the mass of the components after the reaction. Thus, during any chemical reaction and low-energy thermodynamic processes in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants, or starting materials, must be equal to the mass of the products.
>
> The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. Historically, mass conservation in chemical reactions was primarily demonstrated in the 17th century and finally confirmed by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century. The formulation of this law was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry.
>
> In general, mass is not conserved. The conservation of mass is a law that holds only in the classical limit. For example, the overlap of the electron and positron wave functions, where the interacting particles are nearly at rest, will proceed to annihilate via electromagnetic interaction. This process creates two photons and is the mechanism for PET scans.
>
> Mass is also not generally conserved in open systems. Such is the case when any energy or matter is allowed into, or out of, the system. However, unless radioactivity or nuclear reactions are involved, the amount of energy entering or escaping such systems (as heat, mechanical work, or electromagnetic radiation) is usually too small to be measured as a change in the mass of the system.
>
> For systems that include large gravitational fields, general relativity has to be taken into account; thus mass–energy conservation becomes a more complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity.
