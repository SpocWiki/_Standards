# [[Conservation_of_Charge]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, charge conservation is the principle, of experimental nature, 
> that the total electric charge in an isolated system never changes.  
> 
> The net quantity of electric charge, 
> the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge in the universe, is always conserved.   
> 
> Charge conservation, considered as a physical conservation law, 
> implies that the change in the amount of electric charge in any volume of space 
> is exactly equal to the amount of charge flowing into the volume 
> minus the amount of charge flowing out of the volume.  
> 
> In essence, charge conservation is an accounting relationship between the amount of charge in a region and the flow of charge into and out of that region, given by a continuity equation between 
> charge density ρ(x)
> and current density J(x) .
>
> This does not mean that individual positive and negative charges cannot be created or destroyed.  
> Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles such as electrons and protons. 
> Charged particles can be created and destroyed in elementary particle reactions.  
> In particle physics, charge conservation means that in reactions that create charged particles, 
> equal numbers of positive and negative particles are always created, 
> keeping the net amount of charge unchanged. 
> Similarly, when particles are destroyed, 
> equal numbers of positive and negative charges are destroyed. 
> This property is supported without exception by all empirical observations so far.
>
> Although conservation of charge requires that the total quantity of charge in the universe is constant, it leaves open the question of what that quantity is.  
> Most evidence indicates that the net charge in the universe is zero; 
> that is, there are equal quantities of positive and negative charge.
