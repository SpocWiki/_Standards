## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Surfactant** is a chemical compound 
> that decreases the surface tension or interfacial tension between two liquids, 
> a liquid and a gas, or a liquid and a solid. 
> 
> The word surfactant is a blend of "surface-active agent", coined in 1950. 
> As they consist of a water-repellent and a water-attracting part, 
> they are emulsifiers, enabling water and oil to mix. 
> 
> They can also form foam, and facilitate the detachment of dirt. 
>
> Surfactants are among the most widespread and commercially important chemicals. 
> Private households as well as many industries use them in large quantities 
> as detergents and cleaning agents, but also as emulsifiers, 
> wetting agents, foaming agents, antistatic additives, and dispersants. 
>
> Surfactants occur naturally in traditional plant-based detergents, 
> e.g. horse chestnuts or soap nuts; 
> they can also be found in the secretions of some caterpillars. 
> 
> Some of the most commonly used anionic surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfates (LAS), 
> are produced from petroleum products. 
> 
> However, surfactants are increasingly produced in whole or in part 
> from renewable biomass, like sugar, fatty alcohol from vegetable oils, 
> by-products of biofuel production, and other biogenic material.
