> Bernoulli's principle is a key concept in fluid dynamics that relates pressure, speed and height. 
> For example, for a fluid flowing horizontally Bernoulli's principle states that 
> an increase in the speed  occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure 
> 
> The principle is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli, 
> who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in 1738. 
> Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, 
> it was Leonhard Euler in 1752 who derived Bernoulli's equation in its usual form.
>
> Bernoulli's principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. 
> This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid is the same 
> at all points that are free of viscous forces. 
> 
> This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy 
> and internal energy remains constant. 
> 
> Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid—implying an increase in its kinetic energy—
> occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its potential energy 
> (including the static pressure) and internal energy. 
> 
> If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and gravitational potential ρ g h) is the same everywhere.
>
> Bernoulli's principle can also be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second law of motion. When a fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, there is more pressure from behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline. 
>
> Fluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.
>
> Bernoulli's principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: 
> when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) 
> and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. thermal radiation) are small and can be neglected. 
> 
> However, the principle can be applied to various types of flow within these bounds, 
> resulting in various forms of Bernoulli's equation. 
> 
> The simple form of Bernoulli's equation is valid for incompressible flows 
> (e.g. most liquid flows and gases moving at low Mach number). 
> More advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher Mach numbers.
