> When two fluid layers move relative to each other, 
> a friction force develops between them 
> and the slower layer acts to slow down the faster layer. 
> 
> This internal resistance to flow is described by the fluid property called **Viscosity**, 
> which reflects the internal stickiness of the fluid. 
> 
> - In liquids, viscosity arises from cohesive molecular forces, while 
> - in gases it results from molecular collisions. 
> Except for the case of superfluidity, there is no fluid with zero viscosity, 
> and thus all fluid flows involve viscous effects to some degree.
>
> For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of thickness; 
> for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water. 
> 
> Viscosity is defined scientifically as a force multiplied by a time divided by an area. 
> Thus its SI units are newton-seconds per metre squared, or pascal-seconds.
>
> For instance, when a viscous fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's center line than near its walls. Some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow. This is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion. For a tube with a constant rate of flow, the strength of the compensating force is proportional to the fluid's viscosity.
>
> In general, viscosity depends on a fluid's state, such as its temperature, pressure, and rate of deformation. However, the dependence on some of these properties is negligible in certain cases. For example, the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid does not vary significantly with the rate of deformation. 
>
> Zero viscosity (no resistance to shear stress) is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids; otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity. A fluid that has zero viscosity (non-viscous) is called ideal or inviscid.
>
> For non-Newtonian fluids' viscosity, there are pseudoplastic, plastic, and dilatant flows that are time-independent, and there are thixotropic and rheopectic flows that are time-dependent.
