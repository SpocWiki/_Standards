> The Schwarzschild radius is a parameter in the Schwarzschild solution 
> to Einstein's field equations 
> that corresponds to the radius of a spherical event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. 
> 
> It is a characteristic quantity that may be associated with any quantity of mass. 
> The Schwarzschild radius was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, 
> who calculated this solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916 before he died in [[../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~3~Anthropocene/Modern_History/CE_1900/1914-World_War_I|WWI]] .

> The Schwarzschild radius is given as r_s = 2GM / c²
