## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Michelson–Morley experiment was an attempt 
> to measure the motion of the Earth relative to the luminiferous aether, 
> a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves. 
> 
> The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 
> by American physicists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley 
> at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, 
> and published in November of the same year.

> The experiment compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter, including their laboratory, through the luminiferous aether, or "aether wind" as it was sometimes called. The result was negative, in that Michelson and Morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles. This result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against some aether theories, as well as initiating a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out motion against an aether. Of this experiment, Albert Einstein wrote, "If the Michelson–Morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment, no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a (halfway) redemption."

> Michelson–Morley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity. These include experiments from 1902 to 1905, and a series of experiments in the 1920s. More recently, in 2009, optical resonator experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10−17 level. Together with the Ives–Stilwell and Kennedy–Thorndike experiments, Michelson–Morley type experiments form one of the fundamental tests of special relativity.
