### nominal 

Unlike the other scales, no kind of relationship between the classes can be relied upon. Thus measuring with the nominal scale is equivalent to [classifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifying "Classifying"). 

###  ordinal 

Dichotomous Data should be considered Nominal. 
**non-dichotomous** data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 
"completely agree", "mostly agree", "mostly disagree", "completely disagree" 

### interval 

### ratio 

## Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) 

Mosteller and Tukey noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed seven instead:

1. Names
2. Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
3. Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
4. Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
5. Counts (non-negative integers)
6. Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
7. Balances (any real number) 

## Chrisman's typology (1998) 

Nicholas R. Chrisman introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. 
Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:

1. Nominal
2. Gradation of membership
3. Ordinal
4. Interval
5. Log-interval
6. Extensive ratio
7. Cyclical ratio
8. Derived ratio
9. Counts
10. Absolute
