[[../../../Science/Physics/Measurement/Accuracy]] = [[Trueness]] AND [[../../../Science/Physics/Measurement/Precision]] 

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines trueness as, 
"the closeness of agreement between the arithmetic mean of a large number of test results and the true or accepted reference value."

> More commonly, a description of systematic errors (a measure of statistical bias of a given measure of central tendency, such as the mean). In this definition of "accuracy", the concept is independent of "precision", so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate, precise, both, or neither. This concept corresponds to ISO's trueness.

> A combination of both precision and trueness, accounting for the two types of observational error (random and systematic), so that high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness. This usage corresponds to ISO's definition of accuracy (trueness and precision).
