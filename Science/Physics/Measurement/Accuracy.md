[[Accuracy]] = [[Trueness]] AND [[Precision]] 

Accuracy describes the Influence of **systematic errors**. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **combination of both precision and trueness**, 
> accounting for both types of observational error (**both random and systematic**), 
> so that high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness. 
> This usage corresponds to ISO's definition of accuracy (trueness and precision).
>
> **Accuracy** and precision are measures of observational error; 
> - [[Accuracy]] is how close a given set of measurements is to the true value and 
> - [[Precision]] is how close the measurements are to each other.
>
> The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines a related measure:
> trueness, "the closeness of agreement between the arithmetic mean of a large number of test results and the true or accepted reference value."
>
> While **precision is a description of random errors** (a measure of statistical variability),
>
> Accuracy has two different definitions:
>
> More commonly, a description of systematic errors 
> (a measure of statistical bias of a given measure of central tendency, such as the mean). 
> In this definition of "accuracy", the concept is independent of "precision", 
> so a particular set of data can be said to be accurate, precise, both, or neither. 
> This concept corresponds to ISO's **trueness**.
