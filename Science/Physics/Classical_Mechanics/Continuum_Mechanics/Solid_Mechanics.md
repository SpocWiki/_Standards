> Solid mechanics (also known as mechanics of solids) is the branch of continuum mechanics 
> that studies the behavior of solid materials, especially their motion and deformation under the 
> - action of forces, 
> - temperature changes, 
> - phase changes, 
> - and other external or internal agents.
>
> Solid mechanics is fundamental for civil, aerospace, nuclear, biomedical and mechanical engineering, 
> for geology, and for many branches of physics and chemistry such as materials science. 
> 
> It has specific applications in many other areas, such as 
> understanding the anatomy of living beings, 
> and the design of dental prostheses and surgical implants. 
> 
> One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics 
> is the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation. 
> 
> Solid mechanics extensively uses tensors to describe stresses, strains, 
> and the relationship between them.
>
> Solid mechanics is a vast subject because of the wide range of solid materials available, 
> such as steel, wood, concrete, biological materials, textiles, geological materials, and plastics.
