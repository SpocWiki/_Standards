> **Statics** is the branch of classical mechanics 
> that is concerned with the analysis of force and torque acting on a physical system 
> that does not experience an acceleration, but rather is in equilibrium with its environment. 
>
> If F  is the total of the forces acting on the system, 
> m  is the mass of the system and 
> a  is the acceleration of the system, Newton's second law states that F = m a
>  (the bold font indicates a vector quantity, i.e. one with both magnitude and direction). 
>  
>  If a = 0, then F = 0. 
>  
>  As for a system in static equilibrium, the acceleration equals zero, 
>  the system is either at rest, or its center of mass moves at constant velocity. 
>
> The application of the assumption of zero acceleration to the summation of moments acting on the system 
> leads to M = I α = 0, where 
> M is the summation of all moments acting on the system, 
> I  is the moment of inertia of the mass and 
> α  is the angular acceleration of the system. 
>
> Together, the equations 
>  (the 'first condition for equilibrium') and 
>  (the 'second condition for equilibrium') can be used to solve for unknown quantities acting on the system.
