## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws 
> that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. 
> 
> These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, 
> can be paraphrased as follows:
> - A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, 
>   unless it is acted upon by a force.
> - At any instant of time, the net force on a body 
> - is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, 
>   equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
> - If two bodies exert forces on each other, 
>   these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.
>
> The three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton 
> in his PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica 
> (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally published in 1687. 
> 
> Newton used them to investigate 
> and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems. 
> 
> In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, 
> built the field of classical mechanics on his foundations. 
> 
> Limitations to Newton's laws have also been discovered; 
> new theories are necessary when objects 
> - move at very high speeds (special relativity), 
> - are very massive (general relativity), 
> - or are very small (quantum mechanics).
