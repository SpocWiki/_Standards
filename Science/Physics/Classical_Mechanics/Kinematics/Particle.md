> In the physical sciences, a **Particle** (or corpuscle in older texts) is a small localized object 
> which can be described by several physical or chemical properties, such as volume, density, or mass. 
> 
> They vary greatly in size or quantity, from subatomic particles like the electron, 
> to microscopic particles like atoms and molecules, 
> to macroscopic particles like powders and other granular materials. 
> 
> Particles can also be used to create scientific models of even larger objects 
> depending on their density, such as humans moving in a crowd or celestial bodies in motion.
>
> The term particle is rather general in meaning, and is refined as needed by various scientific fields. 
> 
> Anything that is composed of particles may be referred to as being particulate. 
> However, the noun particulate is most frequently used 
> to refer to pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere, which are a suspension of unconnected particles, 
> rather than a connected particle aggregation.
