> In physics, **Kinematics** studies the geometrical aspects of motion of physical objects 
> independent of forces that set them in motion. 
> 
> Constrained motion such as linked machine parts are also described as kinematics.
>
> Kinematics is concerned with systems of specification of objects' positions and velocities 
> and mathematical transformations between such systems. 
> 
> These systems may be rectangular like Cartesian, 
> Curvilinear coordinates like polar coordinates or other systems. 
> 
> The object trajectories may be specified with respect to other objects 
> which may themselves be in motion relative to a standard reference. 
> Rotating systems may also be used.
>
> Numerous practical problems in kinematics involve constraints, 
> such as mechanical linkages, ropes, or rolling disks.
