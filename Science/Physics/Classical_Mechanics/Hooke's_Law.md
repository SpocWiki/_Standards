## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, Hooke's law is an empirical law which states that 
> the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) 
> scales linearly with respect to that distance—that is, F = kx, 
> where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), 
> and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring. 
> 
> The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. 
> He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin anagram. 
> He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: ut tensio, sic vis 
> ("as the extension, so the force" or "the extension is proportional to the force"). 
> Hooke states in the 1678 work that he was aware of the law since 1660.
>
> Hooke's equation holds (to some extent) in many other situations 
> where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, 
> and a musician plucking a string of a guitar. 
> 
> An elastic body or material for which this equation can be assumed 
> is said to be linear-elastic or Hookean.
>
> Hooke's law is only a first-order linear approximation to the real response of springs 
> and other elastic bodies to applied forces. 
> It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, 
> since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, 
> or stretched beyond a maximum size, 
> without some permanent deformation or change of state. 
> 
> Many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law 
> well before those elastic limits are reached.
>
> On the other hand, Hooke's law is an accurate approximation for most solid bodies, 
> as long as the forces and deformations are small enough. 
> 
> For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, 
> and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics. 
> It is also the fundamental principle behind the spring scale, the manometer, 
> the galvanometer, and the balance wheel of the mechanical clock.
>
> The modern theory of elasticity generalizes Hooke's law to say that 
> the strain (deformation) of an elastic object or material is proportional to the stress applied to it. 
> 
> However, since general stresses and strains may have multiple independent components, 
> the "proportionality factor" may no longer be just a single real number, 
> but rather a linear map (a tensor) that can be represented by a matrix of real numbers.
>
> In this general form, Hooke's law makes it possible to 
> deduce the relation between strain and stress for complex objects 
> in terms of intrinsic properties of the materials they are made of. 
> 
> For example, one can deduce that a homogeneous rod with uniform cross section 
> will behave like a simple spring when stretched, 
> with a stiffness k directly proportional to its cross-section area 
> and inversely proportional to its length.
