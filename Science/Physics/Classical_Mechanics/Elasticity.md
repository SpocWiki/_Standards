> In physics and materials science, elasticity is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence 
> and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed. 
> 
> Solid objects will deform when adequate loads are applied to them; 
> if the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size after removal. 
> This is in contrast to plasticity, in which the object fails to do so and instead remains in its deformed state.
>
> The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials. 
> In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system). 
> When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state. 
> For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied.
>
> Hooke's law states that the force required to deform elastic objects 
> should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. 
> This is known as perfect elasticity, in which a given object will return to its original shape 
> no matter how strongly it is deformed. 
> This is an ideal concept only; most materials which possess elasticity in practice 
> remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, after which plastic (permanent) deformation occurs.
>
> In engineering, the elasticity of a material is quantified by the elastic modulus 
> such as the Young's modulus, bulk modulus or shear modulus 
> which measure the amount of stress needed to achieve a unit of strain; 
> a higher modulus indicates that the material is harder to deform. 
> 
> The SI unit of this modulus is the pascal (Pa). 
> The material's elastic limit or yield strength is the maximum stress that can arise 
> before the onset of plastic deformation. Its SI unit is also the pascal (Pa).
