> An intermolecular force (IMF; also secondary force) 
> is the force that mediates interaction between molecules, 
> including the electromagnetic forces of attraction or repulsion 
> which act between atoms and other types of neighbouring particles (e.g. atoms or ions). 
> 
> Intermolecular forces are weak relative to intramolecular forces – 
> the forces which hold a molecule together. 
> 
> For example, the covalent bond, involving sharing electron pairs between atoms, 
> is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules. 
> Both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.
>
> The first reference to the nature of microscopic forces is found in Alexis Clairaut's work 
> Théorie de la figure de la Terre, published in Paris in 1743. 
> Other scientists who have contributed to the investigation of microscopic forces include: 
> Laplace, Gauss, Maxwell, Boltzmann and Pauling.
>
> Attractive intermolecular forces are categorized into the following types:
> - Hydrogen bonding
> - Ion–dipole forces and ion–induced dipole force
> - Cation–π, σ–π and π–π bonding
> - Van der Waals forces – Keesom force, Debye force, and London dispersion force
> - Cation–cation bonding
> - Salt bridge (protein and supramolecular)
>
> Information on intermolecular forces is obtained by macroscopic measurements 
> of properties like viscosity, pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) data. 
> The link to microscopic aspects is given by virial coefficients and intermolecular pair potentials, such as the Mie potential, Buckingham potential or Lennard-Jones potential.
>
> In the broadest sense, it can be understood as such interactions between any particles 
> (molecules, atoms, ions and molecular ions) in which the formation of chemical 
> (that is, ionic, covalent or metallic) bonds does not occur. 
> 
> In other words, **these interactions are significantly weaker than covalent ones** 
> and do not lead to a significant restructuring of the interacting particles. 
> 
> This is only partially true. 
> For example, all enzymatic and catalytic reactions 
> begin with a weak intermolecular interaction between a substrate and an enzyme 
> or a molecule with a catalyst. 
> But several such weak interactions 
> with the required spatial configuration of the active center of the enzyme 
> lead to significant restructuring in the energy states of molecules or substrates, 
> all of which ultimately leads to the breaking of some 
> and the formation of other covalent chemical bonds. 
> 
> All enzymatic reactions begin with intermolecular interactions 
> between the substrate and the enzyme, 
> therefore the importance of these interactions is especially great in biochemistry and molecular biology, and is the basis of enzymology.
