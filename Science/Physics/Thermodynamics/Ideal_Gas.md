> An ideal gas is a theoretical gas composed of many randomly moving point particles 
> that are not subject to interparticle interactions. 
> 
> The ideal gas concept is useful because it obeys the ideal gas law, 
> a simplified equation of state, and is amenable to analysis under statistical mechanics. 
> The requirement of zero interaction can often be relaxed if, for example, 
> the interaction is perfectly elastic or regarded as point-like collisions.
>
> Under various conditions of temperature and pressure, 
> many real gases behave qualitatively like an ideal gas 
> where the gas molecules (or atoms for monatomic gas) play the role of the ideal particles. 
> 
> Many gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, noble gases, 
> some heavier gases like carbon dioxide and mixtures such as air, 
> can be treated as ideal gases within reasonable tolerances 
> over a considerable parameter range around standard temperature and pressure. 
> 
> Generally, a gas behaves more like an ideal gas at higher temperature and lower pressure, 
> as the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes less significant 
> compared with the particles' kinetic energy, 
> and the size of the molecules becomes less significant 
> compared to the empty space between them. 
> 
> One mole of an ideal gas has a volume of 22.71095464... L (exact value as of 2019 revision of the SI) 
> at standard temperature and pressure (a temperature of 273.15 K and an absolute pressure of exactly 105 Pa).
>
> The ideal gas model tends to fail at lower temperatures or higher pressures, 
> where intermolecular forces and molecular size become important.  
> 
> It also fails for most heavy gases, such as many refrigerants, 
> and for gases with **strong intermolecular forces, notably water vapor**. 
> 
> At high pressures, the volume of a real gas is often considerably larger than that of an ideal gas. 
> At low temperatures, the pressure of a real gas is often considerably less than that of an ideal gas. 
> At some point of low temperature and high pressure, real gases undergo a phase transition, 
> such as to a liquid or a solid. 
> 
> The model of an ideal gas, however, does not describe or allow phase transitions.  
> These must be modeled by more complex equations of state. 
> The deviation from the ideal gas behavior can be described by a dimensionless quantity, 
> the compressibility factor, Z.
>
> The ideal gas model has been explored in both the Newtonian dynamics (as in "kinetic theory") 
> and in quantum mechanics (as a "gas in a box"). 
> 
> The ideal gas model has also been used to model the behavior of electrons in a metal 
> (in the Drude model and the free electron model), 
> and it is one of the most important models in statistical mechanics.
>
> If the pressure of an ideal gas is reduced in a throttling process 
> **the temperature of an ideal gas does not change**. 
> (If the pressure of a real gas is reduced in a throttling process, its temperature either falls or rises, 
> depending on whether its Joule–Thomson coefficient is positive or negative.)
