# [[State_Function]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[../../../WikiData/WD~State_function,230937|WD~State_function,230937]]  

measurable characteristic of the current state of a thermodynamic system, 
independent of the history of the system.

> In the thermodynamics of equilibrium, 
> a state function, function of state, or point function for a thermodynamic system 
> is a mathematical function relating several state variables or state quantities 
> (that describe equilibrium states of a system) 
> that depend only on the current equilibrium thermodynamic state of the system 
> (e.g. gas, liquid, solid, crystal, or emulsion), 
> not the path which the system has taken to reach that state. 
> 
> A state function describes equilibrium states of a system, 
> thus also describing the type of system. 
> 
> A state variable is typically a state function 
> so the determination of other state variable values at an equilibrium state 
> also determines the value of the state variable as the state function at that state. 
> 
> The ideal gas law is a good example. 
> In this law, one state variable (e.g., pressure, volume, temperature, 
> or the amount of substance in a gaseous equilibrium system) 
> is a function of other state variables so is regarded as a state function. 
> 
> A state function could also describe the number of a certain type of atoms or molecules in a gaseous, liquid, or solid form in a heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture, or the amount of energy required to create such a system or change the system into a different equilibrium state.
>
> Internal energy, enthalpy, and entropy 
> are examples of state quantities or state functions 
> because they quantitatively describe an equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system, regardless of how the system has arrived in that state. 
> 
> They are expressed by exact differentials. 
> In contrast, mechanical work and heat are process quantities or path functions 
> because their values depend on a specific "transition" (or "path") 
> between two equilibrium states that a system has taken to reach the final equilibrium state, being expressed by inexact differentials. Exchanged heat (in certain discrete amounts) can be associated with changes of state function such as enthalpy. The description of the system heat exchange is done by a state function, and thus enthalpy changes point to an amount of heat. This can also apply to entropy when heat is compared to temperature. The description breaks down for quantities exhibiting hysteresis.
