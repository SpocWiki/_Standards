## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Fluctuation–dissipation theorem** (FDT) or fluctuation–dissipation relation (FDR) is a powerful tool in statistical physics for predicting the behavior of systems that obey detailed balance. Given that a system obeys detailed balance, the theorem is a proof that thermodynamic fluctuations in a physical variable  predict the response quantified by the admittance or impedance (in their general sense, not only in electromagnetic terms) of the same physical variable (like voltage, temperature difference, etc.), and vice versa. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem applies both to classical and quantum mechanical systems.

> The fluctuation–dissipation theorem was proven by Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton in 1951
