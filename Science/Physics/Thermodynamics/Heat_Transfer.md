> Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use, 
> conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. 
> 
> Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as 
> - thermal conduction, 
> - thermal convection, 
> - thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by 
> - phase changes. 
> 
> Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species 
> (mass transfer in the form of advection), either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. 
> While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, 
> they often occur simultaneously in the same system.
>
> Heat conduction, also called diffusion, 
> is the direct microscopic exchanges of kinetic energy of particles (such as molecules) 
> or quasiparticles (such as lattice waves) through the boundary between two systems. 
> When an object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings, 
> heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, 
> at which point they are in thermal equilibrium. 
> 
> Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature 
> to another region of lower temperature, as described in the second law of thermodynamics.
>
> Heat convection occurs when the bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries its heat through the fluid. 
> All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. 
> The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, 
> or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces 
> caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), 
> thus influencing its own transfer. 
> The latter process is often called "natural convection". 
> The former process is often called "forced convection." 
> In this case, the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan, or other mechanical means.
>
> Thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or fluid or gas). 
> It is the transfer of energy by means of photons or electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws.
