> Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that continues forever in an unperturbed system. 
> A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine 
> that can do work indefinitely without an external energy source. 
> 
> This kind of machine is impossible, 
> since its existence would violate the first and/or second laws of thermodynamics. 
> These laws of thermodynamics apply regardless of the size of the system. 
> 
> Thus, machines that extract energy from finite sources cannot operate indefinitely 
> because they are driven by the energy stored in the source, which will eventually be exhausted. 
> 
> A common example is devices powered by ocean currents, 
> whose energy is ultimately derived from the Sun, which itself will eventually burn out.
>
> In 2016, new states of matter, time crystals, were discovered in which, on a microscopic scale, 
> the component atoms are in continual repetitive motion, 
> thus satisfying the literal definition of "perpetual motion". 
> 
> However, these do not constitute perpetual motion machines in the traditional sense, 
> or violate thermodynamic laws, because they are in their quantum ground state, 
> so no energy can be extracted from them; they exhibit motion without energy.
