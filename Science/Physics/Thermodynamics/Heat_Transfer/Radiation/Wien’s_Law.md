# [[Wien’s_Law]] 

$λ_max​=b/T​$

Where:  
λ_max​ = wavelength of maximum radiation (m)  
b=2.897e-3 m·K (Wien's displacement constant)  
T = absolute temperature in Kelvin (K) = 273.15 K + °C

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Wien's approximation (also sometimes called Wien's law or the Wien distribution law) 
> is a law of physics used to describe the spectrum of thermal radiation (blackbody function).  
> 
> This law was first derived by Wilhelm Wien in 1896.  
> The equation does accurately describe the short-wavelength (high-frequency) spectrum of 
> thermal emission from objects, 
> but it fails to accurately fit the experimental data for long-wavelength (low-frequency) emission.
