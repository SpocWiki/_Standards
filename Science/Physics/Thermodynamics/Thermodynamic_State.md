## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In thermodynamics, a thermodynamic state of a system is its condition at a specific time; 
> that is, fully identified by values of a suitable set of parameters known as state variables, 
> state parameters or thermodynamic variables. 
> 
> Once such a set of values of thermodynamic variables has been specified for a system, 
> the values of all thermodynamic properties of the system are uniquely determined. 
> 
> Usually, by default, a thermodynamic state is taken to be one of thermodynamic equilibrium. 
> This means that the state is not merely the condition of the system at a specific time, 
> but that the condition is the same, unchanging, over an indefinitely long duration of time.
