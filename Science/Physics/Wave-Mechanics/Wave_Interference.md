## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, interference is a phenomenon in which two coherent waves are combined 
> by adding their Amplitudes/displacements with due consideration for their phase difference. 
> 
> The resultant wave may have greater amplitude (constructive interference) 
> or lower amplitude (destructive interference) 
> if the two waves are in phase or out of phase, respectively.
>
> Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, 
> for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves, gravity waves, 
> or matter waves as well as in loudspeakers as electrical waves.
