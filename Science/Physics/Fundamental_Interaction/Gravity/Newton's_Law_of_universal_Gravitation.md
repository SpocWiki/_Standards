> Newton's law of universal gravitation describes gravity as a force 
> by stating that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe 
> with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses 
> and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass. 
> 
> Separated objects attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers. The publication of the law has become known as the "first great unification", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.
>
> This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton's work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for 'Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy' (the Principia)), first published on 5 July 1687. 
>
> The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:
>         F = G m_1 m_2 / r²
>
> where F is the gravitational force acting between two objects, 
> m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, 
> r is the distance between the centers of their masses, and G is the gravitational constant.

> The first test of Newton's law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton's Principia and approximately 71 years after his death.

> Newton's law of gravitation resembles Coulomb's law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies. Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies. Coulomb's law has charge in place of mass and a different constant.
>
> Newton's law was later superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications. Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the Sun).
