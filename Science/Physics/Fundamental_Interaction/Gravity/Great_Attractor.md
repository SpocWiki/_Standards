## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Great Attractor is a region of gravitational attraction in intergalactic space 
> and the apparent central gravitational point of the Laniakea Supercluster of galaxies 
> that includes the Milky Way galaxy, as well as about 100,000 other galaxies. 
>
> The observed attraction suggests a localized concentration of mass 
> having the order of 10^16 solar masses. 
> However, it is obscured by the Milky Way's galactic plane, 
> lying behind the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), 
> so that in visible light wavelengths, the Great Attractor is difficult to observe directly. 
>
> The attraction is observable by its effect on the motion of galaxies and their associated clusters 
> over a region of hundreds of millions of light-years across the universe. 
> 
> These galaxies are observable above and below the Zone of Avoidance; 
> all are redshifted in accordance with the Hubble flow, 
> indicating that they are receding relative to the Milky Way and to each other, 
> but the variations in their redshifts are large enough and regular enough 
> to reveal that they are slightly drawn towards the attraction. 
> 
> The variations in their redshifts are known as peculiar velocities, 
> and cover a range from about +700 km/s to −700 km/s, 
> depending on the angular deviation from the direction to the Great Attractor. 
> The Great Attractor itself is moving towards the Shapley Supercluster.
