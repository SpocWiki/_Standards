> **Magnetism** is the class of physical attributes that occur through a magnetic field, 
> which allows objects to attract or repel each other. 
> 
> Because both electric currents and magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, 
> magnetism is one of two aspects of electromagnetism.
>
> The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields 
> and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. 
> 
> Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. 
> Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, nickel, and their alloys.
>
> All substances exhibit some type of magnetism. 
> Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. 
> Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, 
> but there are actually several types of magnetism. 
> 
> - Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; 
> - diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; 
> - while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium, 
>   have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. 
> 
> The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials 
> is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, 
> so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.
>
> The strength of a magnetic field always decreases with distance from the magnetic source, 
> though the exact mathematical relationship between strength and distance varies. 
> Many factors can influence the magnetic field of an object including the magnetic moment of the material, 
> the physical shape of the object, both the magnitude and direction 
> of any electric current present within the object, and the temperature of the object.
