> A **Magnet** is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. 
> This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: 
> a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. 
> and attracts or repels other magnets.
>
> A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized 
> and creates its own persistent magnetic field. 
> 
> An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. 
> Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, 
> are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). 
> These include the elements iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some alloys of rare-earth metals, 
> and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone. 
> 
> Although ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials are the only ones 
> attracted to a magnet strongly enough to be commonly considered magnetic, 
> all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of magnetism.
>
> Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into 
> - magnetically "soft" materials like annealed iron, which can be magnetized 
>   but do not tend to stay magnetized, and 
> - magnetically "hard" materials, which stay magnetized. 
> 
> Permanent magnets are made from "hard" ferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite 
> that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture 
> to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them very hard to demagnetize. 
> 
> To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, 
> and this threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material. 
> 
> "Hard" materials have high coercivity, whereas "soft" materials have low coercivity. 
> The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, 
> alternatively, the total magnetic flux it produces. 
> 
> The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.
>
> An electromagnet is made from a coil of wire 
> that acts as a magnet when an electric current passes through it 
> but stops being a magnet when the current stops. 
> 
> Often, the coil is wrapped around a core of "soft" ferromagnetic material such as mild steel, 
> which greatly enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.
