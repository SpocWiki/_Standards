## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A black body or blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, 
> regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. 
> 
> The radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium with its environment 
> is called black-body radiation. 
> 
> The name "black body" is given because it absorbs all colors of light. 
> In contrast, a white body is one 
> with a "rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions."
>
> A black body in thermal equilibrium (that is, at a constant temperature) 
> emits electromagnetic black-body radiation. 
> The radiation is emitted according to Planck's law, 
> meaning that it has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone, 
> not by the body's shape or composition.
>
> An ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two main properties:
> - It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.
> - It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated isotropically, independent of direction.
>
> Real materials emit energy at a fraction—called the emissivity—of black-body energy levels. 
> By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity ε = 1. 
> A source with a lower emissivity, independent of frequency, is often referred to as a gray body.
>
> Constructing black bodies with an emissivity as close to 1 as possible remains a topic of current interest.
>
> In astronomy, the radiation from stars and planets is 
> sometimes characterized in terms of an effective temperature, 
> the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.
