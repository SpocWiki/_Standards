> In chemistry and physics, Raman scattering or the Raman effect 
> is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter, 
> meaning that there is both an exchange of energy and a change in the light's direction. 
> Typically this effect involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule 
> as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. 
> This is called normal Stokes-Raman scattering.

> Light has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are scattered, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency, wavelength, and therefore color) as the incident photons, but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (about 1 in a million) can be scattered inelastically, with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons—these are Raman scattered photons. Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process.

> The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of Raman spectroscopy. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow rotational energy to be examined, if gas samples are used, and electronic energy levels may be examined if an X-ray source is used, in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.
>
> The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered it in 1928 with assistance from his student K. S. Krishnan. Raman was awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of Raman scattering.
