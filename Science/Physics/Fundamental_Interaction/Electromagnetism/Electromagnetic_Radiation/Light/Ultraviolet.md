> **Ultraviolet** radiation, also known as simply UV, 
> is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths of 10–400 nanometers, 
> shorter than that of visible light, but longer than X-rays. 
> 
> UV radiation is present in sunlight, 
> and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. 
> It is also produced by electric arcs, Cherenkov radiation, and specialized lights, such as 
> mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights.
>
> The photons of ultraviolet have greater energy than those of visible light, 
> from about 3.1 to 12 electron volts, 
> around the minimum energy required to ionize atoms.  
> 
> Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation 
> because its photons lack sufficient energy, 
> it can induce chemical reactions and cause many substances to glow or fluoresce. 
> 
> Many practical applications, including chemical and biological effects, 
> are derived from the way that UV radiation can interact with organic molecules. 
> These interactions can involve absorption or adjusting energy states in molecules, 
> but do not necessarily involve heating.   
> 
> Short-wave ultraviolet light is ionizing radiation. 
> Consequently, short-wave UV damages DNA and sterilizes surfaces.
>
> For humans, suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV, 
> along with an increased risk of skin cancer. 
> 
> The amount of UV radiation produced by the Sun means that 
> the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land 
> if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere. 
> 
> More energetic, shorter-wavelength "extreme" UV below 121 nm 
> ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground. 
> 
> However, UV (specifically, UVB) is also responsible for the formation of vitamin D 
> in most land vertebrates, including humans. 
> 
> The UV spectrum, thus, has effects both beneficial and detrimental to life.
>
> The lower wavelength limit of the visible spectrum is conventionally taken as 400 nm.  
> 
> Although ultraviolet rays are not generally visible to humans, 
> 400 nm is not a sharp cutoff, 
> with shorter and shorter wavelengths becoming less and less visible in this range.  
> 
> Insects, birds, and some mammals can see near-UV (NUV), 
> i.e., somewhat shorter wavelengths than what humans can see.
