> Rayleigh scattering ( RAY-lee) is the scattering or deflection of light, 
> or other electromagnetic radiation, 
> by particles with a size much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. 
> 
> For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering medium 
> (normal dispersion regime), 
> the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength 
> (e.g., a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air). 
> The phenomenon is named after the 19th-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh 
> (John William Strutt). 
>
> Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. 
> The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, 
> causing them to move at the same frequency. 
> 
> The particle, therefore, becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light. 
> The particles may be individual atoms or molecules; 
> it can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, 
> but is most prominently seen in gases.
>
> Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in Earth's atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation, 
> which is the reason for the blue color of the daytime and twilight sky, 
> as well as the yellowish to reddish hue of the low Sun. 
> Sunlight is also subject to [[Raman_Scattering]], 
> which changes the rotational state of the molecules and gives rise to polarization effects.
>
> Scattering by particles with a size comparable to, 
> or larger than, the wavelength of the light is typically treated by the [[Mie_Scattering]], 
> the discrete dipole approximation and other computational techniques. 
> 
> Rayleigh scattering applies to particles that are small with respect to wavelengths of light, 
> and that are optically "soft" (i.e., with a refractive index close to 1). 
> Anomalous diffraction theory applies to optically soft but larger particles.
