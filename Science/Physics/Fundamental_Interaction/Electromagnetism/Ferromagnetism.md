> **Ferromagnetism** is a property of certain materials (such as iron) 
> that results in a significant, observable magnetic permeability, 
> and in many cases, a significant magnetic coercivity, allowing the material to form a permanent magnet. 
> 
> Ferromagnetic materials are noticeably attracted to a magnet, 
> which is a consequence of their substantial magnetic permeability. 
>
> Magnetic permeability describes the induced magnetization of a material 
> due to the presence of an external magnetic field. 
> 
> For example, this temporary magnetization inside a steel plate accounts for the plate's attraction to a magnet. 
> Whether or not that steel plate then acquires permanent magnetization 
> depends on both the strength of the applied field and on the coercivity of that particular piece of steel 
> (which varies with the steel's chemical composition and any heat treatment it may have undergone).
>
> In physics, multiple types of material magnetism have been distinguished. 
> Ferromagnetism (along with the similar effect ferrimagnetism) is the strongest type 
> and is responsible for the common phenomenon of everyday magnetism. 
> A common example of a permanent magnet is a refrigerator magnet.  
> Substances respond weakly to magnetic fields by three other types of magnetismâ€”
> paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetismâ€”
> but the forces are usually so weak that they can be **detected only by lab instruments**. 
>
> Permanent magnets (materials that can be magnetized by an external magnetic field 
> and remain magnetized after the external field is removed) are either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic, 
> as are the materials that are strongly attracted to them.  
> Relatively few materials are ferromagnetic; the common ones are the metals iron, cobalt, nickel 
> and most of their alloys, and certain rare-earth metals. 
>
> Ferromagnetism is widely used in industrial applications and modern technology, 
> in electromagnetic and electromechanical devices such as electromagnets, electric motors, 
> generators, transformers, magnetic storage (including tape recorders and hard disks), 
> and nondestructive testing of ferrous materials.
>
> Ferromagnetic materials can be divided into magnetically "soft" materials (like annealed iron) 
> having low coercivity, which do not tend to stay magnetized, 
> and magnetically "hard" materials having high coercivity, which do. 
> 
> Permanent magnets are made from hard ferromagnetic materials (such as alnico) 
> and ferrimagnetic materials (such as ferrite) 
> that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacturing 
> to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them difficult to demagnetize. 
> To demagnetize a saturated magnet, a magnetic field must be applied. 
> 
> The threshold at which demagnetization occurs depends on the coercivity of the material.  
> The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment or, alternatively, its total magnetic flux. 
> The local strength of magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.
