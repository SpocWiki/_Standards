> A magnetic field (sometimes called B-field) is a physical field 
> that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. 
> 
> A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity 
> and to the magnetic field. 
> 
> A permanent magnet's magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, 
> and attracts or repels other magnets. 
> 
> In addition, a nonuniform magnetic field exerts minuscule forces on "nonmagnetic" materials 
> by three other magnetic effects: paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism, 
> although these forces are usually so small they can only be detected by laboratory equipment. 
> 
> Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, electric currents, and electric fields varying in time. 
> Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, 
> it is described mathematically by a function assigning a vector to each point of space, 
> called a vector field (more precisely, a pseudovector field).
>
> In electromagnetics, the term magnetic field is used for two distinct 
> but proportional vector fields denoted by the symbols B and H. 
> 
> In the International System of Units, the unit of B, magnetic flux density, 
> is the tesla (in SI base units: kilogram per second squared per ampere), 
> which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. 
> 
> The unit of H, magnetic field strength, is ampere per meter (A/m). 
> B and H differ in how they take the medium and/or magnetization into account. 
> 
> In vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability,   B / µ0 = H
> in a magnetized material, the quantities on each side of this equation differ 
> by the magnetization field of the material.
>
> Magnetic fields are produced either by moving electric charges 
> or the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, 
> their spin. 
> 
> Magnetic fields and electric fields are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, 
> one of the four fundamental forces of nature.
>
> Magnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, 
> particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. 
> 
> Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. 
> The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers 
> is conceptualized and investigated as magnetic circuits. 
> 
> Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. 
> The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the solar wind 
> and is important in navigation using a compass.
