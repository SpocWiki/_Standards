> An electric field (sometimes called E-field) is a physical field 
> that surrounds electrically charged particles such as electrons. 
> 
> In classical electromagnetism, the electric field of a single charge (or group of charges) 
> describes their capacity to exert attractive or repulsive forces on another charged object. 
> 
> Charged particles exert attractive forces on each other when the sign of their charges are opposite, 
> one being positive while the other is negative, 
> and repel each other when the signs of the charges are the same. 
> 
> Because these forces are exerted mutually, two charges must be present for the forces to take place. 
> These forces are described by Coulomb's law, 
> which says that the greater the magnitude of the charges, the greater the force, 
> and the greater the distance between them, the weaker the force.
>  Informally, the greater the charge of an object, the stronger its electric field. 
>  Similarly, an electric field is stronger nearer charged objects and weaker further away. 
>  
>  Electric fields originate from electric charges and time-varying electric currents. 
>  Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic field. 
>  Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature.
>
> Electric fields are important in many areas of physics, and are exploited in electrical technology. 
> For example, in atomic physics and chemistry, the interaction in the electric field 
> between the atomic nucleus and electrons is the force that holds these particles together in atoms. 
> Similarly, the interaction in the electric field between atoms 
> is the force responsible for chemical bonding that result in molecules.
>
> The electric field is defined as a vector field 
> that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge 
> exerted on an infinitesimal test charge at rest at that point. The SI unit for the electric field is the volt per meter (V/m), which is equal to the newton per coulomb (N/C).
