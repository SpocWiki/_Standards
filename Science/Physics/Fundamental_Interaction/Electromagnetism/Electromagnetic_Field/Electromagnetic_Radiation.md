> In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is a self-propagating wave  of the electromagnetic field 
> that carries momentum and radiant energy through space. 
> 
> It encompasses a broad spectrum, classified by frequency (or its inverse - wavelength), 
> ranging from radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, to gamma rays. 
> All forms of EMR travel at the speed of light in a vacuum 
> and exhibit wave–particle duality, behaving both as waves and as discrete particles called photons. 
>
> Electromagnetic radiation is produced by accelerating charged particles 
> such as from the Sun and other celestial bodies or artificially generated for various applications. 
> 
> Its interaction with matter depends on wavelength, influencing its uses in communication, medicine, industry, and scientific research. Radio waves enable broadcasting and wireless communication, infrared is used in thermal imaging, visible light is essential for vision, and higher-energy radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays, is applied in medical imaging, cancer treatment, and industrial inspection. Exposure to high-energy radiation can pose health risks, making shielding and regulation necessary in certain applications.
>
> In quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation.
