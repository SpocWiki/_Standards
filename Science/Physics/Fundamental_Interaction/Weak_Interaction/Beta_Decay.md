> In nuclear physics, beta decay (β-decay) is a type of radioactive decay 
> in which an atomic nucleus emits a beta particle (fast energetic electron or positron), 
> transforming into an isobar of that nuclide. 
> 
> For example, 
> - beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton 
>   by the emission of an electron accompanied by an antineutrino; 
> - or, conversely a proton is converted into a neutron 
>   by the emission of a positron with a neutrino in what is called positron emission. 
> 
> Neither the beta particle nor its associated (anti-)neutrino exist within the nucleus 
> prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process. 
> By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons. 
> 
> The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay 
> is determined by its nuclear binding energy. 
> The binding energies of all nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability. 
> For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible, 
> the energy release (see below) or Q value must be positive.
>
> Beta decay is a consequence of the weak force, 
> which is characterized by relatively long decay times. 
> Nucleons are composed of up quarks and down quarks, 
> and the weak force allows a quark to change its flavour by means of a virtual W boson 
> leading to creation of an electron/antineutrino or positron/neutrino pair. 
> 
> For example, a neutron, composed of two down quarks and an up quark, 
> decays to a proton composed of a down quark and two up quarks.
>
> Electron capture is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, 
> because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the weak force, is the same. 
> In electron capture, an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus, 
> transforming it into a neutron, and an electron neutrino is released.
