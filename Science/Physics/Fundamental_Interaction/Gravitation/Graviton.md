> In theories of quantum gravity, the **Graviton** is the hypothetical elementary particle 
> that mediates the force of gravitational interaction. 
> 
> There is no complete quantum field theory of gravitons 
> due to an outstanding mathematical problem with renormalization in general relativity. 
> In string theory, believed by some to be a consistent theory of quantum gravity, 
> the graviton is a massless state of a fundamental string.
>
> If it exists, the graviton is expected to be massless 
> because the gravitational force has a very long range 
> and appears to propagate at the speed of light. 
> 
> The graviton must be a spin-2 boson 
> because the source of gravitation is the stress–energy tensor, a second-order tensor 
> (compared with electromagnetism's spin-1 photon, the source of which is the four-current, 
> a first-order tensor). 
> 
> Additionally, it can be shown that any massless spin-2 field 
> would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, 
> because a massless spin-2 field would couple to the stress–energy tensor 
> in the same way gravitational interactions do. 
> 
> This result suggests that, if a massless spin-2 particle is discovered, it must be the graviton.
