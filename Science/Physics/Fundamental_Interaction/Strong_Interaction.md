## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In nuclear physics and particle physics, the **Strong interaction**, 
> also called the strong force or strong nuclear force, is a fundamental interaction 
> that confines quarks into protons, neutrons, and other hadron particles. 
> The strong interaction also binds neutrons and protons to create atomic nuclei, 
> where it is called the nuclear force.
>
> Most of the mass of a proton or neutron is the result of the strong interaction energy; 
> the individual quarks provide only about 1% of the mass of a proton. 
> At the range of 10−15 m (1 femtometer, slightly more than the radius of a nucleon), 
> the strong force is approximately 100 times as strong as electromagnetism, 
> 106 times as strong as the weak interaction, and 1038 times as strong as gravitation.
>
> In the context of atomic nuclei, the force binds protons and neutrons together 
> to form a nucleus and is called the nuclear force (or residual strong force). 
> 
> Because the force is mediated by massive, short lived mesons on this scale, 
> the residual strong interaction obeys a distance-dependent behavior between nucleons 
> that is quite different from when it is acting to bind quarks within hadrons. 
> 
> There are also differences in the binding energies of the nuclear force 
> with regard to nuclear fusion versus nuclear fission. 
> 
> Nuclear fusion accounts for most energy production in the Sun and other stars. 
> Nuclear fission allows for decay of radioactive elements and isotopes, 
> although it is often mediated by the weak interaction. 
> 
> Artificially, the energy associated with the nuclear force 
> is partially released in nuclear power and nuclear weapons, 
> both in uranium or plutonium-based fission weapons and in fusion weapons like the hydrogen bomb.
