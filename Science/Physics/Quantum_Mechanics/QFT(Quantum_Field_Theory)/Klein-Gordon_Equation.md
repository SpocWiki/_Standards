# [[Klein-Gordon_Equation]] 

The [[Klein-Gordon_Equation]] is deduced from the relativistic Relation 
E² = p²c² + m0 c² between Momentum and Energy. 
It applies only to Scalar Fields (i.e. Spin = 0). 

The [[Dirac_Equation]]  applies to Fermions. 
By Squaring it, you obtain the Klein-Gordon Equation also for Fermions.

## Derivation: 

Deriving the Momentum from the Wave-Number 
and the Energy from the Frequency you obtain: 

### relativistic Mass: $p \cdot p = (\frac{E}{c})² - \vec{p}² = (mc)²$ 

AKA the Mass-Shell, a double-Hyperboloid in p/E Space 

### Operators: $p_µ = i \hbar \partial_µ$

=> Energy-Operator: $\Large \hat{E} = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ 
=> Momentum-Operator: $\Large \hat{\vec{p}} = -i \hbar \vec\nabla$ 

### Insert Operators yields Klein-Gordon: 

The Solution to this 2nd Order ODE are again plane Waves, 
but the fact that they are 2nd Order adds a DoF that is difficult to handle. 

That is one of the Reasons [[Dirac~Paul]] "took the Square Root" of this Equation
and obtained his . 
Another Reason was that the Square of the Wave-Function yielded negative Probabilities. 

Still with some tricks you can at least derive a [[Continuity-Equation]], 
similar to [[Fluid-Dynamics]]:  $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho + \nabla \vec{j} = 0$  with a 

## Probability Density $\rho$ 

$$
\rho = \frac{i\hbar}{2mc²}\left(
  \psi^* \frac {\partial \psi  }{\partial t} 
- \psi   \frac {\partial \psi^*}{\partial t} 
\right)
$$

## Probability Flow $\vec{j}$ 

$$
j = \frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left(
  \psi   \nabla \psi^* 
- \psi^* \nabla \psi
\right)
$$
