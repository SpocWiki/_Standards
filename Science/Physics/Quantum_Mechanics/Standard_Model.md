> The **Standard Model** of particle physics is the theory 
> describing three of the four known fundamental forces 
> (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions â€“ excluding gravity) 
> in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles. 
> 
> It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, 
> through the work of many scientists worldwide, 
> with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s 
> upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. 
> 
> Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), 
> and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. 
> 
> In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties 
> of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.
>
> Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent 
> and has demonstrated some success in providing experimental predictions, 
> it leaves some physical phenomena unexplained 
> and so falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. 
> 
> For example, it does not fully explain why there is more matter than anti-matter, 
> incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, 
> or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. 
> 
> The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle 
> that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. 
> It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.
>
> The development of the Standard Model 
> was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. 
> 
> The Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory for theorists, 
> exhibiting a wide range of phenomena, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, 
> anomalies, and non-perturbative behavior. 
> 
> It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate 
> - hypothetical particles, 
> - extra dimensions, and 
> - elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) 
> to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, 
> such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.
