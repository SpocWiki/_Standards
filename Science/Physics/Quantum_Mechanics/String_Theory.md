## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework 
> in which the point-like particles of particle physics 
> are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. 
> 
> String theory describes 
> how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. 
> 
> On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string acts like a particle, 
> with its mass, charge, and other properties 
> determined by the vibrational state of the string. 
> 
> In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string 
> corresponds to the graviton, 
> a quantum mechanical particle that carries the gravitational force. 
> Thus, string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.
>
> String theory is a broad and varied subject 
> that attempts to address a number of deep questions of fundamental physics. 
> 
> String theory has contributed a number of advances to mathematical physics, 
> which have been applied to a variety of problems in black hole physics, 
> early universe cosmology, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics, 
> and it has stimulated a number of major developments in pure mathematics. 
> 
> Because string theory potentially 
> provides a unified description of gravity and particle physics, 
> it is a candidate for a theory of everything, a self-contained mathematical model 
> that describes all fundamental forces and forms of matter. 
> 
> Despite much work on these problems, 
> it is not known to what extent string theory describes the real world 
> or how much freedom the theory allows in the choice of its details.
>
> String theory was first studied in the late 1960s 
> as a theory of the strong nuclear force, 
> before being abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics. 
> 
> Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties 
> that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics 
> made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. 
> 
> The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, 
> incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. 
> 
> It later developed into superstring theory, 
> which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and fermions. 
> 
> Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed 
> before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s 
> that they were all different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions 
> known as M-theory. 
> 
> In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship 
> called the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence 
> (AdS/CFT correspondence), 
> which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.
>
> One of the challenges of string theory is that 
> the full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. 
> 
> Another issue is that the theory is thought to 
> describe an enormous landscape of possible universes, 
> which has complicated efforts 
> to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. 
> 
> These issues have led some in the community 
> to criticize these approaches to physics, 
> and to question the value of continued research on string theory unification.
