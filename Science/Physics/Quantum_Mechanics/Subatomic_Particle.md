> In physics, a subatomic particle is a particle smaller than an atom. 
> According to the Standard Model of particle physics, 
> a subatomic particle can be either a composite particle, which is composed of other particles 
> (for example, a baryon, like a proton or a neutron, composed of three quarks; 
> or a meson, composed of two quarks), 
> or an elementary particle, which is not composed of other particles 
> (for example, quarks; or electrons, muons, and tau particles, which are called leptons). 
> 
> Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact. 
> Most force-carrying particles like photons or gluons are called bosons and, 
> although they have quanta of energy, do not have rest mass or discrete diameters 
> (other than pure energy wavelength) and are unlike the former particles that have rest mass and cannot overlap or combine which are called fermions. The W and Z bosons, however, are an exception to this rule and have relatively large rest masses at approximately 80 GeV/c2 and 90 GeV/c2 respectively.
>
> Experiments show that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale particles behave both like particles and like waves; they are occasionally called wavicles to reflect this.
>
> Another concept, the uncertainty principle, states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous position and momentum, cannot be measured exactly. 
>
> Interactions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of quanta of corresponding fundamental interactions. This blends particle physics with field theory.
>
> Even among particle physicists, the exact definition of a particle has diverse descriptions. These professional attempts at the definition of a particle include:  
>
> 
>
> A particle is a collapsed wave function
>
> A particle is an excitation of a quantum field
>
> A particle is an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group
>
> A particle is an observed thing
