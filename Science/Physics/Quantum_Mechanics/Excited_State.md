## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) 
> is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state 
> (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). 
> 
> Excitation refers to an increase in energy level above a chosen starting point, 
> usually the ground state, but sometimes an already excited state. 
> 
> The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation 
> (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).
>
> The lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: 
> spontaneous or induced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) 
> usually occurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, 
> returning the system to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state). 
> This return to a lower energy level is known as de-excitation and is the inverse of excitation.
>
> Long-lived excited states are often called metastable. 
> Long-lived nuclear isomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this.
