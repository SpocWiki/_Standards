# [[Quark]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[../../../../../WikiData/WD~Quark,6718|WD~Quark,6718]] 

- Each type of Quark has its own [[../../Antimatter/Antiparticle|Antiparticle]] with the anti-color. 
- **Quarks are never found isolated** due to **color confinement**; they only exist inside hadrons (baryons or mesons).
- A baryon is always **color-neutral**, combining three quarks of different colors.
- A meson is also color-neutral, combining a quark and an antiquark of **matching color-anticolor**.

They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.

> There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

> The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator program experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered.

## Definition of Quark Generation

The **generation of a quark** refers to its classification in terms of **mass and weak interaction properties** within the Standard Model of particle physics. Quarks are elementary particles that combine to form hadrons (e.g., protons and neutrons). They are grouped into **three generations**, each consisting of **two types (flavors)**: an “up-type” quark with charge +23e+\frac{2}{3}e+32​e and a “down-type” quark with charge −13e-\frac{1}{3}e−31​e.

### The Three Generations

| Generation | Up-type Quark | Down-type Quark | Mass Range (approx.) |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| 1st        | Up (u)        | Down (d)        | 2.2 MeV – 4.7 MeV    |
| 2nd        | Charm (c)     | Strange (s)     | 1.27 GeV – 96 MeV    |
| 3rd        | Top (t)       | Bottom (b)      | 173 GeV – 4.18 GeV   |

### Significance of Generations

The **generation number** correlates strongly with **mass and stability**:

- **1st generation** quarks (u, d) are the lightest and **stable**, forming ordinary matter
    
- **2nd generation** quarks (c, s) are heavier and **unstable**, decaying into 1st generation quarks through weak interactions
    
- **3rd generation** quarks (t, b) are **very heavy**, with the top quark decaying extremely rapidly (∼5×10−25 s\sim 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{s}∼5×10−25s)
    

### Weak Interaction and Flavor Changing

Quark generations are also crucial in **weak interactions**, where transitions between generations occur via the **CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) matrix**. These transitions are probabilistic:

- 1st ↔ 2nd generation: high probability (~97%)
    
- 2nd ↔ 3rd generation: low probability (~2–3%)
    
- 1st ↔ 3rd generation: very low probability (<0.1%)
    

### Implications

The generation concept explains why:

- Only the **1st generation quarks** are abundant in ordinary matter
    
- Higher generations are produced in **high-energy environments** such as particle accelerators or cosmic rays
    
- Quark mass hierarchy affects **particle decay rates** and **CP violation**
