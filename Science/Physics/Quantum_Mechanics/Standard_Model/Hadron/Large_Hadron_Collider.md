## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator. 
> It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008, 
> in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists, and hundreds of universities and laboratories 
> across more than 100 countries. 
> 
> It lies in a tunnel 27 kilometres (17 mi) in circumference and as deep as 175 metres (574 ft) 
> beneath the France–Switzerland border near Geneva.
>
> The first collisions were achieved in 2010 at an energy of 3.5 tera-electronvolts (TeV) per beam, 
> about four times the previous world record. 
> 
> The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC was announced in 2012. 
> Between 2013 and 2015, the LHC was shut down and upgraded; 
> after those upgrades it reached 6.5 TeV per beam (13.0 TeV total collision energy). 
> At the end of 2018, it was shut down for maintenance and further upgrades, 
> and reopened over three years later in April 2022.
>
> The collider has four crossing points where the accelerated particles collide. 
> Nine detectors, each designed to detect different phenomena, 
> are positioned around the crossing points. 
> 
> The LHC primarily collides proton beams, but it can also accelerate beams of heavy ions, 
> such as in lead–lead collisions and proton–lead collisions.
>
> The LHC's goal is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, 
> including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson, 
> searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories, 
> and studying other unresolved questions in particle physics.
