> **Exotic hadron**s are subatomic particles composed of more than three quarks and gluons, 
> unlike "well-known" hadrons such as protons, neutrons and mesons. 
> 
> By contrast, "ordinary" hadrons contain just two or three quarks. 
> Hadrons with explicit valence gluon content would also be considered exotic. 
> In theory, there is no limit on the number of quarks in a hadron, 
> as long as **the hadron's color charge is white**, or color-neutral.
>
> Consistent with ordinary hadrons, exotic hadrons are classified as being 
> - either fermions, like ordinary baryons, 
> - or bosons, like ordinary mesons. 
> According to this classification scheme, pentaquarks, containing five valence quarks, are exotic baryons, 
> while tetraquarks (four valence quarks) and hexaquarks 
> (six quarks, consisting of either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs) 
> would be considered exotic mesons. 
> 
> Tetraquark and pentaquark particles are believed to have been observed and are being investigated; 
> hexaquarks have not yet been confirmed as observed.
>
> Exotic hadrons can be searched for by looking for S-matrix poles 
> with quantum numbers forbidden to ordinary hadrons. 
> Experimental signatures for such exotic hadrons had been seen by 2003 at the latest, 
> but they remain a topic of controversy in particle physics.
>
> Jaffe and Low suggested that the exotic hadrons manifest themselves as poles of the P matrix, 
> and not of the S matrix. 
> 
> Experimental P-matrix poles are determined reliably in both the meson–meson channels 
> and nucleon–nucleon channels.
