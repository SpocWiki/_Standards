## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Higgs Boson**, sometimes called the Higgs particle, 
> is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics 
> produced by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field, one of the fields in particle physics theory. 
> 
> In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a massive scalar boson 
> that couples to (interacts with) particles whose mass arises from their interactions with the Higgs Field, 
> has zero spin, even (positive) parity, no electric charge, and no colour charge. 
> It is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately upon generation.
>
> The Higgs field is a scalar field with two neutral and two electrically charged components 
> that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. 
> Its "sombrero potential" leads it to take a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), 
> which breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction 
> and, via the Higgs mechanism, gives a rest mass to all massive elementary particles of the Standard Model, 
> including the Higgs boson itself. 
> 
> The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, 
> and for several decades was considered "the central problem in particle physics".
>
> Both the field and the boson are named after physicist Peter Higgs, 
> who in 1964, along with five other scientists in three teams, proposed the Higgs mechanism, 
> a way for some particles to acquire mass. 
> 
> All fundamental particles known at the time should be massless at very high energies, 
> but fully explaining how some particles gain mass at lower energies had been extremely difficult. 
> 
> If these ideas were correct, a particle known as a scalar boson (with certain properties) should also exist. 
> This particle was called the Higgs boson and could be used to test whether the Higgs field was the correct explanation. 
>
> After a 40-year search, a subatomic particle with the expected properties was discovered in 2012 
> by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. 
> 
> The new particle was subsequently confirmed to match the expected properties of a Higgs boson. 
> Physicists from two of the three teams, Peter Higgs and François Englert, 
> were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 for their theoretical predictions. 
> Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, 
> several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it.
>
> In the media, the Higgs boson has often been called the "God particle" 
> after the 1993 book The God Particle by Nobel Laureate Leon M. Lederman. 
> The name has been criticised by physicists, including Peter Higgs.
