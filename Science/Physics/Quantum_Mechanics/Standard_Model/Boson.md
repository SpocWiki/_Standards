> In particle physics, a **Boson** is a subatomic particle 
> whose spin quantum number has an integer value (0, 1, 2, ...). 
> 
> Bosons form one of the two fundamental classes of subatomic particle, 
> the other being fermions, which have half odd-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...). 
> 
> Every observed subatomic particle is either a boson or a fermion. 
> Paul Dirac coined the name boson to commemorate the contribution of Satyendra Nath Bose, 
> an Indian physicist.

> Some bosons are elementary particles occupying a special role in particle physics, 
> distinct from the role of fermions 
> (which are sometimes described as the constituents of "ordinary matter"). 
> 
> Certain elementary bosons (e.g. gluons) act as force carriers, 
> which give rise to forces between other particles, 
> while one (the Higgs boson) contributes to the phenomenon of mass. 
> Other bosons, such as mesons, are composite particles made up of smaller constituents.

> Outside the realm of particle physics, identical bosons behave in a characteristic manner 
> at high densities or low temperatures described by Boseâ€“Einstein statistics: for example, 
> a gas of helium-4 atoms becomes a superfluid at temperatures close to absolute zero. 
> Similarly, superconductivity arises because some quasiparticles, such as Cooper pairs, 
> behave in this characteristic manner.
