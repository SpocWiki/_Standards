> A **Neutrino** ( new-TREE-noh; denoted by the Greek letter ν) 
> is an elementary particle that interacts  via the weak interaction and gravity. 
> 
> Neutrinos are fermions, which have spin of ⁠ 1 /2⁠ħ.
> The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral 
> and its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was long thought to be zero. 
> The rest mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the 
> other known elementary particles (excluding massless particles).
>
> The weak force has a very short range, 
> the gravitational interaction is extremely weak 
> due to the very small mass of the neutrino, 
> and neutrinos do not participate in the electromagnetic interaction 
> or the strong interaction.
>
> Consequently, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded 
> and with no detectable effect.
>
> Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors:
> - electron neutrino, ν_e
> - muon neutrino, ν_μ
> - tau neutrino, ν_τ
>
> Each flavor is associated with the correspondingly named charged lepton. 
> Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, 
> it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses 
> with different values (all tiny, the smallest of which could be zero), 
> but the three masses do not uniquely correspond to the three flavors: 
> A neutrino created with a specific flavor is a specific mixture of all three mass states (a quantum superposition). 
> Similar to some other neutral particles, 
> neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight as a consequence. 
> 
> For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction 
> may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino. 
> 
> The three mass values are not yet known as of 2024, 
> but laboratory experiments and cosmological observations have determined the differences of their squares, an upper limit on their sum (< 0.120 eV/c2), and an upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino. 
>
> For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding antiparticle, 
> called an antineutrino, which also has spin of ⁠ 1 /2⁠ħ and no electric charge. 
> 
> Antineutrinos are distinguished from neutrinos 
> by having opposite-signed lepton number and weak isospin, 
> and right-handed instead of left-handed chirality. 
> 
> To conserve total lepton number (in nuclear beta decay), 
> electron neutrinos only appear together with positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, 
> whereas electron antineutrinos only appear with electrons or electron neutrinos.
>
> Neutrinos are created by various radioactive decays; 
> the following list is not exhaustive, but includes some of those processes:
> - beta decay of atomic nuclei or hadrons
> - natural nuclear reactions such as those that take place in the core of a star
> - artificial nuclear reactions in nuclear reactors, nuclear bombs, or particle accelerators
> - during a supernova
> - during the spin-down of a neutron star
> - when cosmic rays or accelerated particle beams strike atoms
>
> The majority of neutrinos which are detected about the Earth 
> are from nuclear reactions inside the Sun. 
> 
> At the surface of the Earth, the flux is about 65 billion (6.5e10) solar neutrinos, 
> per second per square centimeter. 
> 
> Neutrinos can be used for tomography of the interior of the Earth.
