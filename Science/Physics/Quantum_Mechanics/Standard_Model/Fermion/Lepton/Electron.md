> The **Electron** (e−, or β− in nuclear reactions) is a subatomic particle 
> whose electric charge is negative one elementary charge. 
> It is a fundamental particle that comprises the ordinary matter that makes up the universe, 
> along with up and down quarks.
>
> Electrons are extremely lightweight particles. 
> In atoms, an electron's matter wave forms an atomic orbital around a positively charged atomic nucleus. 
> The configuration and energy levels of an atom's electrons determine the atom's chemical properties. 
> Electrons are bound to the nucleus to different degrees. 
> 
> The outermost or valence electrons are the least tightly bound 
> and are responsible for the formation of chemical bonds between atoms to create molecules and crystals. 
> These valence electrons also facilitate all types of chemical reactions 
> by being transferred or shared between atoms. 
> The inner electron shells make up the atomic core.
>
> Electrons play a vital role in numerous physical phenomena due to their charge and mobile nature. 
> In metals, the outermost electrons are delocalised and able to move freely, 
> accounting for the high electrical and thermal conductivity of metals. 
> In semiconductors, the number of mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) 
> can be finely tuned by doping, temperature, voltage and radiation – the basis of all modern electronics.
>
> Electrons can be stripped entirely from their atoms to exist as free particles. 
> As particle beams in a vacuum, free electrons can be accelerated, 
> focused and used for applications like cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, electron beam welding, lithography and particle accelerators that generate synchrotron radiation. 
> 
> Their charge and wave–particle duality make electrons indispensable in the modern technological world.

## Size-Paradox 

Experiments show the electron is **pointlike** to at least 1e−19m, much smaller than Re​.
For a uniformly charged sphere of radius R, the electrostatic self-energy is U(R)=e²/(8πεR) 

Equating this to mc² gives Re=2.82 fm

So **if** the mass came purely from field energy, shrinking R would make U(R) exceed the rest energy. 
The paradox vanishes once you adopt modern quantum field theory:
 
 The **electron mass** is not field energy, but set by its **Higgs Yukawa coupling**, 
 with QED renormalization handling divergent self-energies.
