## Size-Paradox 

Experiments show the electron is **pointlike** to at least 1e−19m, much smaller than Re​.
For a uniformly charged sphere of radius R, the electrostatic self-energy is U(R)=e²/(8πεR) 

Equating this to mc² gives Re=2.82 fm

So **if** the mass came purely from field energy, shrinking R would make U(R) exceed the rest energy. 
The paradox vanishes once you adopt modern quantum field theory:
 
 The **electron mass** is not field energy, but set by its **Higgs Yukawa coupling**, 
 with QED renormalization handling divergent self-energies.
