> In particle physics, a **Lepton** is an elementary particle of half-integer spin (spin ⁠1/2⁠) 
> that does not undergo strong interactions. 
> 
> Two main classes of leptons exist: 
> - charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons or muons), including the electron, muon, and tauon, and 
> - neutral leptons, better known as neutrinos. 
> 
> Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles 
> such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, 
> and are consequently rarely observed.  The best known of all leptons is the electron.
>
> There are six types of leptons, known as flavours, grouped in three generations.  
> 
> The first-generation leptons, also called electronic leptons, comprise the electron (e−) and the electron neutrino (νe); 
> the second are the muonic leptons, comprising the muon (μ−) and the muon neutrino (νμ); and 
> the third are the tauonic leptons, comprising the tau (τ−) and the tau neutrino (ντ). 
> 
> Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. 
> The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos 
> through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. 
> 
> Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, 
> whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high-energy collisions 
> (such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators).
>
> Leptons have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, spin, and mass. 
> Unlike quarks, however, leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, 
> but they are subject to the other three fundamental interactions: 
> gravitation, the weak interaction, and to electromagnetism, 
> of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.
>
> For every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antilepton, 
> that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude 
> but opposite sign. 
> According to certain theories, neutrinos may be their own antiparticle. 
> It is not currently known whether this is the case.
>
> The first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in the mid-19th century 
> by several scientists and was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. 
> 
> The next lepton to be observed was the muon, discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936, 
> which was classified as a meson at the time. 
> After investigation, it was realized that 
> the muon did not have the expected properties of a meson, 
> but rather behaved like an electron, only with higher mass. 
> 
> It took until 1947 for the concept of "leptons" as a family of particles to be proposed. 
> The first neutrino, the electron neutrino, was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 
> to explain certain characteristics of beta decay. 
> It was first observed in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment 
> conducted by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. 
> 
> The muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 
> by Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger, 
> and the tau discovered between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl and his colleagues 
> from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
> The tau neutrino remained elusive until July 2000, 
> when the DONUT collaboration from Fermilab announced its discovery.
>
> Leptons are an important part of the Standard Model. 
> Electrons are one of the components of atoms, alongside protons and neutrons. 
> Exotic atoms with muons and taus instead of electrons can also be synthesized, 
> as well as lepton–antilepton particles such as positronium.
