> In quantum mechanics, the Pauli exclusion principle (German: Pauli-Ausschlussprinzip) 
> states that two or more identical particles with half-integer spins (i.e. fermions) 
> cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state within a system. 
> 
> This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli 
> in 1925 for electrons, 
> and later extended to all fermions with his spin–statistics theorem of 1940.
>
> In the case of electrons in atoms, the exclusion principle can be stated as follows: 
> in a poly-electron atom it is impossible for any two electrons 
> to have the same two values of all four of their quantum numbers, which are: 
> - n, the principal quantum number; 
> - ℓ, the azimuthal quantum number; 
> - mℓ, the magnetic quantum number; and 
> - ms, the spin quantum number. 
> For example, if two electrons reside in the same orbital, 
> then their values of n, ℓ, and mℓ are equal. 
> In that case, the two values of ms (spin) pair must be different. 
> 
> Since the only two possible values for the spin projection ms are +1/2 and −1/2, 
> it follows that one electron must have ms = +1/2 and one ms = −1/2.
>
> Particles with an integer spin (bosons) are not subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. 
> Any number of identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state, 
> such as photons produced by a laser, or atoms found in a Bose–Einstein condensate.
>
> A rigorous statement which justifies the exclusion principle is: 
> under the exchange of two identical particles, 
> the total (many-particle) wave function is **antisymmetric for fermions** 
> and **symmetric for bosons**. 
> 
> This means that if the space and spin coordinates of two identical particles 
> are interchanged, then the total wave function changes sign for fermions, 
> but does not change sign for bosons. 
> 
> So, if hypothetically two fermions were in the same state—
> for example, in the same atom in the same orbital with the same spin—
> then interchanging them would change nothing and the total wave function would be unchanged. 
> 
> However, the only way a total wave function can both change sign 
> (which is required for fermions), and also remain unchanged, 
> is that such a function must be zero everywhere, which means such a state cannot exist. 
> 
> This reasoning does not apply to bosons because the sign does not change.
