## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In particle physics a Majorana fermion or Majorana particle is a fermion that is its own antiparticle. 
> They were hypothesised by [[Ettore Majorana]] in 1937. 
> The term is sometimes used in opposition to Dirac fermion, 
> which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.
>
> With the exception of neutrinos, 
> all of the Standard Model elementary fermions are known to behave as Dirac fermions at low energy 
> (lower than the electroweak symmetry breaking temperature), and none are Majorana fermions. 
> The nature of neutrinos is not settled â€“ they may even be neither Dirac nor Majorana fermions.
>
> In condensed matter physics, quasiparticle excitations can appear like bound Majorana states. 
> However, instead of a single fundamental particle, 
> they are the collective movement of several individual particles (themselves composite) 
> which are governed by non-Abelian statistics.
