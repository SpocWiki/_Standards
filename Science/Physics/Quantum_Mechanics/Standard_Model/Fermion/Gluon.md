> A **Gluon** ( GLOO-on) is a type of massless elementary particle 
> that mediates the strong interaction between quarks, 
> acting as the exchange particle for the interaction. 
> 
> Gluons are **massless** vector bosons, thereby having a spin of 1. 
> Through the strong interaction, 
> gluons bind quarks into groups according to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), 
> forming hadrons such as protons and neutrons.
>
> Gluons carry the color charge of the strong interaction, 
> thereby participating in the strong interaction as well as mediating it. 
> Because gluons carry the color charge, 
> QCD is more difficult to analyze compared to quantum electrodynamics (QED) 
> where the photon carries no electric charge.
>
> The term was coined by Murray Gell-Mann in 1962 
> for being similar to an adhesive or glue that keeps the nucleus together. 
> Together with the quarks, these particles were referred to as partons by Richard Feynman.
