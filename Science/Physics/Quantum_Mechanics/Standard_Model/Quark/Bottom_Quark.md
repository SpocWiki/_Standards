> The bottom quark, beauty quark, or b quark, is an elementary particle of the third generation. 
> It is a heavy quark with a charge of −⁠1/3⁠ e.
>
> All quarks are described in a similar way by electroweak interaction and quantum chromodynamics, 
> but the bottom quark has exceptionally low rates of transition to lower-mass quarks. 
> The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays, 
> and is a frequent decay product of the Higgs boson.
