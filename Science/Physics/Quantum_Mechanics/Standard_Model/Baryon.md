> In particle physics, a **Baryon** is a type of composite subatomic particle 
> that contains an **odd number of valence quarks**, conventionally three. 
> 
> Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons; because baryons are composed of quarks, 
> they belong to the hadron family of particles. 
> Baryons are also classified as fermions because they have half-integer spin.
>
> The name "baryon", introduced by Abraham Pais, 
> comes from the Greek word for "heavy" (βαρύς, barýs), because, at the time of their naming, 
> most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons. 
> 
> Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon) 
> where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks. 
> 
> For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; 
> and its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, 
> is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.
>
> Baryons participate in the residual strong force, 
> which is mediated by particles known as mesons. 
> 
> The most familiar baryons are protons and neutrons, both of which contain three quarks, 
> and for this reason they are sometimes called triquarks. 
> 
> These particles make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe 
> and compose the nucleus of every atom 
> (electrons, the other major component of the atom, 
> are members of a different family of particles called leptons; 
> leptons do not interact via the strong force). 
> Exotic baryons containing five quarks, called pentaquarks, 
> have also been discovered and studied.
>
> A census of the Universe's baryons indicates that 
> - 10% of them could be found inside galaxies, 
> - 50 to 60% in the circumgalactic medium, and the remaining 
> - 30 to 40% could be located in the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).
