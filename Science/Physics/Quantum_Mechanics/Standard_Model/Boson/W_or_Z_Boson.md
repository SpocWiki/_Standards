> In particle physics, the **W and Z bosons** are vector bosons 
> that are together known as the weak bosons 
> or more generally as the intermediate vector bosons. 
> 
> These elementary particles mediate the weak interaction; 
> the respective symbols are W+, W−, and Z0. 
> 
> The W± bosons have either a positive or negative electric charge of 1 e 
> and are each other's antiparticles. 
> 
> The Z0 boson is electrically neutral and is its own antiparticle. 
> The three particles each have a spin of 1. 
> 
> The W± bosons have a magnetic moment, but the Z0 has none. 
> All three of these particles are very short-lived, with a half-life of about 3×10−25 s. 
> Their experimental discovery was 
> pivotal in establishing what is now called the Standard Model of particle physics.
>
> The W bosons are named after the weak force. 
> The physicist Steven Weinberg named the additional particle the "Z particle", 
> and later gave the explanation that it was the last additional particle needed by the model. 
> The W bosons had already been named, 
> and the Z bosons were named for having zero electric charge.
>
> The two W bosons are verified mediators of neutrino absorption and emission. 
> During these processes, the W± boson charge 
> induces electron or positron emission or absorption, thus causing nuclear transmutation.
>
> The Z boson mediates the transfer of momentum, spin and energy 
> when neutrinos scatter elastically from matter (a process which conserves charge). 
> 
> Such behavior is almost as common as inelastic neutrino interactions 
> and may be observed in bubble chambers upon irradiation with neutrino beams. 
> 
> The Z boson is not involved in the absorption or emission of electrons or positrons. 
> Whenever an electron is observed as a new free particle, 
> suddenly moving with kinetic energy, it is inferred to be 
> a result of a neutrino interacting with the electron 
> (with the momentum transfer via the Z boson) 
> since this behavior happens more often when the neutrino beam is present. 
> 
> In this process, the neutrino scatters off the electron (via exchange of a boson), 
> transferring some of the neutrino's momentum to the electron.
