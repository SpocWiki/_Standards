> Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment concerning quantum superposition. 
> 
> In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat in a closed box 
> may be considered to be simultaneously both alive and dead while it is unobserved, 
> as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. 
> 
> This experiment, viewed this way, is described as a paradox. 
> This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 
> in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg's philosophical views on quantum mechanics.
>
> In Schrödinger's original formulation, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source 
> are placed in a sealed box. 
> 
> If an internal radiation monitor such as a Geiger counter detects radioactivity 
> (a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. 
> 
> If no decaying atom triggers the monitor, the cat remains alive. 
> 
> Mathematically, the wave function that describes the contents of the box 
> is a combination, or quantum superposition, of these two possibilities. 
> 
> Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, 
> not both alive and dead. 
> 
> This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends 
> and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.
>
> Although originally a critique of Bohr and Heisenberg, 
> Schrödinger's seemingly paradoxical thought experiment 
> became part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. 
> 
> It is often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, 
> particularly in situations involving the measurement problem. 
> 
> As a result, Schrödinger's cat has had enduring appeal in popular culture. 
> The experiment is not intended to be actually performed on a cat, 
> but rather as an easily understandable illustration of the behavior of atoms. 
> 
> Experiments at the atomic scale have been carried out, 
> showing that very small objects may exist as superpositions, 
> but superposing an object as large as a cat would pose considerable technical difficulties.
>
> Fundamentally, the Schrödinger's cat experiment asks 
> how long quantum superpositions last and when (or whether) they collapse. 
> 
> Different interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been proposed 
> that give different explanations for this process.
