> Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, 
> by which a physical system in a symmetric state spontaneously ends up in an asymmetric state. 
> 
> In particular, it can describe systems 
> where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, 
> but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. 
> 
> When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, 
> the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum 
> even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.
