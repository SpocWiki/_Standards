## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Tevatron** was a circular particle accelerator (active until 2011) 
> in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), 
> east of Batavia, Illinois, and was the highest energy particle collider 
> until the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was built near Geneva, Switzerland. 
> 
> The Tevatron was a synchrotron that accelerated protons and antiprotons 
> in a 6.28 km (3.90 mi) circumference ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. 
> 
> The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million 
> and significant upgrade investments were made during its active years of 1983–2011.
>
> The main achievement of the Tevatron was the discovery in 1995 of the top quark—
> the last fundamental fermion predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. 
> 
> On July 2, 2012, scientists of the CDF and DØ collider experiment teams at Fermilab 
> announced the findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions 
> produced from the Tevatron collider since 2001, 
> and found that the existence of the suspected Higgs boson was highly likely 
> with a confidence of 99.8%, later improved to over 99.9%.
>
> The Tevatron ceased operations on 30 September 2011, 
> due to budget cuts and because of the completion of the LHC,  
> which began operations in early 2010 and is far more powerful 
> (planned energies were two 7 TeV beams at the LHC compared to 1 TeV at the Tevatron). 
> 
> The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments, 
> and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.
