> Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, **Radioactivity**, radioactive disintegration, or nuclear disintegration) 
> is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. 
> 
> A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. 
> Three of the most common types of decay are alpha, beta, and gamma decay. 
> The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, 
> while the other two are governed by the electromagnetic and nuclear forces.
>
> Radioactive decay is a random process at the level of single atoms. 
> According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, 
> regardless of how long the atom has existed. 
> 
> However, for a significant number of identical atoms, 
> the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as a half-life. 
> The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range: 
> from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe.
>
> The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), 
> and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. 
> Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, 
> the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter 
> containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both). 
> When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created.
>
> There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, 
> consisting of 35 radionuclides (seven elements have two different radionuclides each) 
> that date before the time of formation of the Solar System. 
> 
> These 35 are known as primordial radionuclides. 
> Well-known examples are uranium and thorium, 
> but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes, such as potassium-40. 
> 
> Each of the heavy primordial radionuclides participates in one of the four decay chains.
