> **nuclear fusion** is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form a larger nucleus. 
> The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested 
> as either the release or absorption of energy. 
> 
> This difference in mass arises as a result of the difference in nuclear binding energy 
> between the atomic nuclei before and after the fusion reaction. 
> Nuclear fusion is the process that powers all active stars, via many reaction pathways.
>
> Fusion processes require an extremely large triple product of temperature, density, and confinement time. These conditions occur only in stellar cores, advanced nuclear weapons, and are approached in fusion power experiments.
>
> A nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than nickel-62 is generally exothermic, due to the positive gradient of the nuclear binding energy curve. The most fusible nuclei are among the lightest, especially deuterium, tritium, and helium-3. The opposite process, nuclear fission, is most energetic for very heavy nuclei, especially the actinides.
>
> Applications of fusion include fusion power, thermonuclear weapons, boosted fission weapons, neutron sources, and superheavy element production.
