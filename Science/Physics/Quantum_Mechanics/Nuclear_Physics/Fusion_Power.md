Proposed fusion reactors would use the heavy hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium for DT fusion, for which the Lawson criterion is the easiest to achieve. This produces a helium nucleus and an energetic neutron. Most designs aim to heat their fuel to around 100 million Kelvin. The necessary combination of pressure and confinement time has proven very difficult to produce. Reactors must achieve levels of breakeven well beyond net plasma power and net electricity production to be economically viable. Fusion fuel is 10 million times more energy dense than coal, but tritium is extremely rare on Earth, having a half-life of only ~12.3 years. Consequently, during the operation of envisioned fusion reactors, lithium breeding blankets are to be subjected to neutron fluxes to generate tritium to complete the fuel cycle.

> As a source of power, nuclear fusion has a number of potential advantages compared to fission. These include little high-level waste, and increased safety. One issue that affects common reactions is managing resulting neutron radiation, which over time degrades the reaction chamber, especially the first wall.

> Fusion research is dominated by magnetic confinement (MCF) and inertial confinement (ICF) approaches. MCF systems have been researched since the 1940s, initially focusing on the z-pinch, stellarator, and magnetic mirror. The tokamak has dominated MCF designs since Soviet experiments were verified in the late 1960s. ICF was developed from the 1970s, focusing on laser driving of fusion implosions. Both designs are under research at very large scales, most notably the ITER tokamak in France and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser in the United States. Researchers and private companies are also studying other designs that may offer less expensive approaches. Among these alternatives, there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion, and new variations of the stellarator.
