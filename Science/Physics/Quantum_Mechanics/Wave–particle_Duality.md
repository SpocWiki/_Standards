## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Wave–particle duality** is the concept in quantum mechanics 
> that fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons, 
> exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental circumstances. 
> 
> It expresses the inability of the classical concepts such as particle or wave 
> to fully describe the behavior of quantum objects. 
> 
> During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found to behave as a wave, 
> then later was discovered to have a particle-like behavior, 
> whereas electrons behaved like particles in early experiments, 
> then later were discovered to have wave-like behavior. 
> 
> The concept of duality arose to name these seeming contradictions.
