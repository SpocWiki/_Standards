## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Supersymmetry** is a theoretical framework in physics 
> that suggests the existence of a symmetry between 
> - particles with integer spin (bosons) and 
> - particles with half-integer spin (fermions). 
> 
> It proposes that for every known particle, 
> there exists a partner particle with different spin properties. 
> There have been multiple experiments on supersymmetry 
> that have failed to provide evidence that it exists in nature. 
> 
> If evidence is found, supersymmetry could help explain certain phenomena, 
> such as the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem in particle physics. 
>
> A supersymmetric theory is a theory 
> in which the equations for force and the equations for matter are identical. 
> 
> In theoretical and mathematical physics, any theory with this property 
> has the principle of supersymmetry (SUSY). 
> 
> Dozens of supersymmetric theories exist. 
> 
> In theory, supersymmetry is a type of spacetime symmetry 
> between two basic classes of particles: 
> - bosons, which have an integer-valued spin and follow Bose–Einstein statistics, 
> - and fermions, which have a half-integer-valued spin and follow Fermi–Dirac statistics. 
> 
> The names of bosonic partners of fermions are prefixed with s-, 
> because they are scalar particles. 
> 
> For example, if the electron existed in a supersymmetric theory, 
> then there would be a particle called a selectron (superpartner electron), 
> a bosonic partner of the electron.
>
> In supersymmetry, each particle from the class of fermions 
> would have an associated particle in the class of bosons, 
> and vice versa, known as a superpartner. 
> 
> The spin of a particle's superpartner is different by a half-integer. 
> 
> In the simplest supersymmetry theories, with perfectly "unbroken" supersymmetry, 
> each pair of superpartners would share the same mass 
> and internal quantum numbers besides spin. 
> 
> More complex supersymmetry theories have a spontaneously broken symmetry, 
> allowing superpartners to differ in mass.
>
> Supersymmetry has various applications to different areas of physics, 
> such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, optics, stochastic dynamics, astrophysics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. 
> 
> Supersymmetry has also been applied to high-energy physics, 
> where a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model 
> is a possible candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. 
> 
> However, no supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model 
> have been experimentally verified, and some physicists are saying the theory is dead.
