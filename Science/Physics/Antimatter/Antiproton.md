> The **Antiproton**, p, (pronounced p-bar) is the antiparticle of the proton. 
> Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived, 
> since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy.
>
> The existence of the antiproton with electric charge of −1 e, 
> opposite to the electric charge of +1 e of the proton, 
> was predicted by Paul Dirac in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture. 
> 
> Dirac received the Nobel Prize for his 1928 publication of his Dirac equation 
> that predicted the existence of positive and negative solutions to Einstein's energy equation E=mc² 
> and the existence of the positron, the antimatter analog of the electron, with opposite charge and spin.
>
> The antiproton was first experimentally confirmed in 1955 at the Bevatron particle accelerator 
> by University of California, Berkeley physicists Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, 
> for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
>
> In terms of valence quarks, an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark (uud). 
> The properties of the antiproton that have been measured 
> all match the corresponding properties of the proton, 
> with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment 
> that are the opposites of those in the proton, 
> which is to be expected from the antimatter equivalent of a proton. 
> 
> The questions of how matter is different from antimatter, 
> and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the Big Bang, 
> remain open problems—open, in part, due to the relative scarcity of antimatter in today's universe.
