> The **Antineutron** is the antiparticle of the neutron with symbol n. 
> It differs from the neutron only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. 
> It has the same mass as the neutron, and no net electric charge, 
> but has opposite baryon number (+1 for neutron, âˆ’1 for the antineutron). 
> This is because the antineutron is composed of antiquarks, while neutrons are composed of quarks. 
> The antineutron consists of one up antiquark and two down antiquarks.
