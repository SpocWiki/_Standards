> Length contraction is the phenomenon that a moving object's length 
> is measured to be shorter than its proper length, 
> which is the length as measured in the object's own rest frame. 
> 
> It is also known as Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction 
> (after Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald) 
> and is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. 
> 
> Length contraction is only in the direction in which the body is travelling. 
> For standard objects, this effect is negligible at everyday speeds, 
> and can be ignored for all regular purposes, 
> only becoming significant as the object approaches the speed of light relative to the observer.
