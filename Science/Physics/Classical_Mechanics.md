> **Classical mechanics** is a physical theory describing the motion of objects such as projectiles, parts of machinery, spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. The development of classical mechanics involved substantial change in the methods and philosophy of physics. The qualifier classical distinguishes this type of mechanics from physics developed after the revolutions in physics of the early 20th century, all of which revealed limitations in classical mechanics.
>
> The earliest formulation of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts based on the 17th century foundational works of Sir Isaac Newton, and the mathematical methods invented by Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Leonhard Euler and others to describe the motion of bodies under the influence of forces. Later, methods based on energy were developed by Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, William Rowan Hamilton and others, leading to the development of analytical mechanics (which includes Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics). These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extended beyond earlier works; they are, with some modification, used in all areas of modern physics.
>
> If the present state of an object that obeys the laws of classical mechanics is known, it is possible to determine how it will move in the future, and how it has moved in the past. Chaos theory shows that the long term predictions of classical mechanics are not reliable. Classical mechanics provides accurate results when studying objects that are not extremely massive and have speeds not approaching the speed of light. With objects  about the size of an atom's diameter, it becomes necessary to use quantum mechanics. To describe velocities approaching the speed of light, special relativity is needed. In cases where objects become extremely massive, general relativity becomes applicable. Some modern sources include relativistic mechanics in classical physics, as representing the field in its most developed and accurate form.

> **Mechanics** (from Ancient Greek  μηχανική (mēkhanikḗ) 'of machines') is the area of physics 
> concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. 
> Forces applied to objects may result in displacements, 
> which are changes of an object's position relative to its environment.
>
> Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, 
> in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). 
> 
> During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, 
> Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.
>
> In the 20th century the concepts of classical mechanics were challenged by new discoveries, 
> leading to fundamentally new approaches including relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics.
