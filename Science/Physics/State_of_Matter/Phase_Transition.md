## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, chemistry, and other related fields like biology, a **phase transition** (or phase change) 
> is the physical process of transition between one state of a medium and another. 
> 
> Commonly the term is used to refer to changes among the basic states of matter: 
> solid, liquid, and gas, and in rare cases, plasma. 
> 
> A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties. 
> During a phase transition of a given medium, 
> certain properties of the medium change as a result of the change of external conditions, 
> such as temperature or pressure. 
> 
> This can be a discontinuous change; 
> for example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to its boiling point, 
> resulting in an abrupt change in volume. 
> 
> The identification of the external conditions at which a transformation occurs 
> defines the phase transition point.
