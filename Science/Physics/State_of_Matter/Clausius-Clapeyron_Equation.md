> The Clausius–Clapeyron relation, in chemical thermodynamics, 
> specifies the temperature dependence of pressure, most importantly vapor pressure, 
> at a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent. 
> 
> It is named after Rudolf Clausius and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron. 
> However, this relation was in fact originally derived by Sadi Carnot 
> in his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, which was published in 1824 
> but largely ignored until it was rediscovered by Clausius, Clapeyron, and Lord Kelvin decades later.  
> 
> Kelvin said of Carnot's argument that 
> "nothing in the whole range of Natural Philosophy is more remarkable 
> than the establishment of general laws by such a process of reasoning."
>
> Kelvin and his brother James Thomson confirmed the relation experimentally in 1849–50, 
> and it was historically important 
> as a very early successful application of theoretical thermodynamics.  
> Its relevance to meteorology and climatology is 
> the increase of the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere 
> by about 7% for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) rise in temperature.
