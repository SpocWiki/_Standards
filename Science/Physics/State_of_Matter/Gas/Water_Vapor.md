> Water vapor, water vapour, or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. 
> 
> It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. 
> Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water 
> or from the sublimation of ice. 
> 
> Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere. 
> Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously 
> generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. 
> 
> It is less dense than most of the other constituents of air 
> and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds and fog.
>
> Being a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, 
> it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere, 
> where it acts as a greenhouse gas and warming feedback, 
> contributing more to total greenhouse effect 
> than non-condensable gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. 
> 
> Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important for cooking, 
> and as a major component in energy production and transport systems 
> since the Industrial Revolution.
>
> Water vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, 
> present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System 
> and many astronomical objects including natural satellites, comets and even large asteroids. 
> 
> Likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor can also be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.
>
> Water vapor, which reacts to temperature changes, is referred to as a "feedback", 
> because it amplifies the effect of forces that initially cause the warming.  
> Therefore, it is a greenhouse gas.
