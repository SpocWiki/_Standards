> A **Crystal** or crystalline solid is a solid material whose constituents (atoms, molecules, or ions) 
> are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, 
> forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. 
> 
> In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, 
> consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. 
> The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. 
> 
> The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth 
> is called crystallization or solidification.
>
> The word crystal derives from the Ancient Greek word κρύσταλλος (krustallos), meaning both "ice" and "rock crystal", from κρύος (kruos), "icy cold, frost".
>
> Examples of large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds, and table salt. Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice. A third category of solids is amorphous solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of amorphous solids include glass, wax, and many plastics.
>
> Despite the name, lead crystal, crystal glass, and related products are not crystals, but rather types of glass, i.e. amorphous solids.
>
> Crystals, or crystalline solids, are often used in pseudoscientific practices such as crystal therapy, and, along with gemstones, are sometimes associated with spellwork in Wiccan beliefs and related religious movements.
