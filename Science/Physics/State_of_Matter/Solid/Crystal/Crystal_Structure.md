## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In crystallography, crystal structure is a description of the ordered 
> arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline material. 
> Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of constituent particles 
> to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three-dimensional space in matter.
>
> The smallest group of particles in a material that constitutes this repeating pattern 
> is the unit cell of the structure. 
> The unit cell completely reflects the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal, 
> which is built up by repetitive translation of the unit cell along its principal axes. 
> The translation vectors define the nodes of the Bravais lattice.
>
> The lengths of principal axes/edges, of the unit cell and angles between them are lattice constants, also called lattice parameters or cell parameters. The symmetry properties of a crystal are described by the concept of space groups. All possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space may be described by 230 space groups.
>
> The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties, such as cleavage, electronic band structure, and optical transparency.
