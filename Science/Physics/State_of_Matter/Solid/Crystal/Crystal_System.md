> In crystallography, a **crystal system is a set of point groups** 
> (a group of geometric symmetries with at least one fixed point). 
> 
> A **lattice system is a set of Bravais lattices** (an infinite array of discrete points). 
> 
> Space groups (symmetry groups of a configuration in space) are classified 
> - into crystal systems according to their point groups, and 
> - into lattice systems according to their Bravais lattices. 
> Crystal systems that have space groups assigned to a common lattice system 
> are combined into a crystal family.
>
> The seven 3D crystal systems are triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic. Informally, two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries (though there are many exceptions).
