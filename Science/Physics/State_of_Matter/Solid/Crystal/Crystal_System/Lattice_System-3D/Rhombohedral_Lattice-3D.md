> In crystallography, the hexagonal crystal family is one of the six crystal families, 
> which includes two crystal systems (hexagonal and trigonal) 
> and two lattice systems (hexagonal and rhombohedral). 
> 
> While commonly confused, 
> the trigonal crystal system and the **rhombohedral lattice** system are not equivalent. 
> In particular, there are crystals that have trigonal symmetry 
> but belong to the hexagonal lattice (such as Î±-quartz).
>
> The hexagonal crystal family consists of the 12 point groups 
> such that at least one of their space groups has the hexagonal lattice as underlying lattice, 
> and is the union of the hexagonal crystal system and the trigonal crystal system. 
> 
> There are 52 space groups associated with it, 
> which are exactly those whose Bravais lattice is either hexagonal or rhombohedral.
