# [[Triple_Point]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[WD~Triple_point,106410]] 

There can be only a single Triple Point, because each boundary is a convex curve in the _T–p_ plane; 
three such curves can intersect only once under ordinary conditions. 
By modifying the Temperature you can obtain dynamic coexistence of solid and liquid phase. 
The (partial) Pressure of the Gas-Phase is then fully determined by this Temperature. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure 
> at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance 
> coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. 
> 
> It is that temperature and pressure 
> at which the [[../Solid/Sublimation|Sublimation]], fusion, and [[Vaporization|vapourisation]] curves meet. 
> For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of −38.8 °C (−37.8 °F) 
> and a pressure of 0.165 mPa.
>
> In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, 
> a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. 
> 
> Helium-4 is unusual in that it has no sublimation/deposition curve 
> and therefore no triple points where its solid phase meets its gas phase. 
> 
> Instead, it has 
> - a vapor-liquid-superfluid point, 
> - a solid-liquid-superfluid point, 
> - a solid-solid-liquid point, and 
> - a solid-solid-superfluid point. 
> None of these should be confused with the lambda point, which is not any kind of triple point.
