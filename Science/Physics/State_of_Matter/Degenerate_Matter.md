> Degenerate matter occurs when the Pauli exclusion principle significantly alters a state of matter at low temperature. 
> The term is used in astrophysics to refer to dense stellar objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, 
> where thermal pressure alone is not enough to prevent gravitational collapse. 
> The term also applies to metals in the Fermi gas approximation.
>
> Degenerate matter is usually modelled as an ideal Fermi gas, an ensemble of non-interacting fermions. 
> In a quantum mechanical description, particles limited to a finite volume 
> may take only a discrete set of energies, called quantum states. 
> 
> The Pauli exclusion principle prevents identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. 
> At lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible), 
> all the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy. 
> This degeneracy pressure remains non-zero even at absolute zero temperature. 
> Adding particles or reducing the volume forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states. 
> In this situation, a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure. 
> The key feature is that this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature 
> but only on the density of the fermions. 
> Degeneracy pressure keeps dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star.
>
> A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities close to the speed of light 
> (particle kinetic energy larger than its rest mass energy) is called relativistic degenerate matter.
>
> The concept of degenerate stars, stellar objects composed of degenerate matter, 
> was originally developed in a joint effort between Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler and Arthur Milne.
