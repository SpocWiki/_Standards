> The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a substance is the temperature 
> at which it changes state from solid to liquid. 
> At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. 
> The melting point of a substance depends on pressure 
> and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.
>
> When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the "characteristic freezing point" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always "the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point."
