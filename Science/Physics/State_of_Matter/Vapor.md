> In physics, a **Vapor** (American English) or vapour (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences) 
> is a substance in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical temperature, 
> which means that the vapor can be condensed to a liquid by increasing the pressure on it 
> without reducing the temperature of the vapor. 
> 
> A vapor is different from an aerosol. 
> An aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid, or both within a gas.
>
> For example, water has a critical temperature of 647 K (374 °C; 705 °F), 
> which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist at any pressure. 
> In the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures gaseous water (known as water vapor) 
> will condense into a liquid if its partial pressure is increased sufficiently.
>
> A vapor may co-exist with a liquid (or a solid). 
> When this is true, the two phases will be in equilibrium, 
> and the gas-partial pressure will be equal to the equilibrium [[../Thermodynamics/Vapor_Pressure|Vapor_Pressure]] of the liquid (or solid).
