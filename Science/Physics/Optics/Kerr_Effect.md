> The Kerr effect, also called the quadratic electro-optic (QEO) effect, 
> is a change in the refractive index of a material in response to an applied electric field. 
> 
> The Kerr effect is distinct from the Pockels effect in that the induced index change for the Kerr effect 
> is directly proportional to the square of the electric field instead of varying linearly with it. 
> 
> All materials show a Kerr effect, but certain liquids display it more strongly than others. 
> The Kerr effect was discovered in 1875 by Scottish physicist John Kerr.
>
> Two special cases of the Kerr effect are normally considered, these being 
> - the Kerr electro-optic effect, or DC Kerr effect, and 
> - the optical Kerr effect, or AC Kerr effect.
