> A **Polarizer** or polariser is an optical filter 
> that lets light waves of a specific polarization pass through 
> while blocking light waves of other polarizations. 
> 
> It can filter a beam of light of undefined or mixed polarization 
> into a beam of well-defined polarization, known as polarized light. 
> 
> Polarizers are used in many optical techniques and instruments. 
> Polarizers find applications in photography and LCD technology. 
> In photography, a polarizing filter can be used to filter out reflections.
>
> The common types of polarizers are linear polarizers and circular polarizers. 
> Polarizers can also be made for other types of electromagnetic waves besides visible light, 
> such as radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.
