> Electric power distribution is the final stage in the delivery of electricity. 
> 
> Electricity is carried from the transmission system to individual consumers. 
> 
> Distribution substations connect to the transmission system 
> and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 33 kV with the use of transformers. 
> 
> Primary distribution lines carry this medium voltage power 
> to distribution transformers located near the customer's premises. 
> 
> Distribution transformers again lower the voltage 
> to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment and household appliances. 
> 
> Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through secondary distribution lines. 
> Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. 
> 
> Customers demanding a much larger amount of power 
> may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.
>
> The transition from transmission to distribution happens in a power substation, which has the following functions:
> - Circuit breakers and switches enable the substation to be disconnected from the transmission grid or for distribution lines to be disconnected.
> - Transformers step down transmission voltages, 35 kV or more, down to primary distribution voltages. These are medium voltage circuits, usually 600–35000 V.
> 
> From the transformer, power goes to the busbar that can split the distribution power off in multiple directions. 
> The bus distributes power to distribution lines, which fan out to customers.
>
> Urban distribution is mainly underground, sometimes in common utility ducts. 
> Rural distribution is mostly above ground with utility poles, and suburban distribution is a mix.
>
> Closer to the customer, a distribution transformer 
> steps the primary distribution power down to a low-voltage secondary circuit, 
> usually 120/240 V in the US for residential customers. 
> 
> The power comes to the customer via a service drop and an electricity meter. 
> The final circuit in an urban system may be less than 15 metres (50 ft) 
> but may be over 91 metres (300 ft) for a rural customer.
