> **Capacitance** is the ability of an object to store electric charge. 
> It is measured by the change in charge in response to a difference in electric potential, 
> expressed as the ratio of those quantities. 
> 
> Commonly recognized are two closely related notions of capacitance: 
> self capacitance and mutual capacitance. 
> An object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance, 
> for which the electric potential is measured between the object and ground. 
> Mutual capacitance is measured between two components, 
> and is particularly important in the operation of the capacitor, 
> an elementary **linear electronic component** designed to add capacitance to an electric circuit.
>
> The capacitance between two conductors depends only on the geometry; 
> the opposing surface area of the conductors and the distance between them; 
> and the permittivity of any dielectric material between them. 
> For many dielectric materials, the permittivity, and thus the capacitance, 
> is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.
>
> The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (symbol: F), named after the English physicist Michael Faraday. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates. The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance.
