> **Superconductivity** is a set of physical properties observed in superconductors: 
> materials where electrical resistance vanishes 
> and magnetic fields are expelled from the material. 
> 
> Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor, 
> whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered, 
> even down to near absolute zero, 
> a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature 
> below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero. 
> 
> An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire 
> can persist indefinitely with no power source.
>
> The superconductivity phenomenon was discovered in 1911 
> by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. 
> 
> Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, 
> superconductivity is a phenomenon which can only be explained by quantum mechanics. 
> 
> It is characterized by the Meissner effect, 
> the complete cancellation of the magnetic field in the interior of the superconductor 
> during its transitions into the superconducting state. 
> The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that 
> superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.
>
> In 1986, it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials 
> have a critical temperature above 35 K (−238 °C). 
> 
> It was shortly found (by Ching-Wu Chu) that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium, 
> i.e. making YBCO, raised the critical temperature to 92 K (−181 °C), 
> which was important because liquid nitrogen could then be used as a refrigerant. 
> 
> Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors. 
> 
> The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K (−196 °C) 
> and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this 
> facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.
