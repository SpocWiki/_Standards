> In electrical circuits, reactance is the opposition presented to alternating current by inductance and capacitance. 
> It's measured in Ω (Ohms). 
> 
> Along with resistance, it is one of two elements of [[Electric_Impedance]]; 
> however, while both elements involve transfer of electrical energy, 
> no dissipation of electrical energy as heat occurs in reactance; 
> instead, the reactance stores energy until a quarter-cycle later when the energy is returned to the circuit. 
> Greater reactance gives smaller current for the same applied voltage.
>
> Reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes 
> of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element.  
> 
> Like resistance, reactance is measured in ohms, 
> with positive values indicating inductive reactance and negative indicating capacitive reactance. 
> It is denoted by the symbol X 
> 
> An ideal resistor has zero reactance, 
> whereas ideal reactors have no shunt conductance and no series resistance. 
> As frequency increases, inductive reactance increases and capacitive reactance decreases.
