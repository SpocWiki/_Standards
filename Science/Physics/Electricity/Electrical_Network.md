> An electrical network is an interconnection of electrical components 
> (e.g., batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches, transistors) or a model of such an interconnection, 
> consisting of electrical elements (e.g., voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). 
> An electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. 
> Thus all circuits are networks, but not all networks are circuits 
> (although networks without a closed loop are often referred to as open circuits).
>
> A resistive network is a network containing only resistors and ideal current and voltage sources. 
> Analysis of resistive networks is less complicated than analysis of networks containing capacitors and inductors. 
> If the sources are constant (DC) sources, the result is a DC network. 
> The effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resistor networks 
> can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometrical properties.
>
> A network that contains active electronic components is known as an electronic circuit. 
> Such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools.
