> An **electronic circuit** is composed of individual electronic components, 
> such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, 
> connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow. 
> It is a type of electrical circuit. 
> 
> For a circuit to be referred to as electronic, rather than electrical, 
> generally at least one active component must be present. 
> The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: 
> signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another.
>
> Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an integrated circuit or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as doped silicon or (less commonly) gallium arsenide.
>
> An electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an analog circuit, a digital circuit, or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits). The most widely used semiconductor device in electronic circuits is the MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor).
