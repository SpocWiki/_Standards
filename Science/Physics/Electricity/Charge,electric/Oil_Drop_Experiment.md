> The oil drop experiment was performed by Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in 1909 
> to measure the elementary electric charge (the charge of the electron). 
> The experiment took place in the Ryerson Physical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. 
> Millikan received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923.
>
> The experiment observed tiny electrically charged droplets of oil 
> located between two parallel metal surfaces, forming the plates of a capacitor. 
> The plates were oriented horizontally, with one plate above the other. 
> A mist of atomized oil drops was introduced through a small hole in the top plate; 
> some would be ionized naturally.
>
> First, with zero applied electric field, the velocity of a falling droplet was measured. 
> At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the gravitational force. 
> As both forces depend on the radius in different ways, the radius of the droplet, 
> and therefore the mass and gravitational force, could be determined (using the known density of the oil).  
> 
> Next, a voltage inducing an electric field was applied between the plates 
> and adjusted until the drops were suspended in mechanical equilibrium, 
> indicating that the electrical force and the gravitational force were in balance. 
> 
> Using the known electric field, Millikan and Fletcher could determine the charge on the oil droplet. 
> By repeating the experiment for many droplets, 
> they confirmed that the charges were all small integer multiples of a certain base value, 
> which was found to be 1.5924(17)e-19 C, 
> about 0.6% difference from the currently accepted value of 1.602176634e-19 C. 
> They proposed that this was the magnitude of the negative charge of a single electron.
