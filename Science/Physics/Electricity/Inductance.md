> **Inductance** is the tendency of an electrical conductor 
> to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. 
> 
> The electric current produces a magnetic field around the conductor. 
> The magnetic field strength depends on the magnitude of the electric current, 
> and therefore follows any changes in the magnitude of the current. 
> 
> From Faraday's law of induction, any change in magnetic field through a circuit 
> induces an electromotive force (EMF) (voltage) in the conductors, 
> a process known as electromagnetic induction. 
> This induced voltage created by the changing current 
> has the effect of opposing the change in current. 
> This is stated by Lenz's law, and the voltage is called back EMF.
>
> Inductance is defined as the ratio of the induced voltage 
> to the rate of change of current causing it. 
> 
> It is a proportionality constant that depends on the geometry of circuit conductors 
> (e.g., cross-section area and length) 
> and the magnetic permeability of the conductor and nearby materials.  
> An electronic component designed to add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor.  
> It typically consists of a coil or helix of wire.
>
> The term inductance was coined by Oliver Heaviside in May 1884, 
> as a convenient way to refer to "coefficient of self-induction". 
> It is customary to use the symbol L for inductance, in honour of the physicist Heinrich Lenz. 
> 
> In the SI system, the unit of inductance is the henry (H), 
> which is the amount of inductance that causes a voltage of one volt, 
> when the current is changing at a rate of one ampere per second. 
> 
> The unit is named for Joseph Henry, who discovered inductance independently of Faraday.
