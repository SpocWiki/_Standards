> **Electrostatics** is a branch of physics 
> that studies slow-moving or stationary electric charges on macroscopic objects 
> where quantum effects can be neglected. 
> 
> Under these circumstances the electric field, electric potential, 
> and the charge density are related **without complications from magnetic effects**.
>
> Since classical times, it has been known that some materials, 
> such as amber, attract lightweight particles after rubbing. 
> 
> The Greek word ḗlektron (ἤλεκτρον), meaning 'amber', was thus the root of the word electricity. 
> Electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces 
> that electric charges exert on each other. 
> Such forces are described by Coulomb's law.
>
> There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, 
> from those as simple as the attraction of plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package, 
> to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, 
> the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier and laser printer operation.
