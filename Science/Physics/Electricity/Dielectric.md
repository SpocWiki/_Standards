> In electromagnetism, a **Dielectric** (or dielectric medium) 
> is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by an applied electric field. 
> 
> When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, 
> electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, 
> because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, 
> but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, 
> causing dielectric polarisation. 
> 
> Because of dielectric polarisation, positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field 
> and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field. 
> This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. 
> If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarised, 
> but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.
>
> The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials. Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in electronics, optics, solid-state physics and cell biophysics.
