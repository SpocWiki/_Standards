> A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. 
> 
> The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source 
> to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. 
> 
> As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. 
> Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, 
> while others are built into the load appliances that they power. 
> 
> Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. 
> 
> Other functions that power supplies may perform include 
> - limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, 
> - shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, 
> - power conditioning to 
> 	- prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, 
> 	- power-factor correction, and 
> 	- storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power (uninterruptible power supply).
>
> All power supplies have a power input connection, 
> which receives energy in the form of electric current from a source, 
> and one or more power output or power rail connections that deliver current to the load. 
> 
> The source power may come from the electric power grid, such as an electrical outlet, 
> energy storage devices such as batteries or fuel cells, generators or alternators, 
> solar power converters, or another power supply. 
> 
> The input and output are usually hardwired circuit connections, 
> though some power supplies employ wireless energy transfer 
> to power their loads without wired connections. 
> 
> Some power supplies have other types of inputs and outputs as well, 
> for functions such as external monitoring and control.
