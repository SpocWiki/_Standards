> Components of an electrical circuit are electrically connected 
> if an electric current can run between them through an electrical conductor. 
> 
> An electrical connector is an electromechanical device 
> used to create an electrical connection between parts of an electrical circuit, 
> or between different electrical circuits, thereby joining them into a larger circuit.
>
> The connection may be removable (as for portable equipment), 
> require a tool for assembly and removal, 
> or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points. 
> 
> An adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors. 
> Most electrical connectors have a gender â€“ i.e. the male component, called a plug, 
> connects to the female component, or socket.
>
> Thousands of configurations of connectors are manufactured for power, data, and audiovisual applications. 
> Electrical connectors can be divided into four basic categories, differentiated by their function:
> - inline or cable connectors permanently attached to a cable, so it can be plugged into another terminal (either a stationary instrument or another cable)
> - Chassis or panel connectors permanently attached to a piece of equipment so users can connect a cable to a stationary device
> - PCB mount connectors soldered to a printed circuit board, providing a point for cable or wire attachment. (e.g. pin headers, screw terminals, board-to-board connectors)
> - Splice or butt connectors (primarily insulation displacement connectors) that permanently join two lengths of wire or cable
>
> In computing, electrical connectors are considered a physical interface 
> and constitute part of the physical layer in the OSI model of networking.
