> In electrical engineering, a switch is an electrical component 
> that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, 
> interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another. 
> 
> The most common type of switch is an electromechanical device 
> consisting of one or more sets of movable electrical contacts connected to external circuits. 
> When a pair of contacts is touching, current can pass between them, 
> while when the contacts are separated no current can flow.
>
> Switches are made in many different configurations; they may have multiple sets of contacts controlled by the same knob or actuator, and the contacts may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. A switch may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, or may function as a sensing element to sense the position of a machine part, liquid level, pressure, or temperature, such as a thermostat. Many specialized forms exist, such as the toggle switch, rotary switch, mercury switch, push-button switch, reversing switch, relay, and circuit breaker. A common use is control of lighting, where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures. Switches in high-powered circuits must have special construction to prevent destructive arcing when they are opened.
