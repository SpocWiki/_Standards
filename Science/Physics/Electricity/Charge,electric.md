# [[Charge,electric]]  

The SI-Unit for Charge is the [[../../../Dimension/Unit_of_Measurement/SI-Unit/derived_Unit/Unit~Coulomb]].  
Since 2019 the Charge is defined as exactly 1 Electron Charge every 1.602176634×10[^−19]s .

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Electric Charge** (symbol q, sometimes Q) is a physical property of matter 
> that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. 
> Electric charge can be positive or negative. 
> 
> Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. 
> An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral. 
> Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, 
> and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of quantum effects.
>
> In an isolated system, the total charge stays the same - 
> the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge does not change over time. 
> Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles. 
> In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by electrons, 
> and positive charge is carried by the protons in the nuclei of atoms. 
> 
> If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, 
> if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. 
> 
> Charge is quantized: it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the elementary charge, e, 
> about 1.602×10−19 C, which is the smallest charge that can exist freely.  
> 
> Particles called quarks have smaller charges, multiples of ⁠1/3⁠e, 
> but they are found only combined in particles that have a charge that is an integer multiple of e. 
> In the Standard Model, charge is an absolutely conserved quantum number. 
> The proton has a charge of +e, and the electron has a charge of −e.
>
> Today, a negative charge is defined as the charge carried by an electron and a positive charge is that carried by a proton. Before these particles were discovered, a positive charge was defined by Benjamin Franklin as the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with a silk cloth.
>
> Electric charges produce electric fields. A moving charge also produces a magnetic field. The interaction of electric charges with an electromagnetic field (a combination of an electric and a magnetic field) is the source of the electromagnetic (or Lorentz) force, which is one of the four fundamental interactions in physics. The study of photon-mediated interactions among charged particles is called quantum electrodynamics.
>
> The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C) named after French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. In electrical engineering it is also common to use the ampere-hour (A⋅h). In physics and chemistry it is common to use the elementary charge (e) as a unit. Chemistry also uses the Faraday constant, which is the charge of one mole of elementary charges.
