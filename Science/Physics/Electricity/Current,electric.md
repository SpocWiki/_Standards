There are many Units for Current, but the SI-Unit is the [[../../../Dimension/Unit/SI-Unit/Unit~Ampere|Unit~Ampere]]. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An electric current is a flow of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, 
> moving through an electrical conductor or space. 
> 
> It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface. 
> The moving particles are called charge carriers, 
> which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor.  
> 
> In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. 
> In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. 
> In an electrolyte the charge carriers are ions, while in plasma, an ionized gas, they are ions and electrons.
>
> In the International System of Units (SI), electric current is expressed in units of ampere 
> (sometimes called an "amp", symbol A), which is equivalent to one coulomb per second. 
> The ampere is an SI base unit and electric current 
> is a base quantity in the International System of Quantities (ISQ). 
> Electric current is also known as amperage and is measured using a device called an ammeter.
>
> Electric currents create magnetic fields, 
> which are used in motors, generators, inductors, and transformers. 
> In ordinary conductors, they cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. 
> Time-varying currents emit electromagnetic waves, 
> which are used in telecommunications to broadcast information.
