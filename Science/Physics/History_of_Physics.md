## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Physics is a branch of science in which the primary objects of study are matter and energy. 
> These topics were discussed across many cultures in ancient times by philosophers, 
> but they had no means to distinguish causes of natural phenomena from superstitions.
>
> The Scientific Revolution of the 17th century, especially the discovery of the law of gravity, began a process of knowledge accumulation and specialization that gave rise to the field of physics.
>
> Mathematical advances of the 18th century gave rise to classical mechanics, and the increased used of the experimental method led to new understanding of thermodynamics.
>
> In the 19th century, the basic laws of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics were discovered.
>
> At the beginning of the 20th century, physics was transformed by the discoveries of quantum mechanics, relativity, and atomic theory.
>
> Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics and modern physics.
