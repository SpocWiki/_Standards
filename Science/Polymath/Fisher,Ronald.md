> Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher  (17 February 1890 – 29 July 1962) was a British polymath 
> who was active as a mathematician, statistician, biologist, geneticist, and academic. 
> 
> He has been described as "a genius who almost single-handedly 
> created the foundations for modern statistical science" 
> and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics". 
> 
> In genetics, Fisher was the one to most comprehensively 
> combine the ideas of Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin, 
> as his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; 
> this contributed to the revival of Darwinism 
> in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis. 
> 
> For his contributions to biology, 
> Richard Dawkins declared Fisher to be the greatest of Darwin's successors. 
> He is also considered one of the founding fathers of Neo-Darwinism. 
> 
> According to statistician Jeffrey T. Leek, 
> Fisher is the most influential scientist of all time 
> on the basis of the number of citations of his contributions.
>
> From 1919, he worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station for 14 years; 
> there, he analyzed its immense body of data from crop experiments since the 1840s, 
> and developed the analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
> 
> He established his reputation there in the following years as a biostatistician. 
> Fisher also made fundamental contributions to multivariate statistics.
>
> Fisher founded quantitative genetics, and, together with J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, 
> is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics. 
> 
> Fisher outlined Fisher's principle, the Fisherian runaway, the sexy son hypothesis theories of sexual selection, parental investment, and also pioneered linkage analysis and gene mapping. On the other hand, as the founder of modern statistics, Fisher made countless contributions, including creating the modern method of maximum likelihood and deriving the properties of maximum likelihood estimators, fiducial inference, the derivation of various sampling distributions, founding the principles of the design of experiments, and much more. Fisher's famous 1921 paper alone has been described as "arguably the most influential article" on mathematical statistics in the twentieth century, and equivalent to "Darwin on evolutionary biology, Gauss on number theory, Kolmogorov on probability, and Adam Smith on economics", and is credited with completely revolutionizing statistics. For his influence and numerous fundamental contributions, he has been described as "the most original evolutionary biologist of the twentieth century" and as "the greatest statistician of all time". His work is further credited with later initiating the Human Genome Project. Fisher also contributed to the understanding of human blood groups.
>
> Fisher has also been praised as a pioneer of the Information Age. His work on a mathematical theory of information ran parallel to the work of Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, though based on statistical theory. A concept to have come out of his work is that of Fisher information. He also had ideas about social sciences, which have been described as a "foundation for evolutionary social sciences".
>
> Fisher held strong views on race and eugenics, insisting on racial differences. Although he was clearly a eugenicist, there is some debate as to whether Fisher supported scientific racism (see § Views on race). He was the Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London and editor of the Annals of Eugenics.
