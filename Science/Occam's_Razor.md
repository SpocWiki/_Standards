## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In philosophy, Occam's razor (also spelled Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor; 
> Latin: novacula Occami) is the problem-solving principle 
> that recommends searching for explanations with the smallest possible set of elements. 
> 
> It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). 
> Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, 
> it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, 
> which translates as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity", 
> although Occam never used these exact words. 
> 
> Popularly, the principle is sometimes paraphrased as 
> "of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred."
>
> This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses 
> about the same prediction and both hypotheses have equal explanatory power, 
> one should prefer the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions, and that this is 
> **not** meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make **different** predictions. 
> 
> Similarly, in science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive heuristic 
> in the development of theoretical models 
> rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.
