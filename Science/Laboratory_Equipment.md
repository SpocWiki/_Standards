> A laboratory (UK: ; US: ; colloquially lab) is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. Laboratories are found in a variety of settings such as schools, universities, privately owned research institutions, corporate research and testing facilities, government regulatory and forensic investigation centers,  physicians' offices, clinics, hospitals, regional and national referral centers, and even occasionally personal residences.
