> A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world 
> that can be or has been repeatedly tested and has corroborating evidence 
> in accordance with the scientific method, 
> using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. 
> 
> Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an experiment. 
> In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, 
> theories are statistically evaluated through principles of abductive reasoning. 
> Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific knowledge.
>
> A scientific theory differs from a scientific fact: a fact is an observation, while a theory connects and explains multiple observations. 
> 
> Furthermore, a theory is expected to make predictions 
> which could be confirmed or refuted with additional observations. 
> 
> Stephen Jay Gould wrote that "...facts and theories are different things, 
> not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. 
> Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts."
>
> A theory differs from a scientific law in that 
> a law is an empirical description of a relationship between facts and/or other laws. 
> For example, Newton's Law of Gravity is a mathematical equation 
> that can be used to predict the attraction between bodies, 
> but it is not a theory to explain how gravity works.
>
> The meaning of the term scientific theory (often contracted to theory for brevity) 
> as used in the disciplines of science is significantly different from 
> the common vernacular usage of theory. 
> 
> In everyday speech, theory can imply an explanation 
> that represents an unsubstantiated and speculative guess, 
> whereas in a scientific context it most often refers to an explanation 
> that has already been tested and is widely accepted as valid.
>
> The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain 
> and its simplicity (see [[../Science/Occam's_Razor|Occam's_Razor]]). 
> 
> As additional scientific evidence is gathered, a scientific theory may be modified 
> or ultimately rejected if it cannot be made to fit the new findings; 
> in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then required. 
> 
> Some theories are so well-established that they are unlikely 
> ever to be fundamentally changed (for example, scientific theories such as evolution, 
> heliocentric theory, cell theory, theory of plate tectonics, germ theory of disease, etc.). 
> 
> In certain cases, a scientific theory or scientific law that fails to fit all data 
> can still be useful (due to its simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions. 
> An example is Newton's laws of motion, which are a highly accurate approximation 
> to special relativity at velocities that are small relative to the speed of light.
>
> Scientific theories are testable and make verifiable predictions. 
> They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon 
> and are used to explain and predict aspects of the physical universe 
> or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, and astronomy). 
> 
> As with other forms of scientific knowledge, 
> scientific theories are both deductive and inductive, 
> aiming for predictive and explanatory power. 
> 
> Scientists use theories to further scientific knowledge, 
> as well as to facilitate advances in technology or medicine. 
> 
> Scientific hypotheses can never be "proven" 
> because scientists are not able to fully confirm that their hypothesis is true. 
> Instead, scientists say that the study "supports" or is consistent with their hypothesis.
