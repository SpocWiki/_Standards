> A **Theory** is in general any hypothesis or set of ideas about something, 
> formed in any number of ways through any sort of reasoning for any sort of reason.
>
> When applied to intellectual or academic situations, 
> it is considered a systematic and rational form of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, 
> or the conclusions derived from such thinking. 
> 
> It involves contemplative and logical reasoning, 
> often supported by processes such as observation, experimentation, and research. 
> 
> Theories can be scientific, falling within the realm of empirical and testable knowledge, 
> or they may belong to non-scientific disciplines, such as philosophy, art, or sociology. 
> 
> In some cases, theories may exist independently of any formal discipline.
>
> In modern science, the term "theory" refers to scientific theories, 
> a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, 
> made in a way consistent with the scientific method, 
> and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science. 
> 
> Such theories are described in such a way 
> that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, 
> or empirical contradiction ("falsify") of it. 
> 
> Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, 
> in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" 
> that imply that something is unproven or speculative 
> (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word **hypothesis**). 
> 
> Scientific theories are distinguished from 
> - hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, 
> - and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.
>
> Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, 
> and are neutral concerning alternatives among values. 
> 
> A theory can be a body of knowledge, 
> which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models. 
> To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.

> The word theory or "in theory" is sometimes used outside of science to refer to something which the speaker did not experience or test before. In science, this same concept is referred to as a hypothesis, and the word "hypothetically" is used both inside and outside of science. In its usage outside of science, the word "theory" is very often contrasted to "practice" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing, which is opposed to theory. A "classical example" of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.
