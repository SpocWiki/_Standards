## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Antisemitism** or Jew-hatred is 
> hostility to, prejudice towards, or discrimination against Jews. 
> 
> A person who harbours it is called an antisemite. 
> Whether antisemitism is considered a form of racism depends on the school of thought. 
> 
> Antisemitic tendencies may be motivated primarily by 
> negative sentiment towards Jews as a people or 
> negative sentiment towards Jews with regard to Judaism. 
> 
> In the former case, usually known as racial antisemitism, 
> a person's hostility is driven by the belief that Jews constitute a distinct race 
> with inherent traits or characteristics that are repulsive or inferior to the 
> preferred traits or characteristics within that person's society. 
> 
> In the latter case, known as religious antisemitism, 
> a person's hostility is driven by their religion's perception of Jews and Judaism, 
> typically encompassing doctrines of supersession 
> that expect or demand Jews to turn away from Judaism 
> and submit to the religion presenting itself as Judaism's successor faith—
> this is a common theme within the other Abrahamic religions. 
> 
> The development of racial and religious antisemitism has historically been 
> encouraged by anti-Judaism, which is distinct from antisemitism itself.
>
> There are various ways in which antisemitism is manifested, ranging in the 
> level of severity of Jewish persecution. 
> 
> On the more subtle end, it consists of expressions of 
> hatred or discrimination against individual Jews 
> and may or may not be accompanied by violence. 
> 
> On the most extreme end, it consists of pogroms or genocide, 
> which may or may not be state-sponsored. 
> 
> Although the term "antisemitism" came into common usage only in the 19th century, 
> it is also applied to previous and later anti-Jewish incidents. 
> 
> Historically, most of the world's violent antisemitic events have taken place in Europe, 
> where modern antisemitism began to emerge from 
> antisemitism in Christian communities during the Middle Ages starting in 900 CE. 
> 
> Since the early 20th century, there has been a sharp rise in 
> antisemitic incidents across the Arab world, 
> largely due to the advent of Arab antisemitic conspiracy theories, 
> which were influenced by European antisemitic conspiracy theories.
>
> Beginning in 1879, the compound word antisemitismus was first used in print in Germany 
> as a "scientific-sounding term" for Judenhass (lit. 'Jew-hatred'), 
> and it has since been used to refer to anti-Jewish sentiment alone. 
> 
> In the 21st century, the idea that there is a variation of antisemitism known as 
> "new antisemitism" has emerged on several occasions. 
> 
> According to this view, since Israel is a Jewish state, 
> expressions of anti-Zionist positions could harbour antisemitic sentiments, 
> and criticism of Israel can serve as a vehicle for attacks against Jews in general.
