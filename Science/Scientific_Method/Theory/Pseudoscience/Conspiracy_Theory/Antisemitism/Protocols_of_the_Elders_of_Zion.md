## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Protocols of the Elders of Zion** is antisemitic propaganda purporting to detail 
> a Jewish plot for global domination. 
> 
> Largely plagiarized from several earlier sources, 
> it was first published in Imperial Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, 
> and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. 
> It played a key part in popularizing belief in an international Jewish conspiracy.
>
> The text was exposed as fraudulent by the British newspaper The Times in 1921 and by the German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung in 1924. Beginning in 1933, distillations of the work were assigned by some German teachers, as if they were factual, to be read by German schoolchildren throughout Nazi Germany. It remains widely available in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by antisemitic groups as a genuine document. It has been described as "probably the most influential work of antisemitism ever written".
