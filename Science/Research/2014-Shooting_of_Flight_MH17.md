## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a scheduled passenger flight 
> from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down 
> by Russian-backed forces with a Buk 9M38 surface-to-air missile on 17 July 2014, while flying over eastern Ukraine. 
> 
> All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. 
> Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost 
> when it was about 50 kilometres (31 mi; 27 nmi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage from the aircraft landed near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi; 22 nmi) from the border. 
> The shoot-down occurred during the war in Donbas 
> over territory controlled by Russian separatist forces in Ukraine.
> 
> The responsibility for investigation was 
> delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) 
> and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), 
> which in 2016 reported that the aircraft had been downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. The JIT found that the Buk originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, 
> fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area, 
> and that the launch system returned to Russia the following day.
> 
> The findings by the DSB and JIT were consistent with earlier claims by American and German intelligence sources and by the Ukrainian government. On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia held Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and began pursuing legal remedies in May 2018. 
> 
> The Russian government denied involvement in the shooting down of the aircraft, and its account of how the aircraft was shot down has varied over time. Coverage in Russian media has also differed from that in other countries, which initially characterised it as separatist forces shooting down a "Ukrainian Air Force An-26 transport plane" before switching to blaming Ukrainian forces for shooting down **MH17**.
> 
> On 17 November 2022, following a trial in absentia in the Netherlands, 
> two Russians and a Ukrainian separatist were found 
> guilty of murdering all 298 people on board flight MH17. 
> 
> The Dutch court also ruled that Russia was in control of the separatist forces fighting in eastern Ukraine at the time.
> 
> MH17 was Malaysia Airlines' second aircraft loss during 2014, after the disappearance of Flight 370 four months prior on 8 March. It is also the deadliest aircraft shoot-down incident to date.
