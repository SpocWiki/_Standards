> Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (English: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often referred to as simply the Principia, 
> is a book by Isaac Newton that expounds Newton's laws of motion 
> and his law of universal gravitation. 
> 
> The Principia is written in Latin and comprises three volumes, 
> and was authorized, imprimatur, by Samuel Pepys, 
> then-President of the Royal Society on 5 July 1686 and first published in 1687.
>
> The Principia is considered one of the most important works in the history of science. 
> The French mathematical physicist Alexis Clairaut assessed it in 1747: 
> "The famous book of Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics. The method followed by its illustrious author Sir Newton ... spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses." 
> The French scientist Joseph-Louis Lagrange described it as "the greatest production of the human mind". 
> French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace stated that "The Principia is pre-eminent above any other production of human genius". 
> Newton's work has also been called "the greatest scientific work in history", and 
> "the supreme expression in human thought of the mind's ability to hold the universe fixed as an object of contemplation".
>
> A more recent assessment has been that 
> while acceptance of Newton's laws was not immediate, 
> by the end of the century after publication in 1687, 
> "no one could deny that [out of the Principia] a science had emerged that, 
> at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had ever gone before 
> that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of science generally".
>
> The Principia forms a mathematical foundation for the theory of classical mechanics. 
> Among other achievements, it explains Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion, 
> which Kepler had first obtained empirically. 
> 
> In formulating his physical laws, Newton developed 
> and used mathematical methods now included in the field of calculus, 
> expressing them in the form of geometric propositions about "vanishingly small" shapes. 
> 
> In a revised conclusion to the Principia (see § General Scholium), 
> Newton emphasized the empirical nature of the work with the expression 
> Hypotheses non fingo ("I frame/feign no hypotheses").
>
> After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition, 
> Newton published two further editions, during 1713 
> with errors of the 1687 corrected, and an improved version of 1726.
