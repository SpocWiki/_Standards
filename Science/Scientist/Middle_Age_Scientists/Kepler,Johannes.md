> **Johannes Kepler** (; German: [joˈhanəs ˈkɛplɐ, -nɛs -] ; 27 December 1571 – 15 November 1630) 
> was a German astronomer, mathematician, astrologer, natural philosopher and writer on music. 
> He is a key figure in the 17th-century Scientific Revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, 
> and his books Astronomia nova, Harmonice Mundi, and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae, 
> influencing among others Isaac Newton, 
> providing one of the foundations for his theory of universal gravitation. 
> The variety and impact of his work made Kepler one of the founders and fathers of modern astronomy, 
> the scientific method, natural and modern science. 
> He has been described as the "father of science fiction" for his novel Somnium.
>
> Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, 
> where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. 
> Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague, 
> and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II 
> and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. 
> He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein.
>
> Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, being named the father of modern optics, 
> in particular for his Astronomiae pars optica. 
> He also invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, the Keplerian telescope, 
> which became the foundation of the modern refracting telescope, 
> while also improving on the telescope design  by Galileo Galilei, 
> who mentioned Kepler's discoveries in his work. 
> He is also known for postulating the Kepler conjecture.
>
> Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, 
> but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) 
> and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). 
> Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, 
> motivated by the religious conviction and belief 
> that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan 
> that is accessible through the natural light of reason. 
> 
> Kepler described his new astronomy as "celestial physics", as "an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics", 
> and as "a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens", 
> transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology 
> by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.
