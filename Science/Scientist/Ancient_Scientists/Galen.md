## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Aelius **Galen**us or Claudius Galenus (Greek: Κλαύδιος Γαληνός; September 129 – c. 216 AD), 
> often anglicized as Galen or Galen of Pergamon, 
> was a Roman and Greek physician, surgeon, and philosopher. 
> 
> Considered to be one of the most accomplished of all medical researchers of antiquity, 
> Galen influenced the development of various scientific disciplines, 
> including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and neurology, as well as philosophy and logic.
>
> The son of Aelius Nicon, a wealthy Greek architect with scholarly interests, 
> Galen received a comprehensive education 
> that prepared him for a successful career as a physician and philosopher. 
> 
> Born in the ancient city of Pergamon (present-day Bergama, Turkey), 
> Galen traveled extensively, exposing himself to a wide variety of medical theories and discoveries 
> before settling in Rome, where he served prominent members of Roman society 
> and eventually was given the position of personal physician to several emperors.
>
> Galen's understanding of anatomy and medicine 
> was principally influenced by the then-current theory of the four humors: 
> black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm, 
> as first advanced by the author of On the Nature of Man in the Hippocratic corpus. 
> 
> Galen's views dominated and influenced Western medical science for more than 1,300 years. 
> His anatomical reports were based mainly on the dissection of Barbary apes. 
> 
> However, when he discovered that their facial expressions were too much like those of humans, 
> he switched to other animals, such as pigs. 
> While dissections and vivisections on humans were practiced in Alexandria 
> by Herophilus and Erasistratus in the 3rd century BCE under Ptolemaic permission, 
> by Galen's time these proceedures were strictly forbidden in the Roman Empire. 
> 
> Consequently, Galen had to resort to the dissection and vivisection of animals, 
> particularly barbary apes and pigs, 
> as Aristotle had done centuries earlier for the study of anatomy and physiology. 
> Galen, like others, reasoned that animal anatomy had a strong conciliance with that of humans. 
> Galen would encourage his students to go look at dead gladiators 
> or bodies that washed up in order to get better acquainted with the human body.
>
> Galen's theory of the physiology of the circulatory system remained unchallenged until c. 1242, 
> when Ibn al-Nafis published his book Sharh tashrih al-qanun li' Ibn Sina 
> (Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon), 
> in which he reported his discovery of pulmonary circulation. 
> 
> His anatomical reports remained uncontested until 1543, 
> when printed descriptions and illustrations of human dissections were published 
> in the seminal work De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius, 
> where Galen's physiological theory was accommodated to these new observations.
>
> Galen saw himself as both a physician and a philosopher, 
> as he wrote in his treatise titled That the Best Physician Is Also a Philosopher. 
> 
> Galen was very interested in the debate between the rationalist and empiricist medical sects, 
> and his use of direct observation, dissection, 
> and vivisection represents a complex middle ground between the extremes of those two viewpoints. 
> 
> Many of his works have been preserved or translated from the original Greek, 
> although many were destroyed and some credited to him are believed to be spurious. 
> Although there is some debate over the date of his death, he was no younger than seventy when he died.
