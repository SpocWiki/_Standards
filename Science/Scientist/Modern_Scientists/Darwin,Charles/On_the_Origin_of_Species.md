first_line: When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub‐variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature.
last_line: There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

> On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life) 
> is a work of scientific literature by [[../Darwin,Charles|Charles Darwin]]  
> that is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. 
> It was published on 24 November 1859. 
> 
> Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory 
> that populations evolve over the course of generations 
> through a process of natural selection, 
> although Lamarckism was also included as a mechanism of lesser importance. 
> 
> The book presented a body of evidence 
> that the diversity of life arose by common descent 
> through a branching pattern of evolution. 
> 
> Darwin included evidence that he had collected on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s 
> and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.
>
> Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. 
> There was growing support for such ideas 
> among dissident anatomists and the general public, 
> but during the first half of the 19th century 
> the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, 
> while science was part of natural theology. 
> 
> Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial 
> as they conflicted with the beliefs 
> that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy 
> and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. 
> 
> The political and theological implications were intensely debated, 
> but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.
>
> The book was written for non-specialist readers 
> and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. 
> 
> Darwin was already highly regarded as a scientist, so his findings were taken seriously 
> and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. 
> 
> The debate over the book contributed to the campaign 
> by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club 
> to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. 
> 
> Within two decades, there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, 
> with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, 
> but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. 
> 
> During "the eclipse of Darwinism" from the 1880s to the 1930s, 
> various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. 
> 
> With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, 
> Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection 
> became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.
