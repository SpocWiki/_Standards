> Water resources are natural resources of water 
> that are potentially useful for humans, for example 
> as a source of drinking water supply or irrigation water. 
> 
> These resources can be either freshwater from natural sources, 
> or water produced artificially from other sources, 
> such as from reclaimed water (wastewater) or desalinated water (seawater). 
> 
> 97% of the water on Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water; 
> slightly over two-thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. 
> 
> The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, 
> with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air. 
> 
> Natural sources of fresh water include frozen water, groundwater, surface water, 
> and under river flow. 
> 
> People use water resources for agricultural, household, and industrial activities.
>
> Water resources are under threat from multiple issues. 
> There is water scarcity, water pollution, water conflict and climate change. 
> 
> Fresh water is in principle a renewable resource. 
> However, the world's supply of groundwater is steadily decreasing. 
> 
> Groundwater depletion (or overdrafting) is occurring for example in 
> Asia, South America and North America.
