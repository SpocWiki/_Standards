> **Herbicide**s, also commonly known as weed killers, 
> are substances used to control undesired plants, also known as weeds. 
> 
> Selective herbicides control specific weed species 
> while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed, 
> while non-selective herbicides ("total weed killers") kill plants indiscriminately. 
> The combined effects of herbicides, nitrogen fertilizer, and improved cultivars 
> has increased yields (per acre) of major crops by three to six times from 1900 to 2000.
>
> In the United States in 2012, about 91% of all herbicide usage was, 
> determined by weight, applied in agriculture. 
> 
> In 2012, world pesticide expenditures totaled nearly US$24.7 billion; 
> herbicides were about 44% of those sales and constituted the biggest portion, 
> followed by insecticides, fungicides, and fumigants. 
> 
> Herbicide is also used in forestry, where certain formulations have been found 
> to suppress hardwood varieties in favor of conifers after clearcutting, as well as pasture systems.
