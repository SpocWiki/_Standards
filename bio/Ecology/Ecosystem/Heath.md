> A **Heath** is a shrubland habitat found mainly on free-draining infertile, acidic soils 
> and is characterised by open, low-growing woody vegetation. 
> Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths with—
> especially in Great Britain—a cooler and damper climate.
>
> Heaths are widespread worldwide but are rapidly disappearing 
> and considered a rare habitat in Europe. 
> 
> They form extensive and highly diverse communities across Australia 
> in humid and sub-humid areas where fire regimes with recurring burning 
> are required for the maintenance of the heathlands
> 
> . Even more diverse though less widespread heath communities occur in Southern Africa. 
> Extensive heath communities can also be found in the Texas chaparral, New Caledonia, 
> central Chile, and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. 
> 
> In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is 
> also found in scattered locations across all continents, except Antarctica.
