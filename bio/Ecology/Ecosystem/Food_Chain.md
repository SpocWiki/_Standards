> A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web, often 
> - beginning with an autotroph (such as grass or algae), also called a producer, 
> - and typically ending at 
> 	- an apex predator (such as grizzly bears or killer whales), 
> 	- detritivore (such as earthworms and woodlice), or 
> 	- decomposer (such as fungi or bacteria). 
> 
> A food web is distinct from a food chain. 
> A food chain illustrates the associations between organisms 
> according to the energy sources they consume in trophic levels, 
> and the most common way to quantify them is in length: 
> the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the chain.
>
> Studies of food chains are essential to many biological studies.
>
> Stability of the food chain is crucial for survival of most species. Removing even one component from the food chain could result in extinction or significant decreases in a species' probability of surviving. Many food chains and food webs contain a keystone species, a species that could directly affect the food chain and has a significant impact on the environment. The absence of a keystone species could destroy the balance of the entire food chain.
>
> The efficiency of a food chain depends on the energy first consumed by the primary producers. This energy then moves through the trophic levels.
