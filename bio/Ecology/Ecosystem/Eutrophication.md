## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Eutrophication** is a general term describing a process in which nutrients accumulate in a body of water, 
> resulting in an increased growth of organisms that may deplete the oxygen in the water; 
> i.e. the process of too many plants growing on the surface of a river, lake, etc., 
> often because chemicals that are used to help crops grow have been carried there by rain. 
> 
> Eutrophication may occur naturally or as a result of human actions. 
> Manmade, or cultural, eutrophication occurs when sewage, industrial wastewater, fertilizer runoff, 
> and other nutrient sources are released into the environment. 
> 
> Such nutrient pollution usually causes algal blooms and bacterial growth, 
> resulting in the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water 
> and causing substantial environmental degradation. 
> 
> Many policies have been introduced to combat eutrophication, 
> including the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)'s sustainability development goals.
>
> Approaches for prevention and reversal of eutrophication include 
> minimizing point source pollution from sewage and agriculture 
> as well as other nonpoint pollution sources. 
> 
> Additionally, the introduction of bacteria and algae-inhibiting organisms 
> such as shellfish and seaweed can also help reduce nitrogen pollution, 
> which in turn controls the growth of cyanobacteria, the main source of harmful algae blooms.
