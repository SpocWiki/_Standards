> **Rainforest**s are forests characterized by a closed and continuous tree canopy, 
> moisture-dependent vegetation, the presence of epiphytes and lianas 
> and the absence of wildfire. 
> 
> Rainforests can be generally classified as tropical rainforests or temperate rainforests, 
> but other types have been described.
>
> Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species being indigenous to the rainforests. 
> There may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms 
> still undiscovered in tropical rainforests. 
> 
> Tropical rainforests have been called the "jewels of the Earth" 
> and the "world's largest pharmacy", 
> because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there.
>
> Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing 
> due to deforestation, the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere.
