> **Prairie**s are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, 
> and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, 
> and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. 
> 
> Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, 
> and the steppe of Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. 
> 
> Lands typically referred to as "prairie" (a French loan word) tend to be in North America. 
> The term encompasses the lower and mid-latitude of the area 
> referred to as the Interior Plains of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. 
> It includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, hillier land to the east. 
> 
> From west to east, generally the drier expanse of shortgrass prairie gives way to mixed grass prairie 
> and ultimately the richer and wetter soils of the tallgrass prairie.
>
> In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states, from north to south, 
> of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, 
> and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas in the west, 
> and to the east, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. 
> 
> The Palouse of Washington and the Central Valley of California are also prairies. 
> The Canadian Prairies occupy vast areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. 
> Prairies may contain various lush flora and fauna, often contain rich soil maintained by biodiversity, with a temperate climate and a varied view.
