## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Biodiversity** is the variability of life on Earth. It can be measured on various levels. 
> There is for example genetic variability, species diversity, ecosystem diversity 
> and phylogenetic diversity. 
> 
> Diversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. 
> It is greater in the tropics as a result of the warm climate 
> and high primary productivity in the region near the equator. 
> 
> Tropical forest ecosystems cover less than one-fifth of Earth's terrestrial area 
> and contain about 50% of the world's species. 
> There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity for both marine and terrestrial taxa.
>
> Since life began on Earth, six  major mass extinctions 
> and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity. 
> 
> The Phanerozoic aeon (the last 540 million years) marked a rapid growth in biodiversity 
> via the Cambrian explosion. In this period, the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared. 
> 
> The next 400 million years included repeated, massive biodiversity losses. 
> Those events have been classified as mass extinction events. 
> In the Carboniferous, rainforest collapse may have led to a great loss of plant and animal life. 
> The Permian–Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago, was the worst; 
> vertebrate recovery took 30 million years.
>
> Human activities have led to an ongoing biodiversity loss 
> and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity. 
> 
> This process is often referred to as Holocene extinction, or sixth mass extinction. 
> For example, it was estimated in 2007 that up to 30% of all species will be extinct by 2050. 
> 
> Destroying habitats for farming is a key reason why biodiversity is decreasing today. 
> Climate change also plays a role. 
> This can be seen for example in the effects of climate change on biomes. 
> 
> This anthropogenic extinction may have started toward the end of the Pleistocene, 
> as some studies suggest that the megafaunal extinction event 
> that took place around the end of the last ice age partly resulted from overhunting.
