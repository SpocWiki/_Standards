## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A well is an excavation or structure created on the earth 
> by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water. 
> 
> The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, 
> to access groundwater in underground aquifers. 
> 
> The well water is drawn up by a pump, 
> or using containers, such as buckets that are raised mechanically or by hand. 
> 
> Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well. 
> Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago 
> and historically vary in construction from a sediment of a dry watercourse 
> to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India. 
> 
> Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, 
> and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age.
>
> Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, 
> as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world. 
> 
> These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, 
> and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds. 
> 
> A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced 
> concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole. 
> 
> Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, 
> which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, 
> after which a pump is installed to collect the water. 
> 
> Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, 
> using a bit in a borehole. 
> 
> Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic. 
> Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
>
> Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells 
> completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, 
> and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath. 
> 
> A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream 
> with water percolating through the intervening material. 
> 
> The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor. 
> 
> Water may be pumped or hand drawn. 
> 
> Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources 
> and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided. 
> 
> Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water 
> and may require treatment before being potable. 
> 
> Soil salination can occur as the water table falls 
> and the surrounding soil begins to dry out. 
> 
> Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.
