> Water purification is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, 
> biological contaminants, suspended solids, and gases from water. 
> The goal is to produce water that is fit for specific purposes. 
> 
> Most water is purified and disinfected for human consumption (drinking water), 
> but water purification may also be carried out for a variety of other purposes, 
> including medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications. 
> 
> The history of water purification includes a wide variety of methods. 
> The methods used include 
> - physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and distillation; 
> - biological processes such as slow sand filters or biologically active carbon; 
> - chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination; 
> - and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light.
>
> Water purification can reduce the concentration of particulate matter including 
> suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi 
> as well as reduce the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter.
>
> The standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments 
> or by international standards. 
> These standards usually include minimum and maximum 
> concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended use of the water.
>
> A visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality. 
> 
> Simple procedures such as boiling or the use of a household point of use water filter 
> (typically with activated carbon) are not sufficient for treating 
> all possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. 
> 
> Even natural spring water—
> considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century—
> must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. 
> 
> Chemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, 
> are the only way to obtain the information necessary 
> for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.
