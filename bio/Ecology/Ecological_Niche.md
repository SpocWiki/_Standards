> In ecology, a niche is the match of a species to a specific environmental condition. 
> It describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors 
> (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, 
> and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) 
> and how it in turn alters those same factors 
> (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, 
> acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). 
> 
> "The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche 
> vary from one species to another [and] 
> the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species 
> may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts".
>
> A Grinnellian niche is determined by the habitat in which a species lives 
> and its accompanying behavioral adaptations. 
> An Eltonian niche emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment, 
> it may also change the environment and its behavior as it grows. 
> The Hutchinsonian niche uses mathematics and statistics 
> to try to explain how species coexist within a given community.
>
> The concept of ecological niche is central to ecological biogeography, 
> which focuses on spatial patterns of ecological communities.  
> 
> "Species distributions and their dynamics over time 
> result from properties of the species, environmental variation..., and interactions between the twoâ€”
> in particular the abilities of some species, especially our own, to modify their environments 
> and alter the range dynamics of many other species." 
> 
> Alteration of an ecological niche by its inhabitants is the topic of niche construction.
>
> The majority of species exist in a standard ecological niche, 
> sharing behaviors, adaptations, and functional traits similar to the other closely related species 
> within the same broad taxonomic class, but there are exceptions. 
> 
> A premier example of a non-standard niche filling species 
> is the flightless, ground-dwelling kiwi bird of New Zealand, 
> which feeds on worms and other ground creatures, and lives its life in a mammal-like niche. 
> Island biogeography can help explain island species and associated unfilled niches.
