## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Biome** is a distinct geographical region with specific climate, vegetation, and animal life. 
> It consists of a biological community 
> that has formed in response to its physical environment and regional climate. 
> In 1935, Tansley added the climatic and soil aspects to the idea, calling it ecosystem. 
> The International Biological Program (1964–74) projects popularized the concept of biome.
>
> However, in some contexts, the term biome is used in a different manner. 
> In German literature, particularly in the Walter terminology, the term is used similarly as biotope 
> (a concrete geographical unit), while the biome definition used in this article is used as an international, non-regional, terminology—irrespectively of the continent in which an area is present, it takes the same biome name—and corresponds to his "zonobiome", "orobiome" and "pedobiome" (biomes determined by climate zone, altitude or soil).
>
> In the Brazilian literature, the term 
> biome is sometimes used as a synonym of biogeographic province, 
> an area based on species composition 
> (the term floristic province being used when plant species are considered), 
> or also as synonym of the "morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain" of Ab'Sáber, 
> a geographic space with subcontinental dimensions, 
> with the predominance of similar geomorphologic and climatic characteristics, 
> and of a certain vegetation form. Both include many biomes in fact.
