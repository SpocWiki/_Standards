> In ecology, **Habitat** refers to the array of resources, biotic factors that are present in an area, 
> such as to support the survival and reproduction of a particular species. 
> 
> A species' habitat can be seen as the physical manifestation of its ecological niche. 
> Thus "habitat" is a species-specific term, 
> fundamentally different from concepts such as environment or vegetation assemblages, 
> for which the term "habitat-type" is more appropriate.
>
> The physical factors may include (for example): 
> soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity. 
> 
> Biotic factors include the availability of food and the presence or absence of predators. 
> Every species has particular habitat requirements, 
> habitat generalist species are able to thrive in a wide array of environmental conditions 
> while habitat specialist species require a very limited set of factors to survive. 
> 
> The habitat of a species is not necessarily found in a geographical area, 
> it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss; 
> a parasitic organism has as its habitat the body of its host, part of the host's body 
> (such as the digestive tract), or a single cell within the host's body.
>
> Habitat types are environmental categorizations of different environments 
> based on the characteristics of a given geographical area, particularly vegetation and climate. 
> Thus habitat types do not refer to a single species but to multiple species living in the same area. 
> 
> For example, terrestrial habitat types include forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert. 
> Fresh-water habitat types include marshes, streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds; 
> marine habitat types include salt marshes, the coast, the intertidal zone, estuaries, reefs, bays, 
> the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and submarine vents. 
>
> Habitat types may change over time. 
> Causes of change may include a violent event (such as the eruption of a volcano, 
> an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents); 
> or change may occur more gradually over millennia with alterations in the climate, 
> as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, 
> and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. 
> 
> Other changes come as a direct result of human activities, such as deforestation, 
> the plowing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland 
> and the dredging of the seabed. 
> 
> The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife – 
> through increased predation, through competition for resources 
> or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the indigenous species have no immunity.
