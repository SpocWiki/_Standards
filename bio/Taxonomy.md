## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Taxonomy** is a practice and science concerned with classification or categorization. 
> Typically, there are two parts to it: the development of an underlying scheme of classes (a taxonomy) 
> and the allocation of things to the classes (classification).
>
> Originally, taxonomy referred only to the classification of organisms on the basis of __shared characteristics__. 
> Today it also has a more general sense. 
> It may refer to the classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such work. 
> Thus a taxonomy can be used to organize species, documents, videos or anything else. 
>
> A taxonomy organizes taxonomic units known as "taxa" (singular "taxon"). Many are hierarchies.
>
> One function of a taxonomy is to help users more easily find what they are searching for. 
> This may be effected in ways that include a library classification system and a search engine taxonomy.
