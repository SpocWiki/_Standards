> The **Last universal common ancestor** (LUCA) is the hypothesized common ancestral cell 
> from which the three domains of life, the [[bio~Domain/Bacteria|Bacteria]], the [[bio~Domain/Archaea|Archaea]], and the [[bio~Domain/Eukarya|Eukarya]] originated. 
> 
> While no fossil evidence of the LUCA exists, the detailed biochemical similarity of all current life 
> (divided into the three domains) makes its existence widely accepted by biochemists. 
> 
> Its characteristics can be inferred from shared features of modern genomes. 
> These genes describe a complex life form with many co-adapted features, 
> including transcription and translation **mechanisms to convert information from DNA to mRNA to proteins**.
>
> The cell had a lipid bilayer; it possessed the genetic code 
> and [[Ribosome]]s which translated from DNA or RNA to proteins. 
> 
> Although the timing of the LUCA is not able to be definitively constrained, 
> most studies suggest that the LUCA existed by or prior to 3.5 billion years ago, 
> and possibly as early as 4.3 billion years ago or earlier. 
> The nature of this point or stage of divergence remains a topic of research.
>
> All earlier forms of life preceding this divergence 
> and all extant organisms are generally thought to share common ancestry. 
> 
> On the basis of a formal statistical test, this theory of a universal common ancestry (UCA) 
> is supported versus competing multiple-ancestry hypotheses. 
> The first universal common ancestor (FUCA) is a hypothetical non-cellular ancestor to LUCA 
> and other now-extinct sister lineages.
>
> Whether the genesis of viruses falls before or after the LUCA–
> as well as the diversity of extant viruses and their hosts–remains a subject of investigation.
