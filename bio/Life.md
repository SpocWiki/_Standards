## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> **Life** is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, 
> such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not. 
> 
> It is defined descriptively by the capacity for 
> homeostasis, organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. 
> 
> All life over time eventually reaches a state of death, and none is immortal. 
> Many philosophical definitions of living systems have been proposed, such as self-organizing systems. 
> 
> Viruses in particular make definition difficult as they replicate only in host cells. 
> Life exists all over the Earth in air, water, and soil, with many ecosystems forming the biosphere. 
> Some of these are harsh environments occupied only by extremophiles.
>
> Life has been studied since ancient times, with theories such as 
> - Empedocles's materialism asserting that it was composed of four eternal elements, and 
> - Aristotle's hylomorphism asserting that living things have souls and embody both form and matter. 
> 
> Life originated at least 3.5 billion years ago, resulting in a universal common ancestor. 
> This evolved into all the species that exist now, by way of many extinct species, 
> some of which have left traces as fossils. 
> 
> Attempts to classify living things, too, began with Aristotle. 
> Modern [[Biological_Classification]] began with Carl Linnaeus's system of binomial nomenclature in the 1740s.
>
> Living things are composed of biochemical molecules, formed mainly from a few core chemical elements. 
> All living things contain two types of large molecule, proteins and nucleic acids, 
> the latter usually both DNA and RNA: these carry the information needed by each species, 
> including the instructions to make each type of protein. 
> 
> The proteins, in turn, serve as the machinery which carries out the many chemical processes of life. 
> The cell is the structural and functional unit of life. 
> 
> Smaller organisms, including prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), consist of small single cells. 
> Larger organisms, mainly eukaryotes, can consist of single cells 
> or may be multicellular with more complex structure. 
> 
> Life is only known to exist on Earth but extraterrestrial life is thought probable. 
> Artificial life is being simulated and explored by scientists and engineers.
