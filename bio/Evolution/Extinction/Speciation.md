## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Speciation** is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. 
> The biologist Orator F. Cook coined the term in 1906 for cladogenesis, the splitting of lineages, 
> as opposed to anagenesis, phyletic evolution within lineages. 
> 
> Charles Darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation 
> in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. 
> He also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism, but found it problematic.
>
> There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, 
> based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: 
> - allopatric, 
> - peripatric, 
> - parapatric, and 
> - sympatric. 
> Whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the subject of much ongoing discussion.
>
> Rapid sympatric speciation can take place through polyploidy, such as by doubling of chromosome number; 
> the result is progeny which are immediately reproductively isolated from the parent population. 
> 
> New species can also be created through hybridization, followed by reproductive isolation, 
> if the hybrid is favoured by natural selection.

## Speciation-Rates

[Phyletic gradualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic_gradualism "Phyletic gradualism"), above, consists of relatively slow change over geological time. [Punctuated equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium "Punctuated equilibrium"), bottom, consists of [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology) "Morphology (biology)") stability and rare, relatively rapid bursts of [evolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") change.

## Punctuated Evolution Theory 

There is debate as to the rate at which speciation events occur over geologic time. 
While some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant and gradual over time 
(known as "Phyletic gradualism" – see diagram), 
some [palaeontologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology "Paleontology") such as [Niles Eldredge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Eldredge "Niles Eldredge") and [Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould "Stephen Jay Gould") have argued 
that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time, 
and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief intervals, a view known as _[punctuated equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium "Punctuated equilibrium")_.

While a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment 
by accumulating a wide range of genetic variation, 
this is to the detriment of the _individuals_ who have to carry these mutations 
until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation. 

### evolutionary stagnation 

Mutations that affect the external appearance of their carriers 
will rarely be passed on to the next and subsequent generations. 
They would therefore seldom be tested by natural selection. 

Evolution is, therefore, effectively halted or slowed down considerably. 
The only mutations that can accumulate in a population, on this punctuated equilibrium view, 
are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearers 
(i.e., they are "silent" or "[neutral mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution "Neutral theory of molecular evolution")", 
which can be, and are, used to trace the [relatedness and age of populations and species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_molecular_evolution "History of molecular evolution").
### Isolation and Pressure 

Evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided, as a result of a severe scarcity of potential mates. 
This is most likely to occur in [small, isolated communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_population_size "Small population size"). 
These occur most commonly on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, or caves, 
or during the aftermath of a [mass extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event "Extinction event").
Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted 
but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding 
cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition.

Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate 
might introduce additional genetic changes. 

### Expansion and evolutionary stagnation 

If an isolated population such as this [survives its genetic upheavals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory#Genetic_bottleneck_hypothesis "Toba catastrophe theory"), 
and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, 
or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, 
a new species, or subspecies, will have come into being. 

In geological terms, this will be an abrupt event. 
A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will thereafter result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation
