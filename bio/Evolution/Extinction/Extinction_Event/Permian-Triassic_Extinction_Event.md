> The Permian–Triassic extinction event, colloquially known as the Great Dying, 
> was an extinction event that occurred approximately 251.9 million years ago (mya), 
> at the boundary between the Permian and Triassic geologic periods, 
> and with them the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. 
> 
> It is Earth's most severe known extinction event, with the extinction of 
> - 57% of biological families, 
> - 62% of genera, 
> - 81% of marine species,  and 
> - 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. 
> It is also the greatest known mass extinction of insects. 
> 
> It is the greatest of the "Big Five" mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. 
> There is evidence for one to three distinct pulses, or phases, of extinction.
>
> The scientific consensus is that 
> the main cause of the extinction was the flood basalt volcanic eruptions 
> that created the Siberian Traps, which released sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, 
> resulting in euxinia (oxygen-starved, sulfurous oceans), elevated global temperatures,
> and acidified oceans.
>
> The level of atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from around 400 ppm to 2,500 ppm 
> with approximately 3,900 to 12,000 gigatonnes of carbon 
> being added to the ocean-atmosphere system during this period. 
>
> Several other contributing factors have been proposed, including the 
> - emission of carbon dioxide from the burning of oil and 
> - coal deposits ignited by the eruptions; 
> - emissions of methane from the gasification of methane clathrates; 
> - emissions of methane by novel methanogenic microorganisms 
>   nourished by minerals dispersed in the eruptions; 
> - longer and more intense El Niño events; and 
> - an extraterrestrial impact that created the Araguainha crater 
>   and caused seismic release of methane and 
> - the destruction of the ozone layer with increased exposure to solar radiation.
