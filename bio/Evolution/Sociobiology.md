> **Sociobiology** is a field of biology 
> that aims to explain social behavior in terms of evolution. 
> 
> It draws from disciplines including psychology, ethology, anthropology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, and population genetics. 
> Within the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely allied to 
> evolutionary anthropology, human behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, and sociology.
>
> Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as 
> mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of social insects. 
> 
> It argues that just as selection pressure 
> led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, 
> so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.
>
> While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s; 
> the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of E. O. Wilson's book 
> Sociobiology: The New Synthesis in 1975. 
> 
> The field quickly became the subject of scientific controversy. 
> 
> Critics, led by Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, argued 
> that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness 
> could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. 
> 
> Sociobiologists responded by pointing to 
> the complex relationship between nature and nurture. 
> 
> Among sociobiologists, the controversy 
> between laying weight to different levels of selection 
> was settled between D.S. Wilson and E.O. Wilson in 2007.
