> Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals 
> due to differences in the relative fitness endowed on them 
> by their own particular complement of observable characteristics. 
> 
> It is a key law or mechanism of evolution 
> which changes the heritable traits characteristic of a population or species over generations. 
> 
> Charles Darwin popularised the term "natural selection", 
> contrasting it with artificial selection, which is intentional, whereas natural selection is not. 
>
> For Darwin natural selection was a law or principle 
> which resulted from three different kinds of process: 
> - inheritance, including the transmission of heritable material from parent to offspring 
>   and its development (ontogeny) in the offspring; 
> - variation, which partly resulted from an organism's own agency (see phenotype; Baldwin effect); 
> - and the struggle for existence, which included both competition between organisms 
>   and cooperation or 'mutual aid' (particularly in 'social' plants and social animals).
>
> Variation of traits, both genotypic and phenotypic, exists within all populations of organisms. 
> However, some traits are more likely to facilitate survival and reproductive success. 
> Thus, these traits are more likely to be passed on to the next generation. 
> These traits can also become more common within a population 
> if the environment that favours these traits remains fixed. 
> 
> If new traits become more favoured due to changes in a specific niche, microevolution occurs. 
> If new traits become more favoured due to changes in the broader environment, macroevolution occurs. 
> 
> Sometimes, new species can arise, 
> especially if these new traits are radically different from the traits possessed by their predecessors.
>
> The likelihood of these traits being 'selected' and passed down are determined by many factors. 
> Some are likely to be passed down because they adapt well to their environments. 
> Others are passed down because these traits are actively preferred by mating partners, 
> which is known as sexual selection. 
> 
> Female bodies also prefer traits that confer the lowest cost to their reproductive health, 
> which is known as fecundity selection.
>
> Natural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. 
> The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace 
> in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book 
> [[On the Origin of Species]] by Means of Natural Selection, 
> or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. 
> 
> He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, 
> a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders 
> are systematically favoured for reproduction. 
> 
> The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; 
> at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. 
> 
> The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics 
> formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. 
>
> New evidence has prompted 21st century  evolutionary biologists 
> to challenge the 20th century's gene-centred view of evolution, 
> producing several  extended evolutionary syntheses 
> which bring organisms back to the heart of the theory of natural selection. 
> 
> Convergently, the growth of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, 
> which compares the developmental processes of different organisms 
> to infer how developmental processes evolved. 
> 
> While it is now recognised that genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, 
> natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.
