> **Compassion** is a social feeling that motivates people to go out of their way 
> to relieve the physical, mental, or emotional pains of others and themselves. 
> 
> Compassion is sensitivity to the emotional aspects of the suffering of others. 
> When based on notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, 
> it may be considered partially rational in nature.
>
> Compassion involves "feeling for another" and is a precursor to empathy, 
> the "feeling as another" capacity (as opposed to sympathy, the "feeling towards another"). 
> In common parlance, active compassion is the desire to alleviate another's suffering.
>
> Compassion involves allowing oneself to be moved by suffering to help alleviate and prevent it. 
> An act of compassion is one that is intended to be helpful. 
> Other virtues that harmonize with compassion include patience, 
> wisdom, kindness, perseverance, warmth, and resolve. 
> 
> It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in altruism. 
> The difference between sympathy and compassion is 
> that the former responds to others' suffering with sorrow and concern 
> whereas the latter responds with warmth and care. 
> 
> An article in Clinical Psychology Review suggests that 
> "compassion consists of three facets: noticing, feeling, and responding".
>
> In Buddhism, compassion is the heartfelt wish to relieve the suffering of all beings, 
> paired with the courage to act. 
> 
> Compassionate actions plant seeds of joy in others—and in ourselves—
> making them a true source of lasting happiness.
