> The word pride may refer to group identity. Manifestations include one's ethnicity. It is notably known for Black Pride, which gained historical momentum during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Then, it became known for independence struggles—Feminist Pride, rooted in the women's rights movement with gender equality struggles and sexual identity (for example, Gay Pride or LGBTQ Pride, rising in visibility following the Stonewall riots). In this context of minority groups, the display of pride is in defiance of people outside the minority who are attempting to instill them with a sense of shame. There is also the sense of pride that can accompany national identity (patriotism), regional identity, or other affiliations (e.g. proud to be a university alumnus). In this context, the pride is more literal.

> It may also refer to foolhardiness, or a corrupt, irrational sense of one's personal value, status, or accomplishments. In this sense, pride can be used synonymously with hubris or vanity. It is traditionally interpreted in classical theology as one of the seven deadly sins. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice, it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, or vainglory.
