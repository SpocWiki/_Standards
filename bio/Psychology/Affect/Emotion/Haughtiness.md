> Pride is a human secondary emotion characterized by 
> a sense of satisfaction with one's identity, performance, or accomplishments. 
> 
> It is often considered the opposite of shame or humility 
> and, depending on context, may be viewed as either virtue or vice. 
> Pride may refer to a feeling of satisfaction derived from one's own or another's choices and actions, or one's belonging to a group of people. Typically, pride arises from praise, independent self-reflection and/or a fulfilled feeling of belonging. 
>
> The word pride may refer to group identity. Manifestations include one's ethnicity. It is notably known for Black Pride, which gained historical momentum during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Then, it became known for independence struggles—Feminist Pride, rooted in the women's rights movement and gender equality struggles and sexual identity (for example, Gay Pride or LGBT Pride, rising in visibility following the Stonewall riots).  In this context of minority groups, the display of pride is in defiance of people outside of the minority in question trying to instill them with a sense of shame.
>
> There's also the sense of pride that can accompany national identity (patriotism), regional identity, or other affiliations (for example, proud to be a university alumnus). In this context, the pride is more literal.
>
> It may also refer to foolhardiness, or a corrupt, irrational sense of one's personal value, status, or accomplishments, and in this sense, pride can be used synonymously with hubris or vanity. In this sense it has classical theological interpretation as one of the seven deadly sins.
>
> While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride as a form of sin, as stated in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. In Catholicism, it is considered one of the seven deadly sins. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice, it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt or vainglory.
