## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, 
> a **feeling** is "a self-contained phenomenal experience"; 
> feelings are "subjective, evaluative, 
> and independent of the sensations, thoughts, or images evoking them". 
> 
> The term feeling is closely related to, but not the same as, emotion. 
> Feeling may, for instance, refer to the conscious subjective experience of emotions. The study of subjective experiences is called phenomenology. Psychotherapy generally involves a therapist helping a client understand, articulate, and learn to effectively regulate the client's own feelings, and ultimately to take responsibility for the client's experience of the world. Feelings are sometimes held to be characteristic of embodied consciousness.
>
> The English noun feelings may generally refer to any degree of subjectivity in perception or sensation. However, feelings often refer to an individual sense of well-being (perhaps of wholeness, safety, or being loved). Feelings have a semantic field extending from the individual and spiritual to the social and political. The word feeling may refer to any of a number of psychological characteristics of experience, or even to reflect the entire inner life of the individual (see mood). As self-contained phenomenal experiences, evoked by sensations and perceptions, feelings can strongly influence the character of a person's subjective reality. Feelings can sometimes harbor bias or otherwise distort veridical perception, in particular through projection, wishful thinking, among many other such effects.
>
> Feeling may also describe the senses, such as the physical sensation of touch.
