Happiness = Situation - Expectation  

Happiness is regulated by Evolution to improve Procreation. 
Therefore, permanent Changes in Happiness are minor. 
Happiness tends to take a U-Shape with a dip around the 30s, 
primarily due to Business and Childcare. 

The average Happiness varies by person 
and usually is only temporarily modified by external Events. 

Happiness is improved with a Sense of Meaning, Purpose and self-efficacy.
