> **Psychotherapy** (also psychological therapy, talk therapy, or talking therapy) 
> is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, 
> to help a person change behavior, increase happiness, and overcome problems. 
> 
> Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, 
> to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, 
> and to improve relationships and social skills. 
> 
> Numerous types of psychotherapy have been designed either for individual adults, families, 
> or children and adolescents. 
> 
> Some types of psychotherapy are considered evidence-based for treating diagnosed mental disorders; 
> other types have been criticized as pseudoscience.
>
> There are hundreds of psychotherapy techniques, some being minor variations; others are based on very different conceptions of psychology. 
> 
> Most approaches involve one-to-one sessions, between the client and therapist, 
> but some are conducted with groups, including couples and families.
>
> Psychotherapists may be mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, 
> mental health nurses, clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, 
> or licensed professional counselors. 
> 
> Psychotherapists may also come from a variety of other backgrounds, 
> and depending on the jurisdiction may be legally regulated, voluntarily regulated 
> or unregulated (and the term itself may be protected or not).
>
> It has shown general efficacy across a range of conditions, 
> although its effectiveness varies by individual and condition. 
> 
> While large-scale reviews support its benefits, 
> debates continue over the best methods for evaluating outcomes, 
> including the use of randomized controlled trials versus individualized approaches. 
> 
> A 2022 umbrella review of 102 meta-analyses found 
> that effect sizes for both psychotherapies and medications were generally small, 
> leading researchers to recommend a paradigm shift in mental health research. 
> 
> Although many forms of therapy differ in technique, they often produce similar outcomes, 
> leading to theories that common factors—such as the therapeutic relationship—
> are key drivers of effectiveness. 
> 
> Challenges include high dropout rates, limited understanding of mechanisms of change, 
> potential adverse effects, and concerns about therapist adherence to treatment fidelity. 
> 
> Critics have raised questions about psychotherapy’s scientific basis, cultural assumptions, 
> and power dynamics, while others argue it is underutilized compared to pharmacological treatments.
