## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Social psychology is the methodical study of how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors 
> are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. 
> 
> Although studying many of the same substantive topics as its counterpart in the field of sociology, psychological social psychology places more emphasis on the individual, rather than society; the influence of social structure and culture on individual outcomes, such as personality, behavior, and one's position in social hierarchies. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the relationship between mental states and social situations, studying the social conditions under which thoughts, feelings, and behaviors occur, and how these variables influence social interactions.
