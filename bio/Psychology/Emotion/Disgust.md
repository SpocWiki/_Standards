> **Disgust** (Middle French: desgouster, from Latin gustus, 'taste') is an emotional response of rejection or revulsion 
> to something potentially contagious or something considered offensive, distasteful or unpleasant. 
> 
> In The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, 
> Charles Darwin wrote that disgust is a sensation that refers to something revolting. 
> Disgust is experienced primarily in relation to the sense of taste (either perceived or imagined), 
> and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling by sense of smell, touch, or vision. 
> 
> Musically sensitive people may even be disgusted by the cacophony of inharmonious sounds. 
> Research has continually proven a relationship between disgust and anxiety disorders 
> such as arachnophobia, blood-injection-injury type phobias, 
> and contamination fear related obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (also known as OCD).
>
> Disgust is one of the basic emotions of Robert Plutchik's theory of emotions, 
> and has been studied extensively by Paul Rozin. 
> 
> It invokes a characteristic facial expression, one of Paul Ekman's six universal facial expressions of emotion. 
> Unlike the emotions of fear, anger, and sadness, disgust is associated with a decrease in heart rate 
> (for body-envelope violations)  and proto-nausea of the stomach (for bodily effluvia).
