## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Anger** is an intense emotional state involving a strong, uncomfortable 
> and non-cooperative response to a perceived provocation, hurt, or threat.
>
> A person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects, such as 
> - increased heart rate, 
> - elevated blood pressure, and 
> - increased levels of the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. 
> Some view anger as an emotion that triggers part of the fight or flight response. 
> Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically 
> when a person makes the conscious choice to take action 
> to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.
>
> Anger can have many physical and mental consequences. 
> The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times public acts of aggression. 
> Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown. 
> While most of those who experience anger 
> explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them", 
> psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken 
> because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.
>
> Modern psychologists view anger as a normal, natural, and mature emotion 
> experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as 
> an emotion that has functional value for individual survival and mutual cooperation.  
> 
> However, uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well-being 
> and may produce deleterious health effects and negatively impact those around them. 
> 
> While many philosophers and writers have 
> warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, 
> there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger. 
> 
> The issue of dealing with anger has been written about 
> since the times of the earliest philosophers, 
> but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, 
> have also pointed out the possible ill effects of suppressing anger 
> on one's well-being and interpersonal relationships.
