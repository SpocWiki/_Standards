> The Mechanical Turk, also known as the Automaton Chess Player 
> (German: Schachtürke, lit. 'chess Turk'; Hungarian: A Török), or simply The Turk, 
> was a fraudulent chess-playing machine constructed in 1770, 
> which appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent. 
> 
> For 84 years, it was exhibited on tours by various owners as an automaton. 
> The machine survived and continued giving occasional exhibitions until 1854, 
> when a fire swept through the museum where it was kept, destroying the machine. 
> 
> Afterwards, articles were published by a son of the machine's owner revealing its secrets to the public: 
> that it was an elaborate hoax, suspected by some, but never proven in public while it still existed.
> 
> Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (1734–1804) 
> to impress Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, 
> the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, 
> as well as perform the knight's tour, 
> a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.
>
> The Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion 
> that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. 
> With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played 
> during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, 
> playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. 
> 
> The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel. 
> The chessmasters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, 
> William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, 
> but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain unknown.
