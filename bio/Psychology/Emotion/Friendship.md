> **Friendship** is a relationship of mutual affection between people. 
> It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", 
> such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague.
>
> Although there are many forms of friendship, certain features are common to many such bonds, 
> such as choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together, 
> and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another.
>
> Sometimes friends are distinguished from family, as in the saying "friends and family", 
> and sometimes from lovers (e.g., "lovers and friends"), 
> although the line is blurred with friends with benefits. 
> Similarly, being in the friend zone describes someone 
> who is restricted from rising from the status of friend to that of lover (see also unrequited love).
>
> Friendship has been studied in academic fields, 
> such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. 
> 
> Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, 
> including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.
