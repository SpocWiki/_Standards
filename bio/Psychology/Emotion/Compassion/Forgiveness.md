## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Forgiveness**, in a psychological sense, is the intentional and voluntary process 
> by which one who may have felt initially wronged, victimized, harmed, or hurt 
> goes through a process of changing feelings and attitude regarding a given offender for their actions, 
> and overcomes the impact of the offense, flaw, or mistake 
> including negative emotions such as resentment or a desire for vengeance. 
> 
> Theorists differ in the extent to which they believe 
> forgiveness also implies replacing the negative emotions with positive attitudes 
> (e.g., an increased ability to tolerate the offender), or requires reconciliation with the offender.
>
> Forgiveness is interpreted in many ways by different people and cultures. 
> As a psychological concept and as a virtue, the obligation to forgive and the benefits of forgiveness 
> have been explored in religious thought, moral philosophy, social sciences, and medicine.
>
> On the psychological level, forgiveness is different from simple condoning 
> (viewing action as harmful, yet to be "forgiven" or overlooked for certain reasons of "charity"), 
> excusing or pardoning (merely releasing the offender from responsibility for their actions), 
> or forgetting (attempting to remove from one's consciousness the memory of an offense). 
> 
> In some schools of thought, it involves a personal and "voluntary" effort 
> at the self-transformation of one's half of a relationship with another, 
> such that one is restored to peace and ideally 
> to what psychologist Carl Rogers has referred to as "unconditional positive regard" towards the other.
>
> In many contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, 
> and may be granted without any response on the part of the offender 
> (for example, one may forgive a person who is incommunicado or dead). 
> In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, 
> such as an apology, or to explicitly ask for forgiveness, 
> for the wronged person to believe themselves able to forgive.
>
> Most world religions include teachings on forgiveness, 
> and many of these provide a foundation for various modern traditions and practices of forgiveness. 
> Some religious doctrines or philosophies emphasize the need for people 
> to find divine forgiveness for their shortcomings; 
> others place greater emphasis on the need for people to forgive one another.
