## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hatred** or hate is an intense negative emotional response 
> towards certain people, things or ideas, 
> usually related to opposition or revulsion toward something. 
> 
> Hatred is often associated with intense feelings of anger, contempt, and disgust. 
> Hatred is sometimes seen as the opposite of love. 
>
> A number of different definitions and perspectives on hatred have been put forth. Philosophers have been concerned with understanding the essence and nature of hatred, while some religions view it positively and encourage hatred toward certain outgroups. Social and psychological theorists have understood hatred in a utilitarian sense. Certain public displays of hatred are sometimes legally proscribed in the context of pluralistic cultures that value tolerance. 
>
> Hatred may encompass a wide range of gradations of emotion and have very different expressions depending on the cultural context and the situation that triggers the emotional or intellectual response. Based on the context in which hatred occurs, it may be viewed favorably, unfavorably, or neutrally by different societies.
