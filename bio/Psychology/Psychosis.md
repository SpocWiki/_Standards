> In psychopathology, **Psychosis** is a condition in which one is 
> unable to distinguish, in one's experience of life, between what is and is not real. 
> 
> Examples of psychotic symptoms are delusions, hallucinations, 
> and disorganized or incoherent thoughts or speech. 
> Psychosis is a description of a person's state or symptoms, 
> rather than a particular mental illness, and it is not related to psychopathy 
> (a personality construct characterized by impaired empathy and remorse, 
> along with bold, disinhibited, and egocentric traits).
>
> Common causes of chronic (i.e. ongoing or repeating) psychosis include 
> schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and brain damage 
> (usually as a result of alcoholism).  
> 
> Acute (temporary) psychosis can also be caused by severe distress, 
> sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, some medications, and drug use 
> (including alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, and stimulants). 
> 
> Acute psychosis is termed primary if it results from a psychiatric condition 
> and secondary if it is caused by another medical condition or drugs. 
> 
> The diagnosis of a mental-health condition requires excluding other potential causes. 
> Tests can be done to check whether psychosis is caused 
> - by central nervous system diseases, toxins, 
> - or other health problems.
>
> Treatment may include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and social support. 
> Early treatment appears to improve outcomes. 
> Medications appear to have a moderate effect. 
> Outcomes depend on the underlying cause. 
>
> Psychosis is not well-understood at the neurological level, 
> but dopamine (along with other neurotransmitters) is known to play an important role. 
> In the United States about 3% of people develop psychosis at some point in their lives. 
> Psychosis has been described as early as the 4th century BC by Hippocrates 
> and possibly as early as 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus.
