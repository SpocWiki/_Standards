## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Neurosis** (pl. neuroses) is a term mainly used today 
> by followers of Freudian psychoanalytic theory 
> to describe mental disorders caused by past anxiety, 
> often anxieties that have undergone repression. 
> In recent history, the term has been used to refer to anxiety-related conditions more generally.
>
> The term "neurosis" is no longer used in psychological disorder names or categories 
> by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 
> or the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). 
> According to the American Heritage Medical Dictionary of 2007, 
> the term is "no longer used in psychiatric diagnosis".
>
> Neurosis is distinguished from psychosis, which refers to a loss of touch with reality. 
> Its descendant term, neuroticism, refers to a personality trait of being 
> prone to anxiousness and mental collapse. 
> 
> The term "[[../Personality_Psychology/Personality~Big5/Big5~Emotional_Stability|neuroticism]]" is also no longer used for DSM or ICD conditions; 
> however, it is a common name for one of the Big Five personality traits. 
> A similar concept is included in the ICD-11 as the condition "negative affectivity".
