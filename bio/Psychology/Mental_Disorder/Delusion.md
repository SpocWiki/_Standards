## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Delusion** is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. 
> As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, 
> confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or some other misleading effects of perception, 
> as individuals with those beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon reviewing the evidence. 
> However:
> "The distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends in part on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or reasonable contradictory evidence regarding its veracity."
>
> Delusions occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) 
> and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, 
> paraphrenia, manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression.
