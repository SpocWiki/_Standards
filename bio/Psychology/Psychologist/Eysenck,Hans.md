> Hans Jürgen Eysenck ( EYE-zenk; 4 March 1916 – 4 September 1997) 
> was a German-born British psychologist. 
> He is best remembered for his work on intelligence and personality, 
> although he worked on other issues in psychology. 
> At the time of his death, Eysenck was the most frequently cited living psychologist 
> in peer-reviewed scientific journal literature.
>
> Eysenck's research included claims 
> that certain personality types had an elevated risk of cancer and heart disease 
> and research on IQ scores and race (first published in 1971), 
> which were a significant source of controversy. 
> 
> Scholars have identified errors and suspected data manipulation in Eysenck's work, 
> and large replications have failed to confirm the relationships that he purported to find. 
> 
> An enquiry on behalf of King's College London found the papers by Eysenck coauthored with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek to be "incompatible with modern clinical science", with 26 of the joint papers considered suspect. 
> 
> Fourteen papers were retracted in 2020, 
> and over 60 statements of concern were issued by scientific journals in 2020 
> about publications by Eysenck. 
> 
> David Marks and Rod Buchanan, a biographer of Eysenck, 
> have argued that 87 publications by Eysenck should be retracted.
