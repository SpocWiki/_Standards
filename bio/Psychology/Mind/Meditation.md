## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Meditation** is a practice in which an individual uses a technique 
> to train attention and awareness and detach from reflexive, "discursive thinking", 
> achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state, 
> while not judging the meditation process itself.
>
> Techniques are broadly classified into focused (or concentrative) and open monitoring methods. - Focused methods involve attention to specific objects like breath or mantras, 
> - while open monitoring includes mindfulness and awareness of mental events.
>
> Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions, 
> though it is also practiced independently from any religious or spiritual influences 
> for its health benefits. 
> 
> The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, 
> and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of 
> Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism. 
> 
> Meditation-like techniques are also known in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, 
> in the context of remembrance of and prayer and devotion to God.
>
> Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures 
> where they have found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health. 
> 
> Meditation may significantly reduce stress, fear, anxiety, depression, and pain, 
> and enhance peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being. 
> 
> Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health 
> (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
