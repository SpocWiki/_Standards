> **Optimism** is the attitude or mindset of **expecting** events to lead to particularly 
> positive, favorable, desirable, and hopeful outcomes. 
> 
> A common idiom used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism 
> is a glass filled with water to the halfway point: 
> - an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, 
> - while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty. 
> In ordinary English, optimism may be synonymous with idealismâ€”
> often, unrealistic or foolish optimism in particular.
>
> The term derives from the Latin optimum, meaning "best". To be optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is to expect the best possible outcome from any given situation. This is usually referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism. It reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best. As a trait, it fosters resilience in the face of stress.
>
> Theories of optimism include dispositional models and models of explanatory style. Methods to measure optimism have been developed within both of these theoretical approaches, such as various forms of the Life Orientation Test for the original dispositional definition of optimism and the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style.
>
> Variation in optimism between people is somewhat heritable and reflects biological trait systems to some degree. A person's optimism is also influenced by environmental factors, including family environment, and may be learnable. Optimism may also be related to health.
