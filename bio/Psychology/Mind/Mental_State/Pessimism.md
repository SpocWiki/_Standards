> **Pessimism** is a mental attitude in which 
> an undesirable outcome is **anticipated** from a given situation. 
> 
> Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. 
> A common question asked to test for pessimism is "Is the glass half empty or half full?"; 
> - in this situation, a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, 
>   or in extreme cases completely empty, 
> - while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full. 
> 
> Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.
