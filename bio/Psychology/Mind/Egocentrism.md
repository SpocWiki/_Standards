> **Egocentrism** refers to difficulty differentiating between self and other. 
> More specifically, it is difficulty in accurately perceiving 
> and understanding perspectives other than one's own.
>
> Egocentrism is found across the life span: in infancy, early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. 
>
> Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood, 
> the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates 
> that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion. 
> 
> Adults appear to be less egocentric than children 
> because they are faster to correct from an initially egocentric perspective than children, 
> not because they are less likely to initially adopt an egocentric perspective.
