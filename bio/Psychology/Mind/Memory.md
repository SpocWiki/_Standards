> **Memory** is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored,

> - long-term memory.

## explicit memory 

Declarative, or explicit memory, is the conscious storage and recollection of data. 
Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory. 

### explicit Memory is re-constructive  

Memory works usually re-constructive, i
.e. it is re-constructed each time from loose Fragments. 
Many Details are made up when missing. 
The more often it is reconstructed, the more we believe in it, 
even when it becomes distorted. 
Even Flashlight Memories like 9/11 are subject to that. 

Exceptions are traumatic Experiences. 


### Episodic Memory 

Autobiographic, Associative 

Episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane. 
Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory. 

### Semantic Memory 

Facts 

Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning. 


## implicit memory 

Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information. 
An example of a non-declarative process would be the 
unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, 
or a priming phenomenon. 

### Procedural Memory 

Capabilities 

Procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills 
that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.


### Priming

Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory 
and shows that not all memory is consciously activated,
