Named, because it lies at the Border between early Definitions of [[../Mental_Disorder/Neurosis|Neurosis]] and [[../Psychosis|Psychosis]]. 
Emotion Regulation does not work. 
Genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences (Abuse or Neglect) cause this. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Borderline Personality Disorder** (BPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a 
> pervasive, long-term pattern of significant interpersonal relationship instability, 
> an acute fear of abandonment, and intense emotional outbursts. 
> 
> The name of the disorder, particularly the suitability of the term borderline, 
> is a subject of ongoing debate. 
> 
> Initially, the term reflected historical ideas of borderline insanity 
> and later described patients on the border between neurosis and psychosis. 
> These interpretations are now regarded as outdated and clinically imprecise.
>
> People diagnosed with BPD frequently exhibit self-harming behaviours 
> and engage in risky activities, 
> primarily due to challenges regulating emotional states to a healthy, stable baseline. 
> 
> Symptoms such as dissociation (a feeling of detachment from reality), 
> a pervasive sense of emptiness, and distorted sense of self are prevalent among those affected.
>
> The onset of BPD symptoms 
> can be triggered by events that others might perceive as normal, 
> with the disorder typically manifesting in early adulthood 
> and persisting across diverse contexts. 
> 
> BPD is often comorbid with substance abuse, depressive disorders, and eating disorders. 
> BPD is associated with a substantial risk of suicide; 
> studies estimated that up to 10 percent of people with BPD die by suicide. 
> BPD faces significant stigmatization in both media portrayals and the psychiatric field, 
> potentially leading to underdiagnosis and insufficient treatment.
>
> The causes of BPD are unclear and complex, implicating genetic, neurological, 
> and psychosocial conditions in its development. 
> 
> The current hypothesis suggests BPD to be 
> caused by an interaction between genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences. 
> 
> BPD is significantly more common in people with a family history of BPD, 
> particularly immediate relatives, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition. 
> 
> The American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classifies 
> BPD in cluster B ("dramatic, emotional, or erratic" PDs) among personality disorders. 
> 
> There is a risk of misdiagnosis, with BPD most commonly confused with a 
> - mood disorder, 
> - substance use disorder, or 
> - other mental health disorders.
>
> Therapeutic interventions for BPD predominantly involve psychotherapy, 
> with dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and schema therapy the most effective modalities. 
> 
> Although pharmacotherapy cannot cure BPD, 
> it may be employed to mitigate associated symptoms, with atypical antipsychotics 
> (e.g., Quetiapine) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants commonly being prescribed, though their efficacy is unclear. 
> A 2020 meta-analysis found the use of medications was still unsupported by evidence.
>
> BPD has a point prevalence of 1.6% 
> and a lifetime prevalence of 5.9% of the global population, 
> with a higher incidence rate among women compared to men 
> in the clinical setting of up to three times. 
> 
> Despite the high utilization of healthcare resources by people with BPD, 
> up to half may show significant improvement over ten years with appropriate treatment.
