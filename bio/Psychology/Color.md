# [[Color]] 

Color is a human physiological Phenomenon. 

Physically, Colors are just different Frequencies of EM Waves. 

## Color-Perception
Humans have 2 Systems for visual Perception: 

### Black & White for dark environments 

### 3-Color Vision with sufficient Light 
unless one or more Receptors are missing e.g. due to genetic defects. 

Color Vision distinguishes mixed Colors as fundamentally different. 
Colors are also symbolically loaded. 

Monochromatic Light triggers multiple Receptors as represented by the Curve. 
But it cannot create every Color Sensation, only mixed Light can do this. 
Theoretically, any color Perception can be created using 3 sufficiently different Wavelengths. 

## RGB-W & additive Mixing 
This is applied with actively radiating Media. 

## CMY-K & subtractive Mixing 
This is applied universally with passive/absorptive Media. 
These colors are the Complements of the RGB-W Spectrum. 


Our Eyes can perceive 3 basic colors from which other Colors can be derived by either Subtraction or Addition. 

## additive Colors 

These can be arranged at the 4 Corners of the Origin in the Unit-Square 

### Red = 

### Green = 

### Blue = 

### Black = White - Red - Green - Blue 


## Subtractive Colors 

These can be arranged at the 4 Corners of the (1,1,1) Corner of the Unit-Square 

### Cyan = Green + Blue 

### Magenta = Red + Blue 

### Yellow = Red + Green 

### White = Red + Green + Blue 


## Color Cone 

It is more natural to describe the color in Terms of 
- Lightness (from 0 to 1)  
- Saturation (from 0 to 1)  
- Chroma (from 0 to 2 * Pi) 

Since Saturation and Chroma make no Sense in Darkness, 
these form a cone with a Black Tip and White in the Center of the Base.

> For most humans, colors are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). 
> Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types

> Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength

> Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation), and luminance.

> Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) 
> or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors, and television. Some of the most well-known color models and color spaces are RGB, CMYK, HSL/HSV, CIE Lab, and YCbCr/YUV.

> Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple), and tertiary colors. The study of colors in general is called color science.
