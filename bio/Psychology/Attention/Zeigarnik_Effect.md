> In psychology, the **Zeigarnik effect** (named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik) 
> postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. 
> 
> In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to 
> demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: 
> not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.
>
> The Zeigarnik effect should not be confused with the Ovsiankina effect, 
> an urge to complete tasks previously initiated. 
> Maria Ovsiankina, a colleague of Zeigarnik, investigated 
> the effect of task interruption on the tendency to resume the task at the next opportunity.
