> **Hypocrisy** is the practice of feigning to be what one is not or to believe what one does not. 
> The word "hypocrisy" entered the English language c. 1200 with the meaning 
> "the sin of pretending to virtue or goodness". 
> 
> Today, "hypocrisy" often refers to advocating behaviors that one does not practice. 
> However, the term can also refer to other forms of pretense, 
> such as engaging in pious or moral behaviors out of a desire for praise 
> rather than out of genuinely pious or moral motivations. 
>
> Definitions of hypocrisy vary. 
> In moral psychology, it is the failure to follow one's own expressed moral rules and principles. 
> According to British political philosopher David Runciman, 
> "other kinds of hypocritical deception include 
> - claims to knowledge that one lacks, 
> - claims to a consistency that one cannot sustain, 
> - claims to a loyalty that one does not possess, 
> - claims to an identity that one does not hold". 
> American political journalist Michael Gerson says that 
> political hypocrisy is "the conscious use of a mask to fool the public and gain political benefit".
>
> Hypocrisy has been a subject of folk wisdom 
> and wisdom literature from the beginnings of human history. 
> 
> Increasingly, since the 1980s, it has also become central to studies in 
> - behavioral economics, 
> - cognitive science, 
> - cultural psychology, 
> - decision making, 
> - ethics, 
> - evolutionary psychology, 
> - moral psychology, 
> - political sociology, 
> - positive psychology,
