## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Romance or **Romantic love** is a feeling of strong attraction towards another person, 
> the mental state of being "in love" focused towards forming a relationship (or pair bond), 
> the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to express those feelings and resultant emotions, and the practice of initiating relationships based on passionate feelings over more practical or ordinary concerns. Romantic love is considered to be a motivation or drive, which is distinct from (but related to) the concept of attachment.
>
> Collins Dictionary defines romantic love as "an intensity and idealization of a love relationship, in which the other is imbued with extraordinary virtue, beauty, etc., so that the relationship overrides all other considerations, including material ones." The concept of romantic love also came to represent the idea of individualistic choice in marriage and sexual partners, although it's rarely realized fully and can be a source of both gratification and disappointment in relationships. The terms "romance" and "romantic love" are used with multiple definitions, which can be contradictory at times.
>
> People who experience little to no romantic attraction are referred to as aromantic.
