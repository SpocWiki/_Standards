## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Stockholm syndrome is a proposed condition 
> to explain why hostages occasionally develop a psychological bond with their captors. 
> 
> It is named after an attempted bank robbery in 1973, in Stockholm, Sweden, 
> in which four people were held hostage but later refused to testify against the robbers. 
> 
> Stockholm syndrome has 
> never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 
> the authoritative guide for diagnosis of psychiatric conditions used in the United States, 
> due to the lack of any academic study of the condition, 
> and an increasing body of evidence leading to doubt about the legitimacy of the condition.
