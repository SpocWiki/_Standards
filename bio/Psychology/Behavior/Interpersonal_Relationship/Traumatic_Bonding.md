## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Trauma bonds (also referred to as traumatic bonds) 
> are emotional bonds that arise from a cyclical pattern of abuse. 
> 
> A trauma bond occurs in an abusive relationship, 
> wherein the victim forms an emotional bond with the perpetrator. 
> The concept was developed by psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter.
>
> The two main factors that contribute to the establishment of a trauma bond 
> are a power imbalance and intermittent reward and punishment. 
> 
> Trauma bonding can occur within romantic relationships, platonic friendships, 
> parent-child relationships, incestuous relationships, cults, hostage situations, 
> sex trafficking (especially that of minors), hazing or tours of duty among military personnel.
>
> Trauma bonds are based on terror, dominance, and unpredictability. 
> As the trauma bond between an abuser and a victim strengthens, 
> it can lead to cyclical patterns of conflicting emotions. 
> 
> Frequently, victims in trauma bonds do not have agency, autonomy, 
> or an individual sense of self. 
> Their self-image is an internalization of the abuser's conceptualization of them.
>
> Trauma bonds have severe detrimental effects on the victim. 
> Some long-term impacts of trauma bonding include 
> - remaining in abusive relationships, 
> - adverse mental health outcomes like 
> 	- low self-esteem and 
> 	- negative self-image, 
> - an increased likelihood of depression and bipolar disorder, 
> - and perpetuating a generational cycle of abuse. 
> 
> Victims who develop trauma bonds are often unable or unwilling to leave these relationships. 
> Many abuse victims who experience trauma bonding return to the abusive relationship.
>
> Trauma bonding is frequently mistaken for the emotional bond between survivors of a shared experience.
