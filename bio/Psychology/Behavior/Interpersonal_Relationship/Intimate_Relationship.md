## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An intimate relationship is an interpersonal relationship 
> that involves emotional or physical closeness between people 
> and may include feelings of romance or love and sexual intimacy. 
> 
> Intimate relationships are interdependent, 
> and the members of the relationship mutually influence each other. 
> 
> The quality and nature of the relationship depends on the interactions between individuals, 
> and is derived from the unique context and history that builds between people over time. Social and legal institutions such as marriage acknowledge and uphold intimate relationships between people. However, intimate relationships are not necessarily monogamous or sexual, and there is wide social and cultural variability in the norms and practices of intimacy between people.
>
> 
>
> The course of an intimate relationship includes a formation period prompted by interpersonal attraction and a growing sense of closeness and familiarity. Intimate relationships evolve over time as they are maintained, and members of the relationship may become more invested in and committed to the relationship. Healthy intimate relationships are beneficial for psychological and physical well-being and contribute to overall happiness in life. However, challenges including relationship conflict, external stressors, insecurity, and jealousy can disrupt the relationship and lead to distress and relationship dissolution.
