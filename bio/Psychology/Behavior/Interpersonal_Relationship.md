## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In social psychology, an interpersonal relation (or interpersonal relationship) 
> describes a social association, connection, or affiliation between two or more people. 
> 
> It overlaps significantly with the concept of social relations, 
> which are the fundamental unit of analysis within the social sciences. 
> 
> Relations vary in degrees of intimacy, self-disclosure, duration, reciprocity, 
> and power distribution. 
> 
> The main themes or trends of the interpersonal relations are: 
> family, kinship, friendship, love, marriage, business, employment, clubs, neighborhoods, ethical values, support, and solidarity. 
> 
> Interpersonal relations may be regulated by law, custom, or mutual agreement, 
> and form the basis of social groups and societies. 
> They appear when people communicate or act with each other within specific social contexts, and they thrive on equitable and reciprocal compromises.
>
> Interdisciplinary analysis of relationships draws heavily upon the other social sciences, 
> including, but not limited to: anthropology, communication, cultural studies, economics, linguistics, mathematics, political science, social work, and sociology. 
> 
> This scientific analysis had evolved during the 1990s and has become "relationship science", through the research done by Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Hatfield. This interdisciplinary science attempts to provide evidence-based conclusions through the use of data analysis.
