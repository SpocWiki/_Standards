## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A vegetative state (VS)  or post-coma unresponsiveness (PCU) 
> is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage 
> are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. 
> 
> After four weeks in a vegetative state, 
> the patient is classified as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). 
> 
> This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months 
> (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. 
> 
> The term unresponsive wakefulness syndrome may be used alternatively, 
> as "vegetative state" has some negative connotations among the public. 
> 
> It is occasionally also called Apallic syndrome or Apallisches syndrome, 
> borrowings from German, primarily in European or older sources.
