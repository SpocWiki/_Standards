> **Voting** is the process of choosing one or more officials or representatives 
> by casting an oral vote or a ballot, 
> a document that formally expresses voter's preference or preferences 
> as to whom should be elected or whom the voter likes 
> and thinks has best chance to be elected. 
> 
> Voting can also be used to decide on policy 
> usually by a majority but sometimes a super-majority is required. 
> 
> In Republics and representative democracies, 
> a portion of the population votes to choose representative government members.
>
> Electoral systems, the procedure for converting votes cast into winners, 
> vary depending on both the country and the political office. 
> 
> In many countries organizations work to reform the election system, usually to make it fairer 
> and ensure that as many votes as possible are used to elect the winners.
>
> In organizations and non-government settings, voting may occur in different ways: 
> - formally via a paper vote to elect others for example within a workplace, 
>   to elect members of political associations, or to choose roles for others; 
> - or informally with a spoken agreement or a raised hand or other gesture. 
> In larger organizations, like countries, voting is generally confined to periodic elections.
>
> All modern liberal democracies use voting by secret ballot 
> to prevent individuals from becoming influenced by other people 
> and to protect their political privacy. 
> 
> The objective of secret ballots is to try to achieve the most authentic outcome, 
> without any risk of pressure, threat, or services linked to one's vote; 
> this way, a person is able to express their actual preferences.
>
> Voting often takes place at a polling station 
> but voting can also be done remotely by mail or using internet voting (such as in Estonia). 
> Voting is voluntary in some countries, like the UK, 
> but it may be required by law in others, such as Australia.
