> **Reason** is the capacity of consciously applying logic 
> by drawing valid conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking truth. 
> 
> It is associated with such characteristically human activities as 
> philosophy, religion, science, language, and mathematics, 
> and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. 
> Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality, although the latter is more about its application.
>
> Reasoning involves using more-or-less rational processes of thinking and cognition 
> to extrapolate from one's existing knowledge to generate new knowledge, 
> and involves the use of one's intellect. 
> 
> The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can 
> use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments and true conclusions. 
> Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, 
> such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning.
>
> Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), 
> and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—
> may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. 
> 
> In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, 
> while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary 
> rather than adversarial. 
> 
> For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary 
> for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, 
> arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.
>
> Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways 
> by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. 
> 
> For example, reasoning is the means by which 
> rational individuals understand the significance of sensory information from their environments, 
> or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, 
> truth and falsehood, or good and evil. 
> 
> Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, 
> is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of 
> goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, 
> and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.
>
> Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, 
> e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, 
> and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. 
> 
> The field of automated reasoning studies 
> how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. 
> 
> Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.
