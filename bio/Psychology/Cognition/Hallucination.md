> A **Hallucination** is a perception in the absence of an external context stimulus 
> that has the compelling sense of reality. 
> 
> They are distinguishable from several related phenomena, such as 
> - dreaming (REM sleep), which does not involve wakefulness; 
> - pseudohallucination, which does not mimic real perception, and is accurately perceived as unreal; 
> - illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; and 
> - mental imagery, which does not mimic real perception, and is under voluntary control. 
> Hallucinations also differ from "delusional perceptions", 
> in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) 
> is given some additional significance.
>
> Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive and chronoceptive. Hallucinations are referred to as multimodal if multiple sensory modalities occur.
>
> A mild form of hallucination is known as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious (cursing the subject). 55% of auditory hallucinations are malicious in content, for example, people talking about the subject, not speaking to them directly. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject. This can produce a feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.
>
> Hypnagogic hallucinations and hypnopompic hallucinations are considered normal phenomena. Hypnagogic hallucinations can occur as one is falling asleep and hypnopompic hallucinations occur when one is waking up. Hallucinations can be associated with drug use (particularly deliriants), sleep deprivation, psychosis (including stress-related psychosis), neurological disorders, and delirium tremens. Many hallucinations happen also during sleep paralysis.
>
> The word "hallucination" itself was introduced into the English language by the 17th-century physician Sir Thomas Browne in 1646 from the derivation of the Latin word alucinari meaning to wander in the mind. For Browne, hallucination means a sort of vision that is "depraved and receive[s] its objects erroneously".
