## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Cognitive psychology is the scientific study of human mental processes such as 
> attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning. 
> 
> Cognitive psychology originated in the 1960s in a break from behaviorism, 
> which held from the 1920s to 1950s that unobservable mental processes 
> were outside the realm of empirical science. 
> 
> This break came as researchers in linguistics, cybernetics, and applied psychology used models of mental processing to explain human behavior. Work derived from cognitive psychology was integrated into other branches of psychology and various other modern disciplines like cognitive science, linguistics, and economics.
