> In personality psychology and psychometrics, the Big 5 or five-factor model (FFM) 
> is a widely used scientific model for describing how personality traits differ 
> across people using five distinct factors:
> - openness (O) measures creativity, curiosity, and willingness to entertain new ideas. 
> - conscientiousness (C) measures self-control, diligence, and attention to detail. 
> - extraversion (E) measures boldness, energy, and social interactivity. 
> - amicability or agreeableness (A) measures kindness, helpfulness, and willingness to cooperate. 
> - neuroticism (N) measures depression, irritability, and moodiness. 
>
> These traits are not black and white; each one is a spectrum, 
> with personality varying continuously across each of these dimensions 
> (unlike in the MBTI inventory).
>
> The five-factor model was among the first personality models in psychology 
> derived from empirical research into natural-language data 
> which found consistent correlations between the adjectives people use to describe themselves. 
> For example, someone described as conscientious 
> is more likely to be described as "always prepared", 
> and less likely to be described as "messy".
>
> Research into personality inventories found five broad dimensions 
> could explain most variation in human personality and temperament, 
> with more-detailed analyses typically dividing the traits into more specific subfactors. 
> 
> For example, extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, 
> assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions. 
> 
> Other models, like HEXACO, supplement the Big 5 traits with additional variables.
>
> Today, the five-factor model underlies most contemporary personality research, 
> and the model has been described as a major breakthroughs of quantitative behavioural science. 
> 
> The five-factor structure has been confirmed by many subsequent studies across cultures 
> and languages, which have replicated the original model and reported largely similar factors.
