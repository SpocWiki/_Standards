# [[Big5~Openness]] 

#is_/part_of :: [[../Personality~Big5]] 

openness (O) measures creativity, curiosity, and willingness to entertain new ideas. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Openness to experience** is one of the domains which are 
> used to describe human personality in the Five Factor Model. 
> 
> Openness involves six facets, or dimensions: 
> - active imagination (fantasy), 
> - aesthetic sensitivity, 
> - attentiveness to inner feelings, 
> - preference for variety (adventurousness), 
> - intellectual curiosity, 
> - and challenging authority (psychological liberalism). 
> 
> A great deal of psychometric research has demonstrated that 
> these facets or qualities are significantly correlated. 
> Thus, openness can be viewed as a global personality trait 
> consisting of a set of specific traits, habits, and tendencies that cluster together.
>
> Openness tends to be normally distributed, with a small number of people scoring extremely high or low on the trait and most people scoring moderately. 
> People who score low on openness are considered to be closed to experience. 
> They tend to be conventional and traditional in their outlook and behavior. 
> They prefer familiar routines to new experiences, and generally have a narrower range of interests.
>
> Openness has moderate positive relationships with creativity, intelligence, and knowledge. 
> Openness is related to the psychological trait of absorption, 
> and like absorption has a modest relationship to individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility. 
> Openness has more modest relationships with aspects of subjective well-being than other Five Factor Model personality traits.
>
> On the whole, openness appears to be largely unrelated to symptoms of mental disorders.
