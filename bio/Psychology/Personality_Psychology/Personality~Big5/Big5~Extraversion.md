> **Extraversion** and introversion are a central trait dimension in human personality theory. 
> 
> The terms were introduced into psychology by Carl Jung, 
> though both the popular understanding and current psychological usage 
> are not the same as Jung's original concept. 
> 
> Extraversion (also spelled extroversion) is typically associated with sociability, talkativeness, and high energy, 
> while introversion is linked to introspection, reserve, and a preference for solitary activities. 
> 
> Jung defined them as attitude-types characterised by...: 
> - introversion: "orientation in life through subjective psychic contents", 
> - and extraversion: "concentration of interest on the external object".
>
> While often presented as opposite ends of a single continuum, 
> many personality theorists, such as Carl Jung, have suggested that 
> most individuals possesses elements of both traits, with one being more dominant. 
> 
> Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. 
> Examples include 
> - the Big Five model, 
> - Jung's analytical psychology, 
> - Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, 
> - Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors,
