> The **HEXACO model of personality structure** is a six-dimensional model of human personality 
> that was created by Michael C. Ashton and Kibeom Lee in 2013 
> and explained in their book [The H Factor of Personality](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781554588640), 
> based on findings from a series of lexical studies 
> involving several European and Asian languages. 
> 
> The six factors, or dimensions, include 
> - H: honesty-humility (H), 
> - E: emotionality (E), 
> - X: extraversioN (X), 
> - A: agreeableness (A), 
> - C: conscientiousness (C), and 
> - O: openness to experience (O). 
> 
> Each factor is composed of traits with characteristics indicating high and low levels of the factor. 
> 
> The HEXACO model was developed through similar methods as other trait taxonomies 
> and builds on the work of Costa and McCrae and Goldberg. 
> 
> The model, therefore, shares several common elements with other trait models. 
> However, the HEXACO model is unique mainly due to the 
> addition of the honesty-humility dimension.
