> **Consciousness**, at its simplest, is awareness of internal and external existence. 
> 
> However, its nature has led to millennia of analyses, explanations, 
> and debate by philosophers, scientists, and theologians. 
> 
> Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. 
> In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of it. 
> 
> In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination, and volition. 
> 
> Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling, or perception. 
> 
> It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, metacognition, or self-awareness, either continuously changing or not. 
> The disparate range of research, notions, and speculations 
> raises a curiosity about whether the right questions are being asked.
>
> Examples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: 
> - ordered distinction between self and environment, 
> - simple wakefulness, 
> - one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; 
> - being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or 
> - being a mental state, mental event, or mental process of the brain.
