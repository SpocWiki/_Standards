## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Gnetophyta is a division of plants (alternatively considered the subclass Gnetidae or order **Gnetales**), 
> grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), 
> that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: 
> - Gnetum (family Gnetaceae), 
> - Welwitschia (family Welwitschiaceae), and 
> - Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). 
> 
> The earliest unambiguous records of the group date to the Jurassic, 
> and they achieved their highest diversity during the Early Cretaceous. 
> 
> The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms 
> is the presence of vessel elements, a system of small tubes (xylem) 
> that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. 
> 
> Because of this, gnetophytes were once 
> thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, 
> but more recent molecular studies have brought this hypothesis into question, 
> with many recent phylogenies finding them to be nested within the conifers.
>
> Though it is clear they are all related, 
> the exact evolutionary inter-relationships between gnetophytes are unclear. 
> 
> Some classifications hold that all three genera should be placed in a single order(Gnetales), 
> while other classifications say they should be distributed among three separate orders, 
> each containing a single family and genus. 
> 
> Most morphological and molecular studies confirm that the genera 
> Gnetum and Welwitschia diverged from each other more recently than they did from Ephedra.
