## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Asparagales** (asparagoid lilies) are a diverse order of flowering plants in the monocots. 
> 
> Under the APG IV system of flowering plant classification, 
> Asparagales are the largest order of monocots 
> with 14 families, 1,122 genera, and about 36,000 species, with members as varied as 
> asparagus, orchids, yuccas, irises, onions, garlic, leeks, and other Alliums, 
> daffodils, snowdrops, amaryllis, agaves, butcher's broom, Agapanthus, Solomon's seal, 
> hyacinths, bluebells, spider plants, grasstrees, aloe, freesias, gladioli, crocuses, and saffron.
>
> Most species of Asparagales are herbaceous perennials, 
> although some are climbers and some are trees or shrubs. 
> 
> The order also contains many geophytes (bulbs, corms, and various kinds of tuber). 
> 
> The leaves of almost all species form a tight rosette, 
> either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem, but occasionally along the stem. 
> 
> The flowers are not particularly distinctive, being 'lily type', with six tepals and up to six stamina. 
> One of the defining characteristics (synapomorphies) of the order 
> is the presence of phytomelanin, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. 
> Phytomelanin is found in most families of the Asparagales 
> (although not in Orchidaceae, thought to be the sister-group of the rest of the order).
>
> The order Asparagales takes its name from the type family Asparagaceae 
> and has only recently been recognized in classification systems. 
> 
> The order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, 
> but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse. 
> 
> The order was first put forward by Huber in 1977 
> and later taken up in the Dahlgren system of 1985 
> and then the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group systems. 
> 
> Before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order Liliales, 
> which was redistributed over three orders, Liliales, Asparagales, and Dioscoreales, 
> based on molecular phylogenetics. 
> 
> The boundaries of the Asparagales and of its families 
> have undergone a series of changes in recent years; 
> future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability.
>
> The order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots 
> some 120–130 million years ago (early in the Cretaceous period), 
> although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved, estimates are likely to be uncertain.
>
> From an economic point of view, the order Asparagales is second in importance 
> within the monocots only to the order Poales (which includes grasses and cereals). 
> 
> Species are used as 
> - food and flavourings (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla, saffron), 
> - in medicinal or cosmetic applications (Aloe), 
> - as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, gladiolus, iris, orchids), and 
> - as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, lily of the valley, Agapanthus).
