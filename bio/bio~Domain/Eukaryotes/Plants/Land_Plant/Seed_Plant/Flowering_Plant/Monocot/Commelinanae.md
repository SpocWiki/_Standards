> Commelinales is an order of flowering plants. It comprises five families: 
> - Commelinaceae, 
> - Haemodoraceae, 
> - Hanguanaceae, 
> - Philydraceae, and 
> - Pontederiaceae. 
> 
> All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70 genera; 
> the majority of species are in the Commelinaceae. 
> 
> Plants in the order share a number of synapomorphies that tie them together, 
> such as a lack of mycorrhizal associations and tapetal raphides. 
> 
> Estimates differ as to when the Commelinales evolved, 
> but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late Cretaceous. 
> 
> Studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, 
> with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. 
> The order's closest relatives are in the Zingiberales, 
> which includes ginger, bananas, cardamom, and others.

## Introduction

[William J. Hahn](http://www.tolweb.org/)

The Commelinanae includes the grasses, sedges, bromeliads, and relatives. 
This superorder includes approximately 25 families, 1075 genera, and 24000 species.

### Characteristics

The Commelinanae are characterized by scrobiculate pollen 
with operculate apertures and orthotropous ovules, 
girdle-like endothecial thickenings of the anthers, 
annulate pollen apertures, and apical placentation (Linder and Kellogg, 1993).
