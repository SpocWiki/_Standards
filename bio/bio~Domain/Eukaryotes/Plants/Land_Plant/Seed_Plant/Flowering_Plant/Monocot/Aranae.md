## Introduction

[William J. Hahn](http://www.tolweb.org/)

The aroids are a predominantly tropical group of herbaceous terrestrial or epiphytic plants. 
Edible plants, poisonous species, ornamentals. 
The superorder contains 2 families, 110 genera, and approximately 2500 species.

### Characteristics

The aroids are distinguished by distichous leaves, paracytic stomata,
carpels with multiple ovules, and albuminous seeds (Grayum, 1990). A
close relationships to the alismatids is supported in most analyses.
