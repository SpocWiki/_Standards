## Introduction

[Erin Tripp]() 

The *Ruellia humilis* clade is has been resolved as sister to
*Euruellia*, but this relationships is still tentative and thus is not
depicted on the Ruellia s.l. tree. Species in this group differ from
those in *Euruellia* by having reduced inflorescences with subsessile
flowers in axillary cymes. They also have slightly clavate capsules (vs.
elliptical in *Euruellia*) that contain fewer ovules. Plants in the *R.
humilis* clade are distributed in the eastern United States, reaching
their northernmost limits in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The latter
state represents the northernmost distribution of the genus in the
western hemisphere, and perhaps the northernmost globally.\

Most if not all species in this clade produce cleistogamous (see photo
above) in addition to open flowers, either after the regular flowering
season, or concurrently. Species sampled in Tripp\'s study (in press)
are listed above, though the group likely includes other species such as
*Ruellia ciliosa* Pursh, and the white-flowered, night blooming *Ruellia
noctiflora* (Nees) A. Gray.\
