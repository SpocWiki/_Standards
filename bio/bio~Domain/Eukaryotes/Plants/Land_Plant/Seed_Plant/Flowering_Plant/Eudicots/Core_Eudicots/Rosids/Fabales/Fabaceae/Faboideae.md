>
> This subfamily is widely distributed, and members are adapted to a wide variety of environments. 
> 
> Faboideae may be trees, shrubs, or herbaceous plants. 
> Members include the pea, the sweet pea, the laburnum, and other legumes. 
> The pea-shaped flowers are characteristic of the Faboideae subfamily and root nodulation is very common.
