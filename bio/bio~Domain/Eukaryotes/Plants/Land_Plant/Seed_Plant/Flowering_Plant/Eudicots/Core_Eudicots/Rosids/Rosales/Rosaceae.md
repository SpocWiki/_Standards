> **Rosaceae**, the rose family, is a family of flowering plants 
> that includes 4,828 known species in 91 genera.
>
> The name is derived from the type genus Rosa. The family includes herbs, shrubs, and trees. 
> Most species are deciduous, but some are evergreen. 
> They have a worldwide range but are most diverse in the Northern Hemisphere.
>
> Many economically important products come from the Rosaceae, including various edible fruits, 
> such as [[Rosaceae/Apple|apples]], [[Rosaceae/Pear|pears]], [[Rosaceae/Quince|quinces]], [[Rosaceae/Apricot|apricots]], [[Rosaceae/Plum|plums]], [[Rosaceae/Cherry|cherries]], [[Rosaceae/Peach|peaches]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[Rosaceae/Blackberry|blackberries]], 
> loquats, [[Rosaceae/Strawberry|strawberries]], rose hips, hawthorns, and [[Rosaceae/Almond|almonds]]. 
> 
> The family also includes popular ornamental trees and shrubs, 
> such as roses, meadowsweets, rowans, firethorns, and photinias.
>
> Among the most species-rich genera in the family are 
> - Alchemilla (270), 
> - Sorbus (260), 
> - Crataegus (260), 
> - Cotoneaster (260), 
> - Rubus (250), and 
> - Prunus (200), which contains the [[Rosaceae/Plum|plums]], [[Rosaceae/Cherry|cherries]], [[Rosaceae/Peach|peaches]], apricots, and [[Rosaceae/Almond|almonds]]. 
> 
> However, all of these numbers should be seen as estimatesâ€”much taxonomic work remains.
