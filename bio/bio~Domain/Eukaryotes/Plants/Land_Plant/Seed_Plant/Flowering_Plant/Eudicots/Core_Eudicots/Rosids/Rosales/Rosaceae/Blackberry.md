## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Blackberry** is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus 
> in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among these species within the subgenus Rubus, 
> and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. 
> 
> The taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and 
> apomixis so that species have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.
>
> Blackberry fruit production is abundant 
> with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha) possible, 
> making this plant commercially attractive.
>
> Rubus armeniacus ("Himalayan" blackberry) is considered a noxious weed 
> and invasive species in many regions of the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States, 
> where it grows out of control in urban and suburban parks and woodlands.
