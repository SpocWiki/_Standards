## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **sandalwood** is a class of woods from trees in the genus Santalum. 
> The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, 
> unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. 
> 
> Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods. 
> Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. 
> 
> Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. 
> 
> Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past.
