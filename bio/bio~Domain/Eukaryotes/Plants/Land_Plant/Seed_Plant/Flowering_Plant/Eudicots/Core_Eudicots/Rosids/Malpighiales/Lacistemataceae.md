## Introduction

[Mac H. Alford](http://www.tolweb.org/)

Lacistemataceae are a small neotropical family consisting of two genera
and 14 species. The family is characterized by catkin-like cylindrical
spikes or spiciform racemes, minute apetalous flowers with a single
stamen (usually with an expanded connective), and parietal placentation.

Traditionally, the family has been allied with Salicaceae or
Flacourtiaceae. Lacistemataceae were treated as tribe Lacistemeae in
Sleumer\'s (1980) monograph of all neotropical Flacourtiaceae, a family
now split mostly among Achariaceae, Salicaceae, and Samydaceae.\

### Characteristics

*Shrubs* or *small trees*. *Leaves* alternate, stipulate, blades
pinnately veined, margins entire to denticulate or serrate.
*Inflorescences* axillary spiciform racemes or catkin-like cylindrical
spikes. *Flowers* minute, bisexual (or polygamous), each flower
subtended by a bract. *Sepals* one to six. *Petals* lacking. *Disk*
present. *Stamen* one, attached to the inner surface of disk, anther
dehiscence introrse. *Gynoecium* of one pistil, ovary superior,
unilocular, placentation parietal, ovules anatropous, style short or
long, stigmas (two or) three. *Fruit* berry-like, but eventually
dehiscent by three loculicidal valves. *Seeds* one or few, arillate,
embryo straight, cotyledons foliaceous.
