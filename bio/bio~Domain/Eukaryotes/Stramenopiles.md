### Introduction

This grouping of protists arose largely from molecular studies which
categorically confirmed that algae (previously referred to as
Heterokonts or Chrysophytes) were related to a variety of non algal
protists - such as the heterotrophic bicosoecid flagellates and the
fungal oomycetes (Leipe et al, 1994). The group was informally named by
Patterson (1989) and was based at that time on cytological evidence. The
hairs which define this group are a distinctive subset of hairs
encountered in protists, and are distinguished by having a long hollow
shaft that gives rise to a small number of fine hairs, and the entire
structure inserts into the cell by a basal region. These hairs usually
occur on the flagella. A number of supposed stramenopiles are thought
(opalines) or known (diatoms) to have lost the hairs. The stramenopiles
is a very major grouping of eukaryotes containing some organisms with
the largest linear dimensions known in the eukaryotic world (brown
algae), as well as ecologically very important organisms - such as the
diatoms.

### Characteristics

Tubulocristate protists with tripartite tubular hairs or derived from
such organisms.
