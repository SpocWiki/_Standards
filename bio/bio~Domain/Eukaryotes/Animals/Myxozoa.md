# [[Myxozoa]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Myxozoa** (etymology: Greek: μύξα myxa "slime" or "mucus" + o + ζῷον zoon "animal") 
> is a subphylum of aquatic cnidarian animals – all obligate parasites. 
> 
> It contains the smallest animals ever known to have lived. 
> Over 2,180 species have been described 
> and some estimates have suggested at least 30,000 undiscovered species. 
> 
> Many have a two-host lifecycle, involving a fish and an annelid worm or a bryozoan. 
> The average size of a myxosporean spore usually ranges from 10 μm to 20 μm, 
> whereas that of a malacosporean (a subclade of the Myxozoa) spore can be up to 2 mm. 
> Myxozoans can live in both freshwater and marine habitats.
>
> Myxozoans are highly derived cnidarians that have undergone dramatic 
> evolution from a free swimming, self-sufficient jellyfish-like creature 
> into their current form of obligate parasites composed of very few cells. 
> 
> As myxozoans evolved into microscopic parasites, 
> they lost many genes responsible for multicellular development, coordination, 
> cell–cell communication, and even, in some cases, aerobic respiration. 
> 
> The genomes of some myxozoans are now among the smallest genomes of any known animal species.
