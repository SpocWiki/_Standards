Classification from Wells (1956), as modified by Stolarski (1996). The
family marked with a cross (![](Eukaryotes/Animals/Cnidaria/Anthozoa/Zoantharia/Scleractinia/Caryophylliina/Caryophyllioidea/extinct_002.gif){height="9" width="7"}
) occurs only in the fossil record, whereas the other 3 families contain
both fossil and Recent taxa.

Containing group: [Caryophylliina](Caryophylliina.md)

### Introduction

Representatives of this family occur from the early Jurassic (about 180
million years ago) to the Recent, and are widespread in the world
oceans, commonly being found as fossils on all continents, including
Antarctica (Filkorn, 1994). One hundred sixteen genera have been
described, most of which (73 genera and 347 species) occur in the Recent
(Cairns et al., 1999). Most are azooxanthellate (86% of the genera) and
solitary in growth form (63% of the genera). Although colonies may reach
a meter or more in size, most caryophyllioideans are small, rarely
greater than 20-30 mm in size. Although several genera in this
superfamily are colonial reef builders, most are inconspicuous,
occurring cryptically in shallow-water environments or as benthos on the
lower shelf and upper slope (0-2165 m).

### Characteristics

The superfamily is characterized by having coralla with a septothecal
(constructed of thickening of septa) or parathecal (constructed of
dissepiments) trabecular wall in the adult stage. Nontrabecular epitheca
(rare) or textura (more common) may overlay the original wall, and
granulated costae are usually present (Stolarski, 1995).

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

No phylogenetic analysis has been done on the suprageneric taxa of the
Caryophyllioidea; however, Stolarski (1995, 1996), Romano and Palumbi
(1996), and Romano and Cairns (2000) are currently investigating and
reassessing the higher level relationships in this superfamily by using
characteristics of the corallum microstructure and DNA sequences,
respectively.
