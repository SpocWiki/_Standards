### Characteristics

Gonactiniidae with smooth, cylindrical body. Margin not undulated.
Column with well developed longitudinal muscles and nerve-stratum.
Tentacles rather long, few, not constricted at their base, not swollen
at the apex. Usually 8 mesenteries perfect but in connection with
reproduction by transverse fisison \[sic\] the number of perfect
mesenteries may be a little irregular. Imperfect mesenteries 8, four
forming pairs with the perfect mesenteries, and four forming two pairs
in the dorsolateral exocoels. Only the lateral perfect mesenteries
fertile, the perfect mesenteries and sometimes the fifth couple with
filaments. Longitudinal muscles of the mesenteries and the
parietobasilar muscles weak. Reproduction by transverse fission. Cnidom:
see the family.
