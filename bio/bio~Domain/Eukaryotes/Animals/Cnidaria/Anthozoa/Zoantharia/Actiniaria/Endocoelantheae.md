### Characteristics

Actiniaria with well-developed pedal disc but without basilar muscles.
Column without vesicles and verrucae, nearly always with spirocysts.
Margin tentaculate. No sphincter. Tentacles in variable number, often
with their aboral side thickened, either in two alternating cycles or,
owing to the curious development of the mesenteries, arranged in a way
very different from the normal type, but usually in cycles. Longitudinal
muscles of tentacles and radial muscles of oral disc ectodermal, with a
slight mesogloeal tendency. Oral disc sometimes lobed. One siphonoglyph
or two. Usually more mesenteries than the directives attached to the
siphonoglyph. Arrangement of the mesenteries curious. After the first 12
mesenteries (six couples) are developed, all subsequent pairs appear in
the lateral endocoels and have their longitudinal muscles oriented as in
the directives. Cnidom: spirocysts, basitrichs, microbasic
p-mastigophors.
