## Introduction

[Keith A. Crandall and James W. Fetzner, Jr.]() 

Freshwater crayfishes are taxonomically distributed among three
families; two Northern Hemisphere families, Astacidae and Cambaridae and
one Southern Hemisphere family, Parastacidae. There are two centers of
species diversity for freshwater crayfishes. The first is located in the
Southeastern United States where some 80% of the cambarid species can be
found. The second center of diversity is in Victoria, Australia; housing
a large proportion of the parastacid species. Freshwater crayfishes
naturally occur on all of the continents except Africa (Figure 1). The
Astacidae are distributed West of the Rocky Mountains in the Northwest
United States into British Columbia, Canada and in Europe. The
Cambaridae are found in the Eastern United States and south through
Mexico. The Parastacidae are distributed in Australia, New Zealand,
South America, and Madagascar.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

The phylogenetic relationships among the freshwater crayfish families
and their relationships to lobster-like ancestors has been of
considerable debate for at least 100 years. Two alternative hypotheses
have been proposed for the origins of crayfishes. The first supposes a
diphyletic origin of astacoids and parastacoids suggesting independent
invasion of the freshwater habitat (Huxley, 1880). This idea is
supported by the two centers of diversity in the northern and southern
hemispheres and by a number of morphological features (Hobbs, 1974).
However, Ortmann (1902) argued for a monophyletic origin of the
crayfishes. This position has recently been supported by sperm
ultrastructure characteristics (Jamieson, 1991) and by embryonic
characters (Scholtz, 1993). Because of this ongoing debate, the
positioning of Parastacidae is shown as unresolved.
