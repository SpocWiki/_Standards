> The **Cambaridae** are the largest of the four families of freshwater crayfish, 
> with over 400 species. 
> 
> Most of the species in the family are native to the United States east of the Great Divide 
> and Mexico, but fewer range north to Canada, and south to Guatemala and Honduras. 
> 
> Three live on the island of Cuba. 
> The species in the genus Cambaroides are only found outside North America, 
> as they are restricted to eastern Asia.
>
> A few species, including the invasive Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius rusticus, 
> have been introduced to regions far outside their native range 
> (both in North America and other continents). 
> 
> Conversely, many species have tiny ranges and are seriously threatened; a few are already extinct.
>
> A 2006 molecular study suggested that the family Cambaridae may be paraphyletic, 
> with the family Astacidae nested within it, 
> and the status of the genus Cambaroides remains unclear.
>
> The oldest fossils of the family are 
> known from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of western North America.
