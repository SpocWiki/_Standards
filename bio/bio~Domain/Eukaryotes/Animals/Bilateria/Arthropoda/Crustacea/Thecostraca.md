# [[Thecostraca]] 

Barnacles and their relatives 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Thecostraca** is a class of marine invertebrates containing over 2,200 described species. 
> Many species have planktonic larvae which become sessile or parasitic as adults.
>
> The most prevalent subgroup are the barnacles (subclass Cirripedia), 
> constituting a little over 2,100 known species.
>
> The subgroup Facetotecta contains a single genus, Hansenocaris, 
> known only from the tiny planktonic nauplii called "y-larvae". 
> 
> These larvae have no known adult form, though it is suspected that they are parasites, 
> and their affinity is uncertain. 
> 
> Some researchers believe that they may be larval tantulocaridans. 
> No larval tantulocaridans are currently known.
>
> The group Ascothoracida contains about 110 species, 
> all parasites of coelenterates and echinoderms.
>
> The nauplius larvae (sometimes absent) can be both lecithotrophic (non-feeding) 
> and planktotrophic (feeding), and is followed by a larval stage called the cyprid, 
> which is always lecithotrophic. 
> 
> The cypridoid larvae are referred to as the y-cyprid in the Facetotecta, 
> the a-cyprid in the Ascothoracida, and the c-cyprid, or just cyprid, in the Cirripedia.
