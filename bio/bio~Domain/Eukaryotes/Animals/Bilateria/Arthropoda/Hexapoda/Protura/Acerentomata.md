## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Protura, or proturans, and sometimes nicknamed coneheads, 
> are very small (0.6–1.5mm long), soil-dwelling animals, 
> so inconspicuous they were not noticed until the 20th century. 
> 
> The Protura constitute an order of hexapods that were 
> previously regarded as insects, 
> and sometimes treated as a class in their own right.
>
> Some evidence indicates the Protura are basal to all other hexapods, 
> although not all researchers consider them Hexapoda, 
> rendering the monophyly of Hexapoda unsettled. 
> 
> Uniquely among hexapods, proturans show anamorphic development, 
> whereby body segments are added during moults.
>
> There are close to 800 species, described in seven families. 
> Nearly 300 species are contained in a single genus, Eosentomon.
