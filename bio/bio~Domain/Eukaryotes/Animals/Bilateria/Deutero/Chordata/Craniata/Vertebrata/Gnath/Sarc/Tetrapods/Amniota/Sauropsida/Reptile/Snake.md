# [[Snake]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Snake**s are elongated limbless reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. 
> Cladistically squamates, snakes are ectothermic, 
> amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales much like other members of the group. 
> 
> Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors 
> and relatives, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). 
> 
> To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) 
> appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. 
> Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. 
> Lizards have independently evolved elongate bodies without limbs 
> or with greatly reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution, 
> leading to many lineages of legless lizards. 
> These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids 
> and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal 
> (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).
>
> Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; 
> exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, 
> and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans. 
> Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. 
> Around thirty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera 
> and about more than 4,170 species. 
> They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake 
> to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length. 
> The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long. 
> 
> Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, 
> perhaps during the Jurassic period, 
> with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago. 
> The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch 
> (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). 
> The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
>
> Most species of snake are nonvenomous 
> and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. 
> Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. 
> Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
