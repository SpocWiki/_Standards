> It contains one extant genus with four species, all exclusively from South America: 
> - llamas, 
> - alpacas, 
> - vicuÃ±as, and 
> - guanacos. 
> 
> The former two are domesticated species, while the latter two are only found in the wild. 
> None display sexual dimorphism. 
> The four species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. 
> Additionally, there are several extinct genera.
