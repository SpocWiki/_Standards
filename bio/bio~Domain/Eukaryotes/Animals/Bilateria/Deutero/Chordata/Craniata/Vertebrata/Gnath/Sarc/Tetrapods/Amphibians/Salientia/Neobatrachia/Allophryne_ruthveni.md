> The Tukeit Hill frogs are three species of frog in the genus Allophryne. Originally erected for the species **Allophryne ruthveni**, the genus was placed as the only member of the subfamily Allophryninae, which was in turn placed in the family Centrolenidae, but they are now considered as the only genus in the monotypic family Allophrynidae.
>
> These frogs live in Guyana, Venezuela, Suriname, Brazil and Bolivia.  The holotype was discovered at Tukeit Hill, below Kaieteur Falls, Guyana, hence the common English name.

## Introduction

[David Cannatella](http://www.tolweb.org/)

Allophryne ruthveni is an enigmatic frog from the Guyanan region of
South America. It is about 25-30 mm in snout-vent length, and calls from
trees. Its skin is covered with evenly spaced, pointed spicules.
Superficially, it resembles a hylid, but all hylids have claw-shaped
terminal phalanges. The terminal phalanges of Allophryne are T-shaped.
There are no fossils.

### Phylogenetic Position of Allophryne ruthveni

The monophyly of Hylidae is questionable if Allophryne ruthveni is
included. Although originally described as a leptodactylid (then called
bufonids), Noble (1931) considered Allophryne to be an edentate
Centrolenella, and thus transferred it to Hylidae, which at that time
included centrolenids. An intercalary cartilage was a feature of
Noble\'s Hylidae; his placement of Allophryne here indicated that this
frog possessed such an element. Lynch and Freeman (1966), with
reservation, referred Allophryne to Hylidae. Savage (1973) recognized a
monotypic family Allophrynidae without explanation. Duellman (1975)
reported that males call from vegetation over a pond, and that pigmented
eggs were deposited in the water. He concluded that these characters
supported placement in Hylidae. However, the oviposition site is
plesiomorphic for Neobatrachia, and the male calling site is present in
other treefrog groups such as centrolenids and hyperoliids. Laurent
(1979) offered that Allophryne was a bufonid, but did not offer explicit
evidence to support this. This placement was followed uncritically by
Dubois (1984) and unfortunately found its way into a general treatment
of amphibians (Halliday and Adler, 1986).

Inclusion of Allophryne in Hylidae rests largely on the presence of
intercalary cartilages. Ford and Cannatella (1993) reported that they
examined the fingers and toes of Allophryne in serial sections, and
concluded that Allophryne cannot be characterized as having
cartilaginous intercalary elements as occur in hylids and centrolenids
(Howes and Davies, 1888). Allophryne has T-shaped, rather than
claw-shaped, terminal phalanges. No hylids have T-shaped terminal
phalanges, but these are present in many other groups, including
Heleophryne, arthroleptines, eleutherodactyliines, dendrobatids, and
hylodines (=elosiines), among others (Ford, 1989b). Ford and Cannatella
(1993) concluded that the available data indicate only that Allophryne
is a hyloid; the placement of Allophryne in any higher taxon except for
Neobatrachia is misleading.
