# [[Therapsida]]

Mammals and extinct relatives 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Therapsida** is a clade comprising a major group of eupelycosaurian synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors and close relatives. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including limbs that were oriented more underneath the body, resulting in a more "standing" quadrupedal posture, as opposed to the lower sprawling posture of many reptiles and amphibians.
>
> Therapsids evolved from earlier synapsids commonly called "pelycosaurs", specifically within the Sphenacodontia, more than 279.5 million years ago. They replaced the pelycosaurs as the dominant large land animals in the Guadalupian through to the Early Triassic. In the aftermath of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, therapsids declined in relative importance to the rapidly diversifying archosaurian sauropsids (pseudosuchians, dinosaurs and pterosaurs, etc.) during the Middle Triassic.

> The therapsids include the cynodonts, the group that gave rise to mammals (Mammaliaformes) in the Late Triassic around 225 million years ago, the only therapsid clade that survived beyond the end of the Triassic. The only other group of therapsids to have survived into the Late Triassic, the dicynodonts, became extinct towards the end of the period. The last surviving group of non-mammaliaform cynodonts were the Tritylodontidae, which became extinct during the Early Cretaceous.

Therapsida is a group of synapsids, which are a lineage of tetrapods 
that includes mammals and their extinct relatives. 
The parent group of Therapsida is the class [[Synapsida]], which also includes pelycosaurs, 
a group of early synapsids that lived before the appearance of therapsids. 

The transition from pelycosaurs to therapsids marked 
an important evolutionary shift toward mammal-like characteristics. 

## Characteristics 

Here are some key differences between Therapsida and their parent group:

### Temporal Fenestration: 
One of the most significant differences between pelycosaurs and therapsids is the 
development of temporal fenestration in the skull. 
Temporal fenestrae are __openings in the skull behind the eye sockets__, 
and they are associated with muscle attachment points. 
In therapsids, the temporal fenestrae became larger and more pronounced, 
allowing for the attachment of larger jaw muscles. 
This is considered a key feature of mammal-like reptiles and eventually mammals.

### Dental Differentiation: 
Therapsids exhibit greater dental differentiation compared to pelycosaurs. 
This includes the development of specialized teeth for different functions, 
such as incisors for cutting, canines for puncturing and tearing, and molars for grinding food. 
This dental differentiation reflects adaptations for a more varied diet 
and increased efficiency in food processing.

### Secondary Palate: 
Many therapsids developed a secondary palate, 
a bony structure that separates the nasal passages from the oral cavity. 
The presence of a secondary palate allows for simultaneous breathing and chewing, 
which is an adaptation seen in mammals. 
This separation of respiratory and digestive passages is essential 
for maintaining a constant flow of air to the lungs during chewing and swallowing.

### Posture and Gait: 
Therapsids exhibit modifications in posture and gait compared to pelycosaurs. 
They have more erect limbs positioned beneath the body, 
which is indicative of a more efficient stance for terrestrial locomotion. 
This change in posture is a step toward the more upright stance seen in mammals, 
which is characterized by a more efficient gait for sustained locomotion.

### Endothermy and Metabolism: 
While endothermy (the ability to generate internal body heat) likely evolved gradually 
within the synapsid lineage, many therapsids show evidence of increased metabolic rates 
compared to their pelycosaur ancestors. 
This metabolic shift may have been facilitated by adaptations 
such as an enlarged temporal fenestra and improved respiratory systems, 
which allowed for greater oxygen intake and more efficient energy production.

Overall, the transition from pelycosaurs to therapsids 
represented a significant step toward the evolution of mammal-like characteristics. 
These differences reflect adaptations for a more active and energy-efficient lifestyle, 
setting the stage for the eventual emergence of true mammals.
