> The tetrapods, a mostly terrestrial clade of vertebrates, are now recognized as having evolved from sarcopterygian ancestors and are most closely related to lungfishes. Their paired pectoral and pelvic fins evolved into limbs, and their foregut diverticulum eventually evolved into air-breathing lungs. Cladistically, this would make the tetrapods a subgroup within Sarcopterygii and thus sarcopterygians themselves. As a result, the phrase "lobe-finned fish" normally refers to not the entire clade but only aquatic members that are not tetrapods, i.e. a paraphyletic group.

The only known extant non-tetrapod sarcopterygians are the two species of coelacanths and six species of lungfishes.

## The lobe-finned fishes & terrestrial vertebrates 

![ ](Sarc/Latimeria35531239_a870f7a78.jpg)
Sarcopterygii, or lobe-finned fish, are distinguished 
from their parent group within the superclass [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish) 
by several key anatomical and evolutionary features. Here are some of the main differences:

## Characteristics 
### Fleshy, Lobed Fins: 
Sarcopterygian fish have paired fins that are fleshy 
and supported by a series of bones, known as lobes. 
These lobed fins are more muscular and articulated 
than the ray-finned fins found in their parent group. 
The presence of lobed fins is considered a key evolutionary innovation 
that eventually led to the emergence of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates).

### Rhipidistians: 
The subclass Rhipidistia, which includes extinct lobe-finned fish 
such as Eusthenopteron and Tiktaalik, 
represents the evolutionary transition from fish to tetrapods. 
Rhipidistians possessed many characteristics intermediate between fish and tetrapods, 
including robust fins with bones homologous to those of tetrapod limbs.

### Lungfish and Coelacanths: 

Modern sarcopterygian fish include two extant groups: lungfish and coelacanths. 
Lungfish are known for their ability to breathe air using primitive lungs, in addition to gills, 
allowing them to survive in oxygen-poor water or even burrow into mud during dry periods. 

[[Coelacanth]]s are deep-sea fish that were thought to be extinct 
until living specimens were discovered in the 20th century. 
Both lungfish and coelacanths exhibit primitive characteristics 
reminiscent of early sarcopterygians.

### Internal Nostrils: 

Sarcopterygian fish typically have internal nostrils (choanae) 
that connect the nasal passages to the mouth cavity. 
This adaptation is associated with the ability to smell and taste underwater 
without inhaling water into the respiratory system.

### Axial Skeleton: 
Sarcopterygians often have a strong, ossified axial skeleton (vertebral column) 
that provides support and protection for internal organs. 
This axial skeleton is a characteristic feature of [[osteichthyans]] (bony fish) 
but may be more pronounced in sarcopterygians.

### Paired Fins with Muscular Strands: 

The paired fins of sarcopterygians have a unique structure, 
with muscular strands connecting the fin rays to the body. 
This musculature allows for greater control and flexibility of the fins, 
facilitating more precise movements 
and potentially contributing to the locomotor abilities of early tetrapods.

Overall, sarcopterygian fish represent an important evolutionary lineage 
within the superclass [[Osteichthyes]], 
characterized by the presence of lobed fins and other adaptations 
that played a crucial role in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

There is much debate on the interrelationships of sarcopterygian fishes
(for an introduction to the literature see Nelson, 1994, Carroll, 1988,
and Takezaki et al. 2004). Additional information on sarcopterygians
including tetrapods is being assembled for the Tree of Life project by
several contributors.
