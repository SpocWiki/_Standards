# Vieraella herbsti

The Oldest True Frog 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Vieraella is an extinct genus of frogs from the Lower Jurassic (Early Pliensbachian to Toarcian) Roca Blanca Formation of Argentina, and one of the oldest true frogs known. This genus is known by a single exceptionally well-preserved specimen, P.V.L. 2188, with at least eight presacrals vertebrae, free ribs, ulna and radius not fused, bony skull with some discoglossid characters.

## Introduction

[David Cannatella](http://www.tolweb.org/)

Vieraella herbsti, from the Early Jurassic (188-213 my), is the earliest
record of what most of us think of as a true frog. It is known only from
the dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal. The dorsal part
was found in 1961 by Rafael Herbst in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.
The ventral impression (counterpart) was found just a few years later by
the noted paleontologist Casamiquela. Estes and Reig (1973) reviewed the
fossil material.

The frog is estimated to be 33 mm in snout-vent length. This fossil has
been recently re-described by Báez and Basso (ms), who interpret the
frog as having ten presacral vertebrae. Their phylogenetic analysis
places it more basal than Notobatrachus + living frogs (Anura).

Ford and Cannatella (1993) defined Anura as a node-based name for the
ancestor (most recent) of living frogs and all its descendants. This was
done in part to associate the name with a stable taxonomic content. By
this definition, then, Vieraella is not part of Anura, although it is
part of the larger group Salientia.
