> Triadobatrachus is an extinct genus of salientian frog-like amphibians, including only one known species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. It is the oldest member of the frog lineage known, and an excellent example of a transitional fossil. It lived during the Early Triassic about 250 million years ago, in what is now Madagascar.

> Triadobatrachus was 10 cm (3.9 in) long, and still retained many primitive characteristics, such as possessing at least 26 vertebrae, where modern frogs have only four to nine. At least 10 of these vertebrae formed a short tail, which the animal may have retained as an adult. It probably swam by kicking its hind legs, although it could not jump, as most modern frogs can. Its skull resembled that of modern frogs, consisting of a latticework of thin bones separated by large openings.

The animal must have fossilized soon after its death, because all bones lay in their natural anatomical position. Only the anterior part of the skull and the ends of the limbs were missing. This fossil was initially described under the name Protobatrachus massinoti by the French paleontologist Jean Piveteau in 1936. Much more detailed description were published more recently.

Its proximity to the mainland is further borne out by the remains of terrestrial plants found with it, and because most extant amphibians do not tolerate saltwater, and that this saltwater intolerance was probably present in the earliest lissamphibians.

## Introduction

[David Cannatella](http://www.tolweb.org/)

The earliest known salientian is †Triadobatrachus massinoti, from the
Early Triassic of Madagascar. This \"proto-frog\" is about 250 million
years old. We call it that because it had not yet quite evolved to the
combination of features that we think of as being associated with frogs.
For example, †Triadobatrachus had 14 vertebrae in front of the sacrum,
and had a short tail, with the tail vertebrae separate from each other.
In Triadobatrachus the radius and ulna (bones of the forearm) were not
fused to each other; neither were the tibia and fibula (bones of the
shank). The tibiale and fibulare of †Triadobatrachus may be slightly
elongate, but not nearly to the degree seen in frogs. However, features
that clearly link †Triadobatrachus to frogs are an anteriorly directed
ilium, reduction in number of presacral vertebrae (to 14), fusion of the
frontal and parietal into a frontoparietal bone, and a toothless dentary
bone in the lower jaw. There is a large morphological gap between frogs
and salamanders, and †Triadobatrachus has many of the features that you
would expect from an organism that is intermediate between the two. This
taxon is known from a single specimen. It was recently re-studied by
Rage and Rocek (1989).
