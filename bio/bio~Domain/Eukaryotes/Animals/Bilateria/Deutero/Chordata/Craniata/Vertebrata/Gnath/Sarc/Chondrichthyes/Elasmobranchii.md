> **Elasmobranchii** is a subclass of Chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish, 
> including modern sharks (division Selachii), 
> and batomorphs (division Batomorphi, including rays, skates, and sawfish). 
> 
> Members of this subclass are characterised by having five to seven pairs of gill slits 
> opening individually to the exterior, rigid dorsal fins and small placoid scales on the skin. 
> 
> The teeth are in several series; the upper jaw is not fused to the cranium, 
> and the lower jaw is articulated with the upper. 
> The details of this jaw anatomy vary between species, 
> and help distinguish the different elasmobranch clades. 
> 
> The pelvic fins in males are modified to create claspers for the transfer of sperm. 
> There is no swim bladder; instead, these fish maintain buoyancy with large livers rich in oil.
>
> The definition of the clade is unclear with respect to fossil chondrichthyans. 
> Some authors consider it as equivalent to Neoselachii (the crown group clade 
> including modern sharks, rays, and all other descendants of their last common ancestor). 
> Other authors use the name Elasmobranchii for a broader branch-based group of all chondrichthyans more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to Holocephali 
> (the clade containing chimaeras and their extinct relatives). 
> 
> Important extinct groups of elasmobranchs sensu lato include the 
> - hybodonts (Order Hybodontiformes), 
> - xenacanths (order Xenacanthformes) and 
> - Ctenacanthiformes. 
> These are also often referred to as "sharks" in reference to their similar anatomy and ecology to modern sharks.
>
> The name Elasmobranchii comes from the Ancient Greek words elasmo- ("plate") 
> and brÃ¡nchia ("gill"), referring to the broad, flattened gills which are characteristic of these fishes.
