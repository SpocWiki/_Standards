> **Atlanta** (  at-LAN-tə) is the capital and most populous city in the U.S. state of Georgia. It is the seat of Fulton County and extends into neighboring DeKalb County.  With a population of 520,070 (2024 estimate) living within the city limits, Atlanta is the eighth most populous city in the Southeast and 36th most populous city in the United States according to the 2020 U.S. census. Atlanta is classified as a Beta + global city and is the principal city of the much larger Atlanta metropolitan area, the core of which includes  Cobb, Clayton and Gwinnett counties, in addition to Fulton and DeKalb. Metro Atlanta is home to more than 6.4 million people (2024 estimate), making it the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan area. Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, Atlanta features unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States.

> Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The largest was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name "Atlanta" is derived, signifying the city's growing reputation as a major hub of transportation. During the American Civil War, it served a strategically important role for the Confederacy until it was captured in 1864. The city was almost entirely burned to the ground during General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. However, the city rebounded dramatically in the post-war period and quickly became a national industrial center and the unofficial capital of the "New South". After World War II, it also became a manufacturing and technology hub. During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and many other locals becoming prominent figures in the movement's leadership. In the modern era, Atlanta has remained a major center of transportation, with Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport becoming the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998 (a position it has held every year since, except for 2020), with an estimated 93.7 million passengers in 2022.

> With a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $473 billion in 2021, Atlanta has the 11th-largest economy among cities in the U.S. and the 22nd-largest in the world. Its economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors in industries including transportation, aerospace, logistics, healthcare, news and media operations, film and television production, information technology, finance, and biomedical research and public policy. Atlanta established itself on the world stage when it won and hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Games impacted Atlanta's development growth into the 21st century, and significantly sparked investment in the city's universities, parks, and tourism industry. The gentrification of some of its neighborhoods has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline. This has altered its demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.

## Introduction

[Roger R. Seapy]() 

***Atlanta*** is the type genus of the **Atlantidae**, containing 20 of
the 22 species in the family (the other two genera, ***Protatlanta***
and ***Oxygyrus***, are monospecific). All species but one (***A.
californiensis*** from the temperate North Pacific) are found in
tropical to subtropical waters. Most (12) are cosmopolitan in geographic
distribution, although three are Indo-Pacific, two are found only in the
Indian Ocean, two only in the Atlantic Ocean, and one in the Pacific
Ocean.

#### Diagnosis

An atlantid with:

-   Shell and keel calcareous.

### Characteristics

1.  Shell and keel calcareous.
2.  Spiral portion of operculum present.

#### Comments

Species in the genus ***Atlanta*** can be grouped together (into species
groups) by several morphological features:

1.  Eye types. Three eye morphologies (termed types a, b and c; after
    Richter, 1961) are present that differ primarily in patterns of
    pigmentation. Types a and b have a large part of the eye wall that
    lacks pigment forming a window. These two eye types differ in the
    absence (type a) or presence (type b) of a narrow transverse slit
    (extension of the distal part of the window) that almost completely
    separates distal from proximal pigmentation. Type c lacks a window.

    helicinoides*** Hawaiian waters . A representative photograph of an
    animal with a Type a eye is not available. Photographs copyright ©

2.  Operculum types. Three operculum types (termed Types a, b, c; after
    Richter, 1961) are found in ***Atlanta***. The third type (c)
    differs from the first two (a and b) in the number of turns of the
    spiral (larval) gyre; \"single\" in the mono-gyre and \"a few\" in
    the oligo-gyre opercula. The two types of oligogyre opercula differ
    in the relative size of the gyre region; hence, the prefixes macro-
    and micro-.

    blue. Drawing modified from Richter and Seapy (1999).

3.  Spire whorl number. The shell of **Atlanta** consists of three
    sequentially-deposited portions; a dome-shaped embryonic shell
    (protoconch I), a larval shell (protoconch II) and the adult shell
    (teleoconch). In postmetamorphic animals, the number of whorls
    comprising the teleoconch increases with growth, while the number of
    whorls in the protoconch (forming the spire of the adult shell) is
    constant. The location on the shell where the protoconch ends and
    the teleoconch begins is often difficult to determine, but its
    approximate location is necessary in determining the number of
    whorls comprising the shell spire. The number of spire whorls varies
    between two and one-half and six among ***Atlanta*** species.

    (protoconch II) is shaded blue. **Right**: Adult shell of ***Atlanta
    plana***, Hawaiian waters. Scale bar = 0.5 mm. The embryonic and
    larval shells are colored blue to distinguish them from the
    remainder of the shell. Scanning electron micrographs copyright ©

The 20 species of ***Atlanta*** are combined into seven species groups
(Richter and Seapy, 1999). The groups are each characterized by
similarities in overall shell and shell spire morphologies, and in some
cases body coloration. In addition, members of each group usually share
the same opercular type and, in many cases, the same eye type. The table
below summarizes this information.

\*One species, ***Atlanta peresi***, was described by Frontier (1966)
from the western Indian Ocean. Although its adult shell morphology and
opercular type were characterized by Frontier, its eye and radular
morphologies are unknown. Subsequent studies of the atlantid heteropods
from the Indian Ocean by Richter (1974) and Seapy et al. (2003) did not
record the species, and the species\' validity remains in question. The
interested reader is referred to Richter and Seapy (1999) for a further
description and discussion.
