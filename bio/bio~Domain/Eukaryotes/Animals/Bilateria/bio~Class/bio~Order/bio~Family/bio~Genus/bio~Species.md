## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Species** (pl.: species) is a population of organisms 
> in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or __mating types can produce fertile offspring__, 
> typically by sexual reproduction. 
> 
> It is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism, as well as a unit of biodiversity. 
> Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour, or ecological niche. 
> 
> In addition, palaeontologists use the concept of the chronospecies 
> since fossil reproduction cannot be examined. 
> 
> The most recent rigorous estimate for the total number of species of eukaryotes is between 8 and 8.7 million. 
> About 14% of these had been described by 2011. 
> 
> All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name, called a "binomial". 
> The first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs. 
> The second part is called the specific name or the specific epithet 
> (in botanical nomenclature, also sometimes in zoological nomenclature). 
> For example, Boa constrictor is one of the species of the genus Boa, 
> with constrictor being the species' epithet.
>
> While the definitions given above may seem adequate at first glance, 
> when looked at more closely they represent problematic species concepts. 
> 
> For example, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with hybridisation, 
> in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, and in a ring species. 
> 
> Also, among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, 
> and each clone is potentially a microspecies. 
> 
> Although none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions, 
> and while the concept of species may not be a perfect model of life, 
> it is still a useful tool to scientists and conservationists for studying life on Earth. 
> If species were fixed and distinct from one another, there would be no problem, 
> but evolutionary processes cause species to change. 
> 
> This obliges taxonomists to decide, for example, when enough change has occurred 
> to declare that a lineage should be divided into multiple chronospecies, 
> or when populations have diverged to have enough distinct character states to be described as cladistic species.
>
> Species and higher taxa were seen from the time of Aristotle until the 18th century 
> as categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the great chain of being. 
> 
> In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time. 
> Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species explained how species could arise by natural selection. 
> That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology. 
> 
> Genetic variability arises from mutations and recombination, while organisms themselves are mobile, 
> leading to geographical isolation and genetic drift with varying selection pressures. 
> 
> Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by horizontal gene transfer; 
> new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and polyploidy; 
> and species may become extinct for a variety of reasons. 
> 
> Viruses are a special case, driven by a balance of mutation and selection, and can be treated as quasispecies.
