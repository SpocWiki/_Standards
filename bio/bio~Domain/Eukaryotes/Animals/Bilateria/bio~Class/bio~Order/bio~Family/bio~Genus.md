> **Genus** (pl.: genera ) is a taxonomic rank above species and below family 
> as used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms as well as viruses. 
> 
> In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name 
> for each species within the genus.
> 
> E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar) are two species within the genus Panthera. 
> Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae.
>
> The composition of a genus is determined by taxonomists. 
> The standards for genus classification are not strictly codified, 
> so different authorities often produce different classifications for genera. 
> 
> There are some general practices used, however, 
> including the idea that a newly defined genus should fulfill these three criteria to be descriptively useful:
> 1. monophyly – all descendants of an ancestral taxon are grouped together 
>    (i.e. phylogenetic analysis should clearly demonstrate both monophyly and validity as a separate lineage).
> 2. reasonable compactness – a genus should not be expanded needlessly. 
> 3. distinctness – with respect to evolutionarily relevant criteria, i.e. ecology, morphology, or biogeography; 
> 
> DNA sequences are a consequence rather than a condition of diverging evolutionary lineages 
> except in cases where they directly inhibit gene flow (e.g. postzygotic barriers).
>
> Moreover, genera should be composed of phylogenetic units of the same kind as other (analogous) genera.
