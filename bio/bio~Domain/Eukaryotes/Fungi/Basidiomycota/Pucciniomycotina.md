### Introduction

Members of the class Urediniomycetes are remarkably diverse, possessing
a wide range of structural and ecological characters. One characteristic
many of these fungi have in common, however, is their rather miniscule
size, making them challenging to locate and study. The apparent lack of
unifying structural features of many members of the Urediniomycetes has
presented a challenge to understanding their phylogenetic affiliations,
and the relationships of many of these disparate taxa have been
illuminated since 1995 through the acquisition of molecular sequence,
biochemical and subcellular data.

The class contains approximately 7,400 species, distributed among
approximately 215 genera, but will eventually be much larger as many
cryptic species are recognized. More than 95% of the species and 75% of
the genera in this class are placed in the Uredinales, the plant
parasitic rust fungi. The next largest orders, Septobasidiales and
Microbotryales, collectively constitute approximately 5% of the species
and 4% of the genera. Nearly 20% of the rust genera and 60% of the
nonrust genera are monotypic (containing only one species). The rust
fungi and several of the yeasts have been more extensively studied than
have other taxa, and the surprisingly large percentage of monotypic
genera may be artificially high due to the limited research on these
often obscure fungi.

The rusts are undeniably the most economically important fungi in this
clade, as obligate parasites on a wide range of crop plants including
cereal grains, legumes, and trees such as coffee, apple, and pine, where
they can cause extensive reduction in yield and even host death. Other
phytopathogenic Urediniomycetes can be of economic importance, but on a
much smaller scale than rust fungi. Species of *Helicobasidium* cause
root rot diseases of many economically important plants such as
asparagus, beet, mulberry, and pear. *Microbotryum violaceum* causes
anther smut of plants in the Caryophyllaceae, while smut on buckwheat is
caused by *Sphacelotheca fagopyri*. These smuts are not closely related
to the smuts in the Ustilaginomycetes with which they were confused
until molecular sequence data became available.

For a more thorough overview of the class Urediniomycetes, see Swann et
al. (2001); see Fell et al. (2001) for additional details of
urediniomycetous yeasts.
