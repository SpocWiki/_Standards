### Introduction

The Rhodophyta (red algae) are a distinct eukaryotic lineage
characterized by the accessory photosynthetic pigments phycoerythrin,
phycocyanin and allophycocyanins arranged in phycobilisomes, and the
absence of flagella and centrioles (Woelkerling 1990). This is a large
assemblage of between 2500 and 6000 species in about 670 largely marine
genera (Woelkerling 1990) that predominate along the coastal and
continental shelf areas of tropical, temperate and cold-water regions
(Lüning 1990). Red algae are ecologically significant as primary
producers, providers of structural habitat for other marine organisms,
and their important role in the primary establishment and maintenance of
coral reefs. Some red algae are economically important as providers of
food and gels. For this reason, extensive farming and natural harvest of
red algae occurs in numerous areas of the world.

### Characteristics

Red algae have a number of general characteristics that in combination
distinguish them from other eukaryotic groups:

-   absence of flagella and centrioles
-   floridean starch as a storage product and the storage of starch in
    the cytoplasm (Figure 2)
-   phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin as accessory
    pigments
-   unstacked thylakoids in plastids (Figure 3)
-   no chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

Traditionally the red algae were divided into two Classes the
Bangiophyceae and Florideophyceae. Alternatively a single Class, the
Rhodophyceae and two Subclasses, Bangiophycidae and Florideophycidae are
used. Based on ultrastructure and molecular evidence the Bangiophyceae
is now accepted as a paraphyletic group, while the Florideophyceae is
considered to be monophyletic based on two synapomorphic characters -
presence of a filamentous gonimoblast and tetrasporangia (Garbary &
Gabrielson 1990 \[and references within\], Ragan et al. 1994).
