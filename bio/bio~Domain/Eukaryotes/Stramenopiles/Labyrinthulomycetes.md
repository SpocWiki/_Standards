## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Labyrinthulomycetes** (ICNafp) or Labyrinthulea (ICZN) is a class of protists 
> that produce a network of filaments or tubes, 
> which serve as tracks for the cells to glide along and absorb nutrients for them.  
> 
> The two main groups are the labyrinthulids (or slime nets) and thraustochytrids.  
> They are mostly marine, commonly found as parasites on algae and seagrasses 
> or as decomposers on dead plant material.  
> 
> They also include some parasites of marine invertebrates and mixotrophic species 
> that live in a symbiotic relationship with zoochlorella.
