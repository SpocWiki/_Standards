> **Systematics** is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, 
> and the relationships among living things through time. 
> 
> Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: phylogenetic trees, phylogenies).  
> 
> Phylogenies have two components: 
> - branching order (showing group relationships, graphically represented in cladograms) 
> - and branch length (showing amount of evolution).  
> 
> Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits 
> (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) 
> and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). 
> 
> Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.
>
> The word systematics is derived from the Latin word of Ancient Greek origin systema, 
> which means systematic arrangement of organisms. 
> 
> Carl Linnaeus used 'Systema Naturae' as the title of his book.
