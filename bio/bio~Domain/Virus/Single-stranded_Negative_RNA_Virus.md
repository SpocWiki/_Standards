  Scientific Name ::     Tacaribe complex (New world arenaviruses)
  Comments             Electron micrograph. Arenaviridae are RNA viruses whose particles are spherical and have an average diameter of 110-130 nanometers. Arenaviridae members are zoonotic, which means that in nature they are found in reservoir animal hosts.
