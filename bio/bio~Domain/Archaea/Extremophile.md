> An **Extremophile** (from Latin  extremus 'extreme' and Ancient Greek  φιλία (philía) 'love') 
> is an organism that is able to live (or in some cases thrive) in extreme environments, 
> i.e., environments with conditions approaching or stretching the limits of what known life can adapt to, 
> such as extreme temperature, pressure, radiation, salinity, or pH level.
>
> Since the definition of an extreme environment is relative to an arbitrarily defined standard, 
> often an anthropocentric one, 
> these organisms can be considered ecologically dominant in the evolutionary history of the planet. 
> 
> Dating back to more than 40 million years ago, 
> extremophiles have continued to thrive in the most extreme conditions, 
> making them one of the most abundant lifeforms. 
> 
> The study of extremophiles has expanded human knowledge of the limits of life, 
> and informs speculation about extraterrestrial life. 
> 
> Extremophiles are also of interest because of 
> their potential for bioremediation of environments made hazardous to humans 
> due to pollution or contamination.
