## Genesis of[[Eukarya]]] from [[Procaryote]]s 
[[Archaea]] are anaerobic, 
while [[../bio~Tree/Bacteria|Bacteria]] are aerobic. 

It is possible that [[Archaea]]  incorporated  [[Bacteria|Bacteria]] 
which slowly mutated into Mitochondria. (Endosymbiosis)
Internal Surfaces like Mitochondria raised the inner surface which allows for greater Energy Production. 

Protein-Length and Gene-Length increases proportionally, 
until it hits a Plateau at 500 Amino-Acids corresponding to 1500 Genes. 

Until Eucariotes DNA was entirely used for Protein-Encoding. 
The number of Protein Foldings grows exponentially with Protein Length, 
the Search-space was bigger than could be explored with Individuals. 

Non-coding DNA consists of: 
- RNA Synthesis 
- Regulation 
- Introns for flexible Splicing  

The additional Endosymbiosis of a Cyano-Bacterium in an Eucariote 
resulted in the forming of Plant Cells. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A prokaryote (; less commonly spelled **Procaryote**) is a single-celled organism 
> whose cell lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. 
> 
> The word prokaryote comes from the Ancient Greek πρό (pró), meaning 'before', 
> and κάρυον (káruon), meaning 'nut' or 'kernel'. 
> 
> In the earlier two-empire system arising from the work of Édouard Chatton, 
> prokaryotes were classified within the empire Prokaryota. 
> 
> However, in the three-domain system, based upon molecular phylogenetics, 
> prokaryotes are divided into two domains: [[Bacteria|Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]. 
> A third domain, Eukaryota, consists of organisms with nuclei.
>
> Prokaryotes evolved before eukaryotes, and lack nuclei, mitochondria, 
> and most of the other distinct organelles that characterize the eukaryotic cell. 
> 
> Some unicellular prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, form colonies held together by biofilms, 
> and large colonies can create multilayered microbial mats. 
> Prokaryotes are asexual, reproducing via binary fission. 
> Horizontal gene transfer is common as well. 
>
> Molecular phylogenetics has provided insight into the evolution 
> and interrelationships of the three domains of life. 
> 
> The division between prokaryotes and eukaryotes reflects 
> two very different levels of cellular organization; only eukaryotic cells have an enclosed nucleus that contains its DNA, and other membrane-bound organelles including mitochondria. 
> 
> More recently, the primary division has been seen as that between Archaea and Bacteria, 
> since eukaryotes may be part of the archaean clade and have multiple homologies with other Archaea.
>
> Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller and similar than eukaryotic cells. 
> Prokaryotic cells do not enclose their genetic material within a nucleus.
