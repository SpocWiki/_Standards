> **Enterococcus** is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Bacillota. 
> Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, 
> and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone. 
> 
> Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: 
> - E. faecalis (90–95%) and 
> - E. faecium (5–10%). 
> 
> Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, 
> including E. durans, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. raffinosus.
