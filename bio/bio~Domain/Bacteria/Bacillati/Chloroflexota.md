> The **Chloroflexota** are a phylum of bacteria containing isolates with a diversity of phenotypes, 
> including members that are aerobic thermophiles, which use oxygen and grow well in high temperatures; anoxygenic phototrophs, which use light for photosynthesis (green non-sulfur bacteria); and anaerobic halorespirers, which uses halogenated organics (such as the toxic chlorinated ethenes and polychlorinated biphenyls) as electron acceptors.

> The members of the phylum Chloroflexota are monoderms (that is, have one cell membrane with no outer membrane), but they stain mostly gram-negative. Many well-studied phyla of bacteria are diderms and stain gram-negative, whereas well-known monoderms that stain Gram-positive include Firmicutes (or Bacillota) (low G+C gram-positives) and Actinomycetota (high-G+C gram-positives).
