> **Deinococcota** (synonym, Deinococcus-Thermus) is a phylum of bacteria with a single class, Deinococci, 
> that are highly resistant to environmental hazards, also known as extremophiles.
>
> These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains, 
> but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to those of gram-negative bacteria.
