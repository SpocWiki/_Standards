> Escherichia coli ( ESH-ə-RIK-ee-ə KOH-lye) is a gram-negative, 
> facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium 
> of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. 
> Most E. coli strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut, where they constitute about 0.1%, 
> along with other  facultative anaerobes. 
> 
> These bacteria are mostly harmless or even beneficial to humans. 
> For example, some strains of E. coli benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2 
> or by preventing the colonization of the intestine by harmful pathogenic bacteria. 
> These mutually beneficial relationships between E. coli and humans are a type of mutualistic biological relationship—
> where both the humans and the E. coli are benefitting each other. 
> 
> E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. 
> The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for three days, 
> but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.
>
> Some serotypes, such as EPEC and ETEC, are pathogenic, causing serious food poisoning in their hosts.  
> Fecal–oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. 
> This transmission method is occasionally responsible for food contamination incidents that prompt product recalls. 
> Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, 
> which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. 
> A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli 
> which can survive for many days and grow outside a host.
>
> The bacterium can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, 
> and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. 
> 
> E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy. 
> E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, 
> and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, 
> where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. 
> Under favourable conditions, it takes as little as 20 minutes to reproduce.
