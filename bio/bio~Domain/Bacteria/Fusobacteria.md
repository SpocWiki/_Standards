> Fusobacteriota are obligately anaerobic non-sporeforming Gram-negative bacilli. 
> 
> Since the first reports in the late nineteenth century, 
> various names have been applied to these organisms, 
> sometimes with the same name being applied to different species. 
> 
> More recently, not only have there been changes to the nomenclature, 
> but also attempts to differentiate between species 
> which are believed to be either pathogenic or commensal or both. 
> 
> Because of their asaccharolytic nature, 
> and a general paucity of positive results in routine biochemical tests, 
> laboratory identification of the Fusobacteriota has been difficult. 
> 
> However, the application of novel molecular biological techniques to taxonomy has established a number of new species, together with the subspeciation of Fusobacterium necrophorum and F. nucleatum, and provided new methods for identification. The involvement of Fusobacteriota in a wide spectrum of human infections causing tissue necrosis and septicaemia has long been recognised, and, more recently, their importance in intra-amniotic infections, premature labour and tropical ulcers has been reported.

> 
> However, newer methods of investigation have led to a better understanding of the taxonomy, 
> with the description of several new species of Fusobacteriota. 
> 
> Among the new species described are F. ulcerans from tropical ulcers, 
> and several species from the oral cavity. 
> Subspeciation of the important species F. necrophorum and F. nucleatum has also been possible. 
> It is probable that the taxonomy of the Fusobacteriota may be further developed in the future.

> It is the sole phylum in the kingdom **Fusobacteria**ti.
