> A microbial cyst is a resting or dormant stage of a microorganism, 
> that can be thought of as a state of suspended animation 
> in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed 
> and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion. 
> 
> Many groups of single-celled, microscopic organisms, or microbes, 
> possess the ability to enter this dormant state.
>
> Encystment, the process of cyst formation, can function as a method for dispersal 
> and as a way for an organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions. 
> 
> These two functions can be combined when a microbe needs to be able 
> to survive harsh conditions between habitable environments (such as between hosts) 
> in order to disperse. 
> 
> Cysts can also be sites for nuclear reorganization and cell division, 
> and in parasitic species they are often the infectious stage between hosts. 
> When the encysted microbe reaches an environment favorable to its growth 
> and survival, the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as excystation.
>
> Environmental conditions that may trigger encystment include, but are not limited to: 
> - lack of nutrients or oxygen, 
> - extreme temperatures, 
> - desiccation, 
> - adverse pH, and 
> - presence of toxic chemicals which are not conducive for the growth of the microbe.
