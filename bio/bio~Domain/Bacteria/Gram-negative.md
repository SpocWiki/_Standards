> **Gram-negative** bacteria are [[../Bacteria|bacteria]] that, unlike gram-positive bacteria, 
> do not retain the crystal violet stain used in the Gram staining method of bacterial differentiation. 
> 
> Their defining characteristic is that their cell envelope consists of a thin peptidoglycan cell wall 
> sandwiched between an inner (cytoplasmic) membrane and an outer membrane. 
> These bacteria are found in all environments that support life on Earth.
>
> Within this category, notable species include the model organism Escherichia coli, 
> along with various pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
> Chlamydia trachomatis, and Yersinia pestis. 
> 
> They pose significant challenges in the medical field due to their outer membrane, 
> which acts as a protective barrier against numerous antibiotics (including penicillin), 
> detergents that would normally damage the inner cell membrane, 
> and the antimicrobial enzyme lysozyme produced by animals as part of their innate immune system. 
> 
> Furthermore, the outer leaflet of this membrane contains a complex lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
> whose lipid A component can trigger a toxic reaction when the bacteria are lysed by immune cells. 
> This reaction may lead to septic shock, resulting in low blood pressure, 
> respiratory failure, reduced oxygen delivery, and lactic acidosis.
>
> Several classes of antibiotics have been developed to target gram-negative bacteria, 
> including aminopenicillins, ureidopenicillins, cephalosporins, 
> beta-lactam-betalactamase inhibitor combinations (such as piperacillin-tazobactam), 
> folate antagonists, quinolones, and carbapenems. 
> 
> Many of these antibiotics also cover gram-positive bacteria. 
> The antibiotics that specifically target gram-negative organisms 
> include aminoglycosides, monobactams (such as aztreonam), and ciprofloxacin.
