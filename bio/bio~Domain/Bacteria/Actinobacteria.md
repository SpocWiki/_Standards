high G+C Gram positives. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Actinomycetota (or **Actinobacteria**) are a diverse phylum of 
> Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content. 
> They can be terrestrial or aquatic. 
> 
> They are of great importance to land flora because of their contributions to soil systems. 
> In soil they help to decompose the organic matter of dead organisms 
> so the molecules can be taken up anew by plants. 
> 
> While this role is also played by fungi, Actinomycetota are much smaller 
> and likely do not occupy the same ecological niche. 
> 
> In this role the colonies often grow extensive mycelia, as fungi do, 
> and the name of an important order of the phylum, Actinomycetales (the actinomycetes), 
> reflects that they were long believed to be fungi. 
> 
> Some soil actinomycetota (such as Frankia) live symbiotically 
> with the plants whose roots pervade the soil, fixing nitrogen for the plants 
> in exchange for access to some of the plant's saccharides. 
> Other species, such as many members of the genus Mycobacterium, are important pathogens.
>
> Beyond the great interest in Actinomycetota for their soil role, much is yet to be learned about them. 
> Although currently understood primarily as soil bacteria,
>  they might be more abundant in fresh waters. 
>  
>  Actinomycetota is one of the dominant bacterial phyla 
>  and contains one of the largest of bacterial genera, Streptomyces. 
>  Streptomyces and other actinomycetota are major contributors to biological buffering of soils. 
>  They are also the source of many antibiotics.
>
> The Actinomycetota genus Bifidobacterium 
> is the most common bacteria in the microbiome of human infants. 
> Although adults have fewer bifidobacteria, intestinal bifidobacteria help 
> maintain the mucosal barrier and reduce lipopolysaccharide in the intestine.
>
> Although some of the largest and most complex bacterial cells belong to the Actinomycetota, 
> the group of marine Actinomarinales has been described as including 
> the smallest free-living prokaryotic cells.
>
> Some Siberian or Antarctic Actinomycetota are said to be the oldest living organism on Earth, 
> frozen in permafrost at around half a million years ago. 
> The symptoms of life were detected by CO2 release from permafrost samples 640 kya or younger.
