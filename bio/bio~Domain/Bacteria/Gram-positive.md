> **Gram-positive** bacteria are bacteria that give a positive result in the Gram stain test, 
> which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories 
> according to their type of cell wall.
>
> The Gram stain is used by microbiologists to place bacteria into two main categories, 
> gram-positive (+) and gram-negative (−). 
> Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan within the cell wall, 
> and gram-negative bacteria have a thin layer of peptidoglycan.
>
> Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain used in the test, 
> resulting in a purple color when observed through an optical microscope. 
> The thick layer of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall retains the stain 
> after it has been fixed in place by iodine. 
> During the decolorization step, the decolorizer removes crystal violet from all other cells.
>
> Conversely, gram-negative bacteria cannot retain the violet stain after the decolorization step; 
> alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells, 
> making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. 
> Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane 
> and a bacterial outer membrane, 
> causing them to take up the counterstain (safranin or fuchsine) and appear red or pink.
>
> Despite their thicker peptidoglycan layer, 
> gram-positive bacteria are more receptive to certain cell wall–targeting antibiotics 
> than gram-negative bacteria, due to the absence of the outer membrane.
