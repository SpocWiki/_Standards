## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In biological taxonomy, a domain Latin: regio, also dominion, superkingdom, realm, or empire, 
> is the highest taxonomic rank of all organisms taken together. 
> It was introduced in the three-domain system of taxonomy devised 
> by Carl Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark Wheelis in 1990.
>
> According to the domain system, the tree of life consists of 
> - either three domains, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, 
> - or two domains, Archaea and Bacteria, with Eukarya included in Archaea. 
> 
> In the three-domain model, the first two are prokaryotes, 
> single-celled microorganisms without a membrane-bound nucleus. 
> 
> All organisms that have a cell nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles 
> are included in Eukarya and called eukaryotes.
>
> Non-cellular life, most notably the viruses, is not included in this system. 
> 
> Alternatives to the three-domain system include 
> - the earlier two-empire system (with the empires Prokaryota and Eukaryota), and 
> - the eocyte hypothesis (with two domains of Bacteria and Archaea, with Eukarya included as a branch of Archaea).
