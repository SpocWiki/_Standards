Eubacteria, also known as true bacteria or simply bacteria, 
are one of the two major domains of prokaryotic microorganisms, the other being [[Archaea]]. 

Eubacteria represent a vast and diverse group of single-celled organisms 
that are found in virtually every environment on Earth. 

They are characterized by their simple cell structure 
lacking a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles, 
as well as their diverse metabolic capabilities and ecological roles.

## Characteristics

Here are some key features and characteristics of Eubacteria:
### Cell Structure: 
Eubacteria are prokaryotic cells, meaning they lack a membrane-bound nucleus 
and other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. 
Their genetic material, typically in the form of a __circular chromosome__, 
is located in the nucleoid region of the cell.

### Cell Wall Composition: 
Most Eubacteria have a cell wall composed of __peptidoglycan__, 
a unique polymer that provides structural support and protection to the cell. 
The composition and structure of the cell wall 
can vary among different groups of bacteria and can be a key factor in bacterial classification.

### Metabolic Diversity: 
Eubacteria exhibit a wide range of metabolic capabilities, 
including aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, fermentation, and photosynthesis. 
They can obtain energy from various sources, 
including organic compounds, inorganic chemicals, and sunlight.

### Ecological Roles: 
Eubacteria play crucial roles in various ecosystems and are involved in nutrient cycling, 
decomposition, and symbiotic relationships with other organisms. 
They can be found in diverse habitats, including soil, water, air, and living organisms, 
and can colonize extreme environments such as hot springs, deep-sea vents, and acidic lakes.

### Pathogenicity: 
While many Eubacteria are harmless or beneficial to humans and other organisms, 
some species are pathogens that can cause diseases in plants, animals, and humans. 
Examples of pathogenic bacteria include Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, 
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

## Classification: 

There is a great deal of diversity in the domain [Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria "Bacteria"). 
That diversity is further confounded by the [exchange of genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer "Horizontal gene transfer") between different bacterial lineages. 
The occurrence of duplicate genes between otherwise distantly-related bacteria 
makes it nearly impossible to distinguish bacterial species, count the bacterial species on the Earth, 
or organize them into a tree-like structure

Eubacteria are classified into numerous phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species 
based on their genetic, morphological, physiological, and ecological characteristics. 
Some of the major phyla of Eubacteria include Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and others.

Overall, Eubacteria represent a diverse and ecologically important group of microorganisms 
with significant impacts on the environment, human health, and biotechnological applications.
