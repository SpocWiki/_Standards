> **Medusozoa** is a clade in the phylum Cnidaria, and is often considered a subphylum. 
> It includes the classes Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, Staurozoa and Cubozoa, 
> and possibly the parasitic Polypodiozoa. 
> 
> Medusozoans are distinguished by having a medusa stage in their often complex life cycle, 
> a medusa typically being an umbrella-shaped body with stinging tentacles around the edge. 
> 
> With the exception of some Hydrozoa (and Polypodiozoa), 
> all are called jellyfish in their free-swimming medusa phase.
