## Introduction

Representatives of this superfamily occur from the Late Jurassic (135
million years ago) to the Recent, and are widespread in the world oceans
and commonly found as fossils on all continents, including Antarctica.
All known species are azooxanthellate, and occur at depths of 0-3200
meters. Most species are inconspicuous by virtue of small size (as small
as 1 mm calicular diameter) or cryptic and/or deep habitat.
Approximately 110 living species in 18 genera have been described
(Cairns et al., 1999), and about twice that number of fossil species.
All flabelloideans are solitary in growth form; some of them asexually
reproduce by transverse division and various forms of budding. Although
inconspicuous, some occur in large numbers in certain environments.

### Characteristics

The superfamily is characterized by having coralla with a marginothecate
wall, as opposed to a septothecal or parathecal wall of the superfamily
Caryophyllioidea, or the epithecal wall of the Volzeioidea.
Structurally, the marginotheca (Stolarski, 1995) is a primitive,
neotenic wall consisting of vertically arranged minitrabeculae that are
manufactured from the edge zone of the coral. Additional smooth,
non-trabecular calcium carbonate deposits called textura (Stolarski,
1995), literally \"plaster\" in Latin, are often secreted on the outside
of the corallum by the edge zone, and occasionally nontrabecular calcium
carbonate is also deposited within the corallum in a structure called
stereome. The wall of flabelloids is not epithecate, as previously
thought (see Stolarski, 1995), since it consists of trabeculae (epitheca
is nontrabecular) and originates from the edge zone (epitheca originates
from a lappet cavity). Marginotheca is usually quite smooth, often
porcellaneous, but may exhibit low circumferential growth ridges.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

No phylogenetic analysis has been performed on the suprageneric taxa of
the Caryophylliina. Chevalier (1987) did not acknowledge superfamilies
within the suborder Caryophylliina. Most recently, Stolarski (1995,
2000) has examined the wall microstructure of many of the flabelloid
genera, which led to a redefinition of some wall terminology and will
ultimately lead to the redistribution of some of the genera and even
families within this suborder.
