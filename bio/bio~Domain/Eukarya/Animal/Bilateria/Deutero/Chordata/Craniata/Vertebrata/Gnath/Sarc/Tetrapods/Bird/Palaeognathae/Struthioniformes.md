> **Struthioniformes** is an order of birds with only a single extant family, 
> Struthionidae, containing the ostriches. 
> 
> Several other extinct families are known, spanning across the Northern Hemisphere, from the Early Eocene to the early Pliocene, including a variety of flightless forms like the Paleotidae, Geranoididae, Eogruidae and Ergilornithidae, the latter two thought to be closely related to Struthionidae.
