> Rails (avian family **Rallidae**) are a large, cosmopolitan family of 
> small- to medium-sized terrestrial and/or semi-amphibious birds. 
> 
> The family exhibits considerable diversity in its forms, 
> and includes such ubiquitous species as the crakes, coots, and gallinule; 
> other rail species are extremely rare or endangered. 
> 
> Many are associated with wetland habitats, 
> some being semi-aquatic like waterfowl (such as the coot), 
> but many more are wading birds or shorebirds. 
> 
> The ideal rail habitats are marsh areas, including rice paddies, 
> and flooded fields or open forest. 
> 
> They are especially fond of dense vegetation for nesting. 
> The rail family is found in every terrestrial habitat with the exception of dry desert, polar or freezing regions, and alpine areas (above the snow line). Members of Rallidae occur on every continent except Antarctica. Numerous unique island species are known.
