> **hyenas** or hyaenas ( hi-EE-nəz; from Ancient Greek ὕαινα, hýaina) 
> are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae. 
> With just four extant species (each in its own genus), 
> it is the fifth-smallest family in the order Carnivora 
> and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia. 
> Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.
>
> Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids, 
> hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements 
> due to convergent evolution: both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters 
> that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. 
> 
> Both eat food quickly and may store it, 
> and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable claws 
> are adapted for running and making sharp turns. 
> However, hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecation habits, mating, 
> and parental behavior are consistent with the behavior of other feliforms.
>
> Hyenas feature prominently 
> in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them. 
> Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt. 
> In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people's spirits, rob graves, 
> and steal livestock and children. 
> Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional medicine.
