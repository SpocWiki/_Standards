## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Phalacrocoracidae** is a family of approximately 40 species of aquatic birds 
> commonly known as cormorants and shags. 
> 
> Several different classifications of the family have been proposed, 
> but in 2021 the International Ornithologists' Union (IOU) 
> adopted a consensus taxonomy of seven genera. 
> 
> The great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the common shag (Gulosus aristotelis) 
> are the only two species of the family commonly encountered in Britain and Ireland, 
> and the names "cormorant" and "shag" have been 
> later assigned to different species in the family somewhat haphazardly.
>
> Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large birds, 
> with body weight in the range of 0.35–5 kilograms (0.77–11.02 lb) 
> and wing span of 60–100 centimetres (24–39 in). 
> 
> The majority of species have dark feathers. The bill is long, thin and hooked. 
> Their feet have webbing between all four toes. 
> 
> All species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. 
> They are excellent divers, 
> and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings; 
> some cormorant species have been found to dive as deep as 45 metres (150 ft). 
> 
> Cormorants and shags have relatively short wings 
> due to their need for economical movement underwater, 
> and consequently have among the highest flight costs of any flying bird.
>
> Cormorants nest in colonies around the shore, on trees, islets or cliffs. 
> They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters. 
> The original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a freshwater bird. 
> 
> They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands.
>
> Cormorants might have been a freshwater species from south Asia. From there, they spread around the Eurasian landmass and the world.
