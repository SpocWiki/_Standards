## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Brahman is an American breed of zebuine-taurine hybrid beef cattle. 
> It was bred in the United States from 1885 using cattle originating in India, 
> imported at various times from the United Kingdom, India, and Brazil. 
> 
> These were mainly Gir, Guzerá and Nellore stock, with some Indu-Brasil, Krishna Valley and Ongole. 
> The Brahman has a high tolerance of heat, sunlight and humidity, and good resistance to parasites. It has been exported to many countries, particularly in the tropics; in Australia it is the most numerous breed of cattle. It has been used in the creation of numerous taurine-indicine hybrids, some of which – such as the Brangus and Brahmousin – are established as separate breeds.
