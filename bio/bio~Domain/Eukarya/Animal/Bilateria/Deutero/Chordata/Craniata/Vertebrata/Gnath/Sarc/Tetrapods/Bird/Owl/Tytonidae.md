> The bird family **Tytonidae**, which includes the barn owls Tyto and the bay owls Phodilus, 
> is one of the two families of owls, the other being the true owls or typical owls, Strigidae. 
> 
> Tytonidae are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces. 
> They have long, strong legs with powerful talons. 
> Tytonidae also differ from the Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet.
>
> The family is wide-ranging, although they are not very tolerant of severe winter cold, 
> so are absent from northern areas of Europe, Asia, and North America; 
> they are also absent from driest desert regions. 
> 
> They live in a wide range of habitats from semi-deserts to forests, 
> and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. 
> 
> Within these habitats, they live near agricultural areas with high amounts of human activity. 
> The majority of the 20 living species of barn owls are poorly known. 
> Some, like the red owl, have barely been seen or studied since their discovery, 
> in contrast to the western barn owl Tyto alba, which is one of the best-known owl species in the world. 
> However, some subspecies of the western barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species, 
> but are very poorly known.
>
> Five species of barn owl are threatened, 
> and some island species went extinct during the Holocene or earlier 
> (e.g., Tyto pollens, known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas, 
> and possibly the basis for the mythical chickcharney). 
> 
> Barn owls are mostly nocturnal and generally non-migratory, living in pairs or singly.
