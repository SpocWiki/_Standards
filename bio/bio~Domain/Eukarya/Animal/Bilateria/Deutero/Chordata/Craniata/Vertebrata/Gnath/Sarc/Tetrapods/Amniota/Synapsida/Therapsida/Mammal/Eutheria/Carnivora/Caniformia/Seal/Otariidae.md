> An eared seal, otariid, or otary, is any member of the marine mammal family **Otariidae**, 
> one of three groupings of pinnipeds. 
> 
> They comprise 15 extant species in seven genera 
> (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as 
> sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). 
> Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, 
> but breeding and resting on land or ice. 
> 
> They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters 
> throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans, the southern Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. 
> They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.
>
> The words "otariid" and "otary" come from the Ancient Greek ὠτάριον (ōtárion), 
> meaning "little ear", referring to the small but visible external ear flaps (pinnae), 
> which distinguishes them from the phocids.
