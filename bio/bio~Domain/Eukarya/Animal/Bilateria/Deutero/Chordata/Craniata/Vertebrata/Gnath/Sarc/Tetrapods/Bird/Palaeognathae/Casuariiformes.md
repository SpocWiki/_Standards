> The **Casuariiformes**  is an order of large flightless birds that has four surviving members: 
> - the three species of cassowary, and 
> - the only remaining species of emu. 
> 
> They are divided into either a single family, Casuariidae, or occasionally two, 
> with the emu splitting off into its own family, Dromaiidae. 
> 
> The IOC World Bird List and Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Birds of the World both 
> do not recognize Dromaiidae, placing the emu in the family Casuariidae.
>
> All four living members are native to Australia-New Guinea, 
> but some possible extinct taxa occurred in other landmasses.
