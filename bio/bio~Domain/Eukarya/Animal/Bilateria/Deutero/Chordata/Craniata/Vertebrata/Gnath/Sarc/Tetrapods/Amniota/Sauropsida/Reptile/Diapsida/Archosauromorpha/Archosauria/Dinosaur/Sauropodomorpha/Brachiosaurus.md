## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Brachiosaurus** is a genus of sauropod dinosaur 
> that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic, about 155 to 143 million years ago. 
> It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 
> from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. 
> Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; 
> the generic name is Greek for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long arms, 
> and the specific name means "deep chest". 
> 
> Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; 
> body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons. 
> It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, 
> all of which are typical for sauropods. 
> Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, 
> which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.
>
> Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus of the family Brachiosauridae, 
> which includes a handful of other similar sauropods. 
> Most popular depictions of Brachiosaurus are in fact based on Giraffatitan, 
> a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania. 
> Giraffatitan was originally described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914 
> as a species of Brachiosaurus, B. brancai, but moved to its own genus in 2009. 
> 
> Three other species of Brachiosaurus have been named based on fossils found in Africa and Europe; 
> two are no longer considered valid, and a third has become a separate genus, Lusotitan.
>
> The type specimen of B. altithorax is still the most complete specimen, 
> and only a few other specimens are thought to belong to the genus, 
> making it one of the rarer sauropods of the Morrison Formation. 
> It is regarded as a high browser, 
> possibly cropping or nipping vegetation as high as 9 meters (30 ft) off the ground. 
> Unlike other sauropods, it was unsuited for rearing on its hindlimbs. 
> It has been used as an example of a dinosaur that was most likely ectothermic 
> because of its large size and the corresponding need for sufficient forage, 
> but more recent research suggests it was warm-blooded. 
> 
> Among the most iconic and initially thought to be one of the largest dinosaurs, 
> Brachiosaurus has appeared in popular culture, notably in the 1993 film Jurassic Park.
