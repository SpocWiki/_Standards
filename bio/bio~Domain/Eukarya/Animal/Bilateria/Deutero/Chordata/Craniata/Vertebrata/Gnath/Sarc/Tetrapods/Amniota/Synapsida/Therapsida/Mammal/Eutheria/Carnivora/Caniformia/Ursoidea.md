> **Ursoidea** is a superfamily of arctoid carnivoran mammals 
> that includes the families Subparictidae, Amphicynodontidae, and Ursidae. 
> The last family includes the extant lineages of bears, 
> as well as the extinct Hemicyoninae and Ursavinae. 
>
> The interrelationships of ursoids has had slight arrangements. In the past it was thought the extinct Amphicyonidae were stem-bears based on morphological analysis of the ear region, though the most recent publications on early amphicyonids suggests they were basal caniforms. 
>
> The amphicynodontids are sometimes classified as either a subfamily of bears, a paraphyletic assemblage of early bears, or even stem-pinnipeds. The subparictids were previously classified as amphicynodontine/ids. The hemicyonines have been occasionally reclassified as a separate family.
