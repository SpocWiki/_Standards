## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Thoroughbred** is a horse breed developed for horse racing. 
> Although the word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, 
> it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. 
> Thoroughbreds are considered "hot-blooded" horses 
> that are known for their agility, speed, and spirit.
>
> The Thoroughbred, as it is known today, was developed in 17th- and 18th-century England, 
> when native mares were crossbred 
> with imported  stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. 
> 
> All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to 
> three stallions originally imported into England in the 17th and 18th centuries, 
> and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. 
> 
> During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; 
> they were imported into North America starting in 1730 
> and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. 
> 
> Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, 
> and around 100,000 foals are registered each year worldwide.
>
> Thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing, but are also bred for other riding disciplines 
> such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting. 
> 
> They are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones, 
> and have been influential in the creation of the 
> Quarter Horse, Standardbred, Anglo-Arabian, and various warmblood breeds.
>
> Thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion, 
> which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. 
> 
> Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts, 
> and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. 
> 
> There are several theories for the reasons behind 
> the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, 
> and research on the subject is ongoing.
