> **Physeter** is a genus of toothed whales. 
> 
> There is only one living species in this genus: the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). 
> 
> Some extremely poorly known fossil species have 
> also been assigned to the same genus including 
> Physeter antiquus (5.3–2.6 mya) from the Pliocene of France, 
> and Physeter vetus (2.6 mya – 12 ka) from the Quaternary of the U.S. state of Georgia. 
> 
> Physeter vetus is very likely an invalid species, 
> as the few teeth that were used to identify this species 
> appear to be identical to those of another toothed whale, Orycterocetus quadratidens.
>
> Sperm whales spend more than 72% of their time engaged in foraging dive cycles.
>
> Foraging behavior, including buzz vocalizations for prey capture. 
>
> The efficiency of sperm whale foraging is attributed to their effective 
> long range echolocation, and efficient locomotion during deep dives.
>
> The genus name is from Ancient Greek φυσητήρ (phūsētḗr), 
> meaning 'blowpipe', 'blowhole'.
