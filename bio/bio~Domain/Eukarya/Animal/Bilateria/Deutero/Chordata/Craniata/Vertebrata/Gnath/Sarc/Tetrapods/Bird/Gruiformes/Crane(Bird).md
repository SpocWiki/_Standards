> **Crane**s are a type of large bird with long legs and necks in the biological family Gruidae of the order Gruiformes. 
> The family has 15 species placed in four genera which are Antigone, Balearica, Leucogeranus, and Grus. 
> They are large birds with long necks and legs, a tapering form, 
> and long secondary feathers on the wing that project over the tail. 
> 
> Most species have muted gray or white plumages, marked with black, and red bare patches on the face, 
> but the crowned cranes of the genus Balearica have vibrantly-coloured wings and golden "crowns" of feathers. 
> Cranes fly with their necks extended outwards instead of bent into an S-shape and their long legs outstretched.
>
> Cranes live on most continents, with the exception of Antarctica and South America. Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes are solitary during the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the non-breeding season, most species are gregarious, forming large flocks where their numbers are sufficient.
>
> They are opportunistic feeders that change their diets according to the season and their own nutrient requirements. 
> They eat a range of items from small rodents, eggs of birds, fish, amphibians, and insects to grain and berries. 
> 
> Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay a clutch of two eggs at a time. 
> Both parents help to rear the young, which remain with them until the next breeding season. 
> Most species of cranes have been affected by human activities and are at the least classified as threatened, 
> if not critically endangered. 
> 
> The plight of the whooping cranes of North America 
> inspired some of the first US legislation to protect endangered species.
