## Introduction

[Scott J. Steppan and Shawn M. Hamm]()

The genus *Atlantoxerus* contains the single species *Atlantoxerus
getulus,* the Barbary Ground Squirrel. This particular species of
squirrel was first named in Africa by C. Linnaeus in 1758. By 1978, the
squirrel's location was restricted to the Barbary Coast in Northwest
Africa (Corbet 1978). This is the only species of squirrel that is
located north of the Sahara Desert in Africa.

The Barbary Ground Squirrel has been observed to occupy mostly rocky
environments (Nowak 1999), where it creates burrows in the ground or
possible dens within crevices of large rocks. Activity outside the
burrow or den is limited to early morning and late afternoon due to high
temperatures during the height of the day. One characteristic of these
ground squirrels that distinguishes them from many other species of
squirrel is their apparent food preference. The large, olive-like fruit
and seeds of the Argan tree in Morocco is a primary source of food for
these squirrels.

Colonies of multiple groups or families of the squirrels are evident in
areas where there is a secure food source. The squirrels have been
observed to migrate when their population becomes excessive and the food
source becomes scarce (Nowak 1999).

### Characteristics

*A. getulus* is a smaller species of squirrel, with head and body length
160-220 mm, tail length 180-230 mm, and weight range of 300-350 grams
(Krapp *in* Grzimek 1990). It has a white stripe that runs down each
side of its body, with the occasional white stripe straight down the
back.  The fur is short and stiff.

Dental records of *A. getulus* show that it contains two premolars on
both sides of the upper jaw. In many cases, the squirrel has a groove in
the upper incisors (Nowak 1999).

### Classification

[C. Linnaeus (1758) had initially named this squirrel *Sciurus getulus*.
The genus *Atlantoxerus* was established by Forsyth Major (1893). Due to
this squirrel's similar physical characteristics to those squirrels in
genus *Xerus*, *Atlantoxerus* was treated as a subgenus of *Xerus*.
*Atlantoxerus* was formally raised to full generic rank by Thomas
(1909a) and became incorporated into the tribe Xerini by Moore (1959),
within the Subfamily Xerinae (Gromov et al. 1965:70; Wilson and Reeder
2005).]{style="color: black;"}

### Geographic Distribution

*A. getulus* inhabits Morocco and Algeria, countries on the
north-western coast of Africa (Corbet 1978). Within this region, the
squirrel has been found to occupy all areas between the Mediterranean
coasts and the three ranges of the Atlas Mountains, to an elevation of
more than 4,000 meters (Krapp *in* Grzimek 1990). In addition, the
squirrel has been found on the island of Fuerteventura, located in the
Canary Islands off the west coast of Morocco (Nowak 1999).
