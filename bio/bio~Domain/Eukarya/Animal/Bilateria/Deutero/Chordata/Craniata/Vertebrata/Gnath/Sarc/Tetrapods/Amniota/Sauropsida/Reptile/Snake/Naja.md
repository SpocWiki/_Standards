> **Naja** is a genus of venomous elapid snakes commonly known as cobras (or "true cobras"). 
> 
> Various species occur throughout Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
> Several other elapid species are often called "cobras", 
> such as the king cobra and the rinkhals, but they are not "true cobras", 
> in that they do not belong to the genus Naja.
>
> Until recently, the genus Naja had 20 to 22 species, 
> but it has undergone several taxonomic revisions in recent years, 
> so sources vary greatly. 
> 
> Wide support exists, though, for a 2009 revision 
> that synonymised the genera Boulengerina and Paranaja with Naja. 
> According to that revision, the genus Naja now includes 38 species.
