> A passerine () is any bird of the order **Passeriformes** 
> (from Latin passer 'sparrow' and formis '-shaped') 
> which includes more than half of all bird species. 
> 
> Sometimes known as perching birds, passerines 
> generally have an anisodactyl arrangement of their toes 
> (three pointing forward and one back), which facilitates perching.

> With more than 140 families and some 6,500 identified species, Passeriformes is the largest order of birds and one of the most diverse clades of terrestrial vertebrates, representing 60% of birds. Passerines are divided into three suborders: New Zealand wrens; Suboscines, primarily found in North and South America; and songbirds. Passerines originated in the Southern Hemisphere around 60 million years ago.

> Most passerines are insectivorous or omnivorous, and eat both insects and fruit or seeds.
