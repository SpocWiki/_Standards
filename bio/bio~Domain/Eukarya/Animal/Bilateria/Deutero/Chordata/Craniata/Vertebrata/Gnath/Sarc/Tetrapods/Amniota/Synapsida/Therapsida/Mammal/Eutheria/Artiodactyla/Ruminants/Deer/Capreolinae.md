> The **Capreolinae** (synonym Odocoileinae Pocock, 1923) are a subfamily of deer. 
> 
> The scientific name derives from its type genus, Capreolus. 
> Alternatively, they are known as the telemetacarpal deer, 
> due to their bone structure being different from the plesiometacarpal deer subfamily Cervinae. 
> 
> The telemetacarpal deer maintain their distal lateral metacarpals, 
> while the plesiometacarpal deer maintain only their proximal lateral metacarpals.
>
> The Capreolinae are believed to have originated in the Middle Miocene, 
> between 7.7 and 11.5 million years ago, in Central Asia.
>
> The subfamily is sometimes called New World deer in English, 
> though it includes reindeer, elk, water deer and roe deer, 
> all of which live in Eurasia in the Old World.
