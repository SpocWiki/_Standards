> **Bubalus** is a genus of Asiatic bovines 
> that was proposed by Charles Hamilton Smith in 1827. 
> Bubalus and Syncerus form the subtribe Bubalina, the true buffaloes.
>
> The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and classification of domestic animals as species, subspecies, races or breeds has been discussed controversially for many years and was inconsistent between authors. Assessors of the Food and Agriculture Organization consider domestic water buffalo populations as breeds.
>
> Bubalus species comprise the domestic water buffalo (B. bubalis), the wild water buffalo (B. arnee), the tamaraw (B. mindorensis), the lowland anoa (B. depressicornis), and the mountain anoa (B. quarlesi). The latter two anoa species were proposed to form a subgenus Anoa within Bubalus.
