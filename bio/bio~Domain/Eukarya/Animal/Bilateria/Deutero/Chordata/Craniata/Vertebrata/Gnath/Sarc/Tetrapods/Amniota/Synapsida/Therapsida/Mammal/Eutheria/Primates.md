## Lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans 
![Ring-tailed lemurs](Primates/lemurs.jpg)) ![](Primates/saimiri.jpg) ![](Primates/vervet.jpg) 

Primates, the order of mammals that includes humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians, exhibit several specific differences from their parent group within the class Mammalia. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Primates** is an order of mammals, which is further divided into the strepsirrhines, which include lemurs, galagos, and lorisids; and the haplorhines, which include tarsiers and simians (monkeys and apes). Primates arose 74–63 million years ago first from small terrestrial mammals, which adapted for life in tropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to the challenging environment among tree tops, including large brain sizes, binocular vision, color vision, vocalizations, shoulder girdles allowing a large degree of movement in the upper limbs, and opposable thumbs (in most but not all) that enable better grasping and dexterity. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs 30 g (1 oz), to the eastern gorilla, weighing over 200 kg (440 lb). There are 376–524 species of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the 2000s, 36 in the 2010s, and six in the 2020s.
>
> Primates have large brains (relative to body size) compared to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on visual acuity at the expense of the sense of smell, which is the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Some primates, including gorillas, humans and baboons, are primarily ground-dwelling rather than arboreal, but all species have adaptations for climbing trees. Arboreal locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree and swinging between branches of trees (brachiation); terrestrial locomotion techniques include walking on two hindlimbs (bipedalism) and modified walking on four limbs (quadrupedalism) via knuckle-walking.
>
> Primates are among the most social of all animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups. Non-human primates have at least four types of social systems, many defined by the amount of movement by adolescent females between groups. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, reach maturity later, and have longer lifespans. Primates are also the most cognitively advanced animals, with humans (genus Homo) capable of creating complex languages and sophisticated civilizations, while non-human primates have been recorded using tools. They may communicate using facial and hand gestures, smells and vocalizations.
>
> Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create opportunities for the transmission of zoonotic diseases, especially virus diseases including herpes, measles, ebola, rabies and hepatitis. Thousands of non-human primates are used in research around the world because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction. Common threats include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives, and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing for agriculture most threatens primates.

## Characteristics 

Here are some key distinctions:

### Hands and Feet: 
Primates possess specialized hands and feet adapted for grasping and manipulation. They typically have opposable thumbs, allowing for precision grip and dexterity. Primates often have flat nails instead of claws on their digits, facilitating fine motor skills.

### Forward-Facing Eyes: 
Primates have forward-facing eyes with overlapping fields of vision, providing depth perception and stereoscopic vision. This adaptation enhances their ability to judge distances and accurately grasp objects, important for their arboreal lifestyle.

### Dental Formula: 
Primates generally have a characteristic dental formula of 2-1-2-3/2-1-2-3, meaning they have two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws. However, this dental formula can vary among primate species.

### Enhanced Brain Complexity: 
Primates have relatively large brains compared to body size and exhibit increased brain complexity, especially in regions associated with cognition, social behavior, and sensory processing. This enhanced brain development is correlated with their advanced cognitive abilities and social complexity.

### Social Structure: 
Primates often live in social groups characterized by complex social behaviors, such as cooperation, communication, and social hierarchies. While social structures vary among species, many primates exhibit strong social bonds and engage in cooperative activities, such as grooming and group defense.

### Parental Care: 
Primates generally exhibit extensive parental care, with mothers providing substantial investment in raising offspring. Many primate species have long gestation periods, extended periods of infant dependency, and complex social interactions involved in rearing young.

### Arboreal Adaptations: 
While not universal, many primates exhibit adaptations for an arboreal lifestyle, including grasping hands and feet, mobile shoulder joints, and flexible limbs. These adaptations facilitate locomotion in the trees, such as climbing, leaping, and swinging from branches.

### Varied Diet: 
Primates exhibit a wide range of dietary adaptations, including 
- frugivory (fruit-eating), 
- folivory (leaf-eating), 
- insectivory (insect-eating), 
- omnivory (eating a variety of foods), and 
- even carnivory (meat-eating in some species). 
Their dietary flexibility allows them to exploit diverse food resources in their environments.

These specific differences distinguish primates from their parent group within the class Mammalia and reflect their unique evolutionary history, ecological adaptations, and complex behaviors.
