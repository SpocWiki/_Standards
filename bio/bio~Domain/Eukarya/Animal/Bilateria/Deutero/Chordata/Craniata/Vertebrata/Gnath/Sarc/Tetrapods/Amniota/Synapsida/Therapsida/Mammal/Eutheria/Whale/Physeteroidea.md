> **Physeteroidea** is a superfamily that includes three extant species of whales: 
> - the sperm whale, in the genus Physeter, 
> - and the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale, in the genus Kogia. 
> 
> In the past, these genera have sometimes been united in a single family, 
> the Physeteridae, with the two Kogia species in the subfamily Kogiinae; 
> however, recent practice is to allocate the genus Kogia to its own family, 
> the Kogiidae, leaving the Physeteridae as a monotypic (single extant species) family, 
> although additional fossil representatives of both families are known.
