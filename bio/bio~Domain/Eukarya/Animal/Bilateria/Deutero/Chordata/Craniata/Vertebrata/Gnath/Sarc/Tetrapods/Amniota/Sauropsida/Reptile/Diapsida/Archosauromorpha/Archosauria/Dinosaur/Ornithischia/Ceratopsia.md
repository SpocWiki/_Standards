> **Ceratopsia** or Ceratopia (or ; Greek: "horned faces") 
> is a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs 
> that thrived in what are now North America, Asia and Europe, 
> during the Cretaceous Period, 
> although ancestral forms lived earlier, in the Late Jurassic of Asia. 
> 
> The earliest known ceratopsian, Yinlong downsi, 
> lived between 161.2 and 155.7 million years ago. 
> The last ceratopsian species, Triceratops prorsus, became extinct 
> during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, 66 million years ago.
>
> Triceratops is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public. 
> It is traditional for ceratopsian genus names to end in "-ceratops", 
> although this is not always the case. 
> 
> One of the first named genera was Ceratops itself, 
> which lent its name to the group, although it is considered a nomen dubium today 
> as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians.
