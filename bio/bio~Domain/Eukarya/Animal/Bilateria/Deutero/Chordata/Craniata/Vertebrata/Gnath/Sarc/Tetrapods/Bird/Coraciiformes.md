## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Coraciiformes**  are a group of usually colourful birds including 
> the kingfishers, the bee-eaters, the rollers, the motmots, and the todies. 
> 
> They generally have syndactyly, with three forward-pointing toes (and toes 3 & 4 fused at their base), though in many kingfishers one of these is missing.
>
> In the past, Coraciiformes encompassed all anisodactyl (including syndactyl) members of the Cavitaves. This means that the birds currently classified in Leptosomiformes (cuckoo-roller) and Bucerotiformes (hornbills, hoopoes and allies) were formerly classified in Coraciiformes.
>
> This is largely an Old World order, with the representation in the New World limited to the dozen or so species of todies and motmots, and a mere handful of the more than a hundred species of kingfishers.
>
> The name Coraciiformes means "raven-like". Specifically, it comes from the Latin language "corax", meaning "raven" and Latin "forma", meaning "form".
