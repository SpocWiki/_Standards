## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Mammal** (from Latin  mamma 'breast') is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia (). Mammals are characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,640 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 27 orders. The study of mammals is called mammalogy.
>
> The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and eulipotyphlans (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the primates (including humans, monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, camels, and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals).
>
> Mammals are the only living members of Synapsida; this clade, together with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade. Early synapsids are referred to as "pelycosaurs." The more advanced therapsids became dominant during the Guadalupian. Mammals originated from cynodonts, an advanced group of therapsids, during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. Mammals achieved their modern diversity in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been the dominant terrestrial animal group from 66 million years ago to the present.
>
> The basic mammalian body type is quadrupedal, with most mammals using four limbs for terrestrial locomotion; but in some, the limbs are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees or underground. The bipeds have adapted to move using only the two lower limbs, while the rear limbs of cetaceans and the sea cows are mere internal vestiges. Mammals range in size from the 30–40 millimetres (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to the 30 metres (98 ft) blue whale—possibly the largest animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale. All modern mammals give birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes, which lay eggs. The most species-rich group is the viviparous placental mammals, so named for the temporary organ (placenta) used by offspring to draw nutrition from the mother during gestation.
>
> Most mammals are intelligent, with some possessing large brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalise in several ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent marking, alarm signals, singing, echolocation; and, in the case of humans, complex language. Mammals can organise themselves into fission–fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies—but can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.
>
> Domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in the Neolithic Revolution, and resulted in farming replacing hunting and gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the development of the first civilisations. Domesticated mammals provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as food (meat and dairy products), fur, and leather. Mammals are also hunted and raced for sport, kept as pets and working animals of various types, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Paleolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and habitat destruction, primarily deforestation.

Mammalia, the class of vertebrates that includes mammals, 
exhibits several specific differences from their parent group within the superclass [[Tetrapoda]]. 

### Hair and Mammary Glands: 
Mammals are characterized by the presence of hair (fur) covering their bodies, 
which serves various functions including insulation, protection, and sensory perception. 
Additionally, all mammals possess mammary glands 
that produce milk to nourish their offspring, a defining feature of the class.

## Endothermy: 
Most mammals are endothermic, 
meaning they keep up their body temperature internally through metabolic processes. 
This allows mammals to maintain relatively stable body temperatures 
regardless of external environmental conditions, 
enabling them to inhabit diverse habitats worldwide.

### Viviparity: 
Mammals are typically viviparous, giving birth to live young 
that are nourished by maternal placental circulation during gestation. 
This reproductive strategy contrasts with oviparous tetrapods (such as reptiles and birds), 
which lay eggs externally and often rely on environmental heat sources for incubation.

### Specialized Dentition: 
Mammals have a specialized dentition adapted to their diverse dietary habits. 
They possess a combination of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, 
with tooth morphology often reflecting their specific feeding preferences, 
whether herbivorous, carnivorous, or omnivorous.

### Three Middle Ear Bones: 
Mammals possess a unique set of three middle ear bones (the malleus, incus, and stapes) 
that transmit vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. 
These ossicles are derived from bones of the ancestral jaw 
joint found in non-mammalian tetrapods and are essential for hearing.

### Diaphragm: 
Mammals have a muscular diaphragm separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities, 
which aids in breathing by expanding and contracting the lungs. 
The presence of a diaphragm enhances respiratory efficiency 
and allows for more controlled breathing compared to non-mammalian tetrapods.

## Advanced Brain and Behavior: 
Mammals typically have relatively large brains compared to body size 
and exhibit advanced cognitive abilities, sensory perception, and social behaviors. 
These neurological adaptations contribute to the diverse behavioral repertoire seen in mammals, 
from complex social interactions to sophisticated problem-solving skills.

### Mammary Glands: 
Mammals possess specialized mammary glands that produce milk to nourish their young. 
These glands are a defining characteristic of the class 
and play a crucial role in parental care and offspring development.

These specific differences distinguish mammals from their parent group [[Tetrapoda]] 
and reflect their unique evolutionary adaptations for diverse ecological roles and lifestyles.
