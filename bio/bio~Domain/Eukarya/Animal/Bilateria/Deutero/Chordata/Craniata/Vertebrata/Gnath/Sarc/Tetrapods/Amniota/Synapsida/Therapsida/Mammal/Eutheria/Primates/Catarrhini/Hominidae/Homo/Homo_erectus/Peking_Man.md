> Peking Man (Homo erectus pekinensis, originally "Sinanthropus pekinensis") 
> is a subspecies of H. erectus who inhabited what is now northern China during the Middle Pleistocene. 
> 
> Its fossils have been found in a cave some 50 km (31 mi) southwest of Beijing 
> (referred to in the West as Peking upon its first discovery), 
> known as the Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site. 
> 
> The first fossil, a tooth, was discovered in 1921, 
> and Zhoukoudian has since become the most productive H. erectus site in the world. 
> 
> Peking Man was instrumental in the foundation of Chinese anthropology, 
> and fostered an important dialogue between Western and Eastern science. 
> Peking Man became the centre of anthropological discussion, 
> and was classified as a direct human ancestor, 
> propping up the Out of Asia theory that humans evolved in Asia.
>
> Peking Man also played a vital role in the restructuring of Chinese identity 
> following the Chinese Communist Revolution, 
> and it was used to introduce the general populace to Marxism and science. 
> 
> Early models of Peking Man society were compared to communist or nationalist ideals, 
> leading to discussions on primitive communism and polygenism 
> (that Peking Man was the direct ancestor of Chinese people). 
> 
> This produced a strong schism between Western and Eastern interpretations 
> of the origin of modern humans, 
> especially as the West adopted the Out of Africa theory in the late 20th century, 
> which described Peking Man as an offshoot in human evolution. 
> Though Out of Africa is now the consensus, 
> Peking Man interbreeding with human ancestors is still discussed.
>
> Peking Man characterises the classic H. erectus anatomy. 
> The skull is long and heavily fortified, 
> featuring an inflated bar of bone circumscribing the crown, crossing along the brow ridge, 
> over the ears, and connecting at the back of the skull; 
> as well as a sagittal keel running across the midline. 
> The bone of the skull and the long bones is extremely thickened. 
> 
> The face is protrusive (midfacial prognathism), the eye sockets are wide, 
> the jaws are robust and chinless, the teeth are large, and the incisors are shovel-shaped. 
> Brain volume ranged from 850 to 1,225 cc (52 to 75 cu in), for an average of just over 1,000 cc 
> within the range of variation for modern humans. 
> 
> The limbs are broadly anatomically comparable to those of modern humans. 
> H. erectus in such northerly latitudes may have averaged roughly 150 cm (4 ft 11 in) in height, 
> compared to 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) for more tropical populations.
>
> Peking Man lived in a cool, predominantly steppe, partially forested environment, 
> alongside deer, rhinos, elephants, bison, buffalo, bears, wolves, big cats, and other animals. 
> 
> Peking Man intermittently inhabited the Zhoukoudian cave site 
> from as far back as 800,000 years ago to as recently as 230,000 years ago, 
> but the precise chronology is unclear. 
> 
> This spans several cold glacial and warm interglacial periods. 
> The cultural complexity of Peking Man is fiercely debated. 
> 
> If Peking Man was capable of hunting (as opposed to predominantly scavenging), 
> making clothes, and controlling fire, the population would have been well-equipped 
> to survive frigid glacial periods. 
> If not, the population would have had to retreat southward and return later. 
> 
> It is further disputed if Peking Man inhabited the cave, 
> or was killed by giant hyenas (Pachycrocuta) and dumped there. 
> 
> Over 100,000 pieces of stone tools have been recovered from Zhoukoudian. 
> Those pieces have been mainly debitage (wastage), 
> but also include many simple choppers and flakes, 
> and a few retouched tools such as scrapers and possibly burins.
