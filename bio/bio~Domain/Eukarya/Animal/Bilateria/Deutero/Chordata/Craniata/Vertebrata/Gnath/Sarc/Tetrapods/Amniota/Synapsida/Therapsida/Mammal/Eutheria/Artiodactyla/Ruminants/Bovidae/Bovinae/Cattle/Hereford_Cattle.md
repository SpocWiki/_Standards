> The Hereford is a British  breed of beef cattle originally from Herefordshire 
> in the West Midlands of England. 
> 
> It was the result of selective breeding from the mid-eighteenth century 
> by a few families in Herefordshire, 
> beginning some decades before the noted work of Robert Bakewell.
>
> It has spread to many countries; in 2023 the populations reported by 62 countries 
> totalled over seven million head; 
> populations of over 100000 were reported by Uruguay, Brazil and Chile. 
> 
> The breed reached Ireland in 1775, and a few went to Kentucky in the United States in 1817; 
> the modern American Hereford derives from a herd established in 1840 in Albany, New York. 
> 
> It was present in Australia before 1850, and in Argentina from 1858. 
> In the twenty-first century there are breed societies in those countries 
> and in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden in Europe; in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay in South America; in New Zealand; and in South Africa.
