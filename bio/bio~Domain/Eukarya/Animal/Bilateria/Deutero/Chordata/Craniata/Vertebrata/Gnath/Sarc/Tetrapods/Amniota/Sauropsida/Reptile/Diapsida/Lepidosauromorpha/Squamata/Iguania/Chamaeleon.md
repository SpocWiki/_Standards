> Chameleons or chamaeleons (family **Chamaeleonidae**) 
> are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards 
> with 200 species described as of June 2015. 
> 
> The members of this family are best known for their distinct range of colours, 
> being capable of colour-shifting camouflage. 
> 
> The large number of species in the family 
> exhibit considerable variability in their capacity to change colour. 
> For some, it is more of a shift of brightness (shades of brown); 
> for others, a plethora of colour-combinations (reds, yellows, greens, blues) can be seen.
>
> Chameleons are also distinguished by their 
> - zygodactylous feet, 
> - prehensile tail, 
> - laterally compressed bodies, 
> - head casques, 
> - projectile tongues used for catching prey, 
> - swaying gait, and 
> - crests or horns on their brow and snout in some species . 
> 
> Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, and because of this 
> the chameleon’s brain is constantly analyzing two separate images of its environment. 
> When hunting prey, the eyes focus forward in coordination, affording stereoscopic vision.
>
> Chameleons are diurnal and adapted for visual hunting of invertebrates, mostly insects, 
> although the large species also can catch small vertebrates. 
> 
> Chameleons typically are arboreal, but there are also many species that live on the ground. 
> The arboreal species use their prehensile tail as an extra anchor point 
> when they are moving or resting in trees or bushes; 
> because of this, their tail is often referred to as a "fifth limb". 
> 
> Depending on species, they range from rainforest to desert conditions 
> and from lowlands to highlands, with the vast majority occurring in Africa (about half of the species are restricted to Madagascar), but with a single species in southern Europe, and a few across southern Asia as far east as India and Sri Lanka. They have been introduced to Hawaii and Florida.
