> The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a slow-moving, filter-feeding carpet shark 
> and the largest known extant fish species. 
> 
> The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8 m (61.7 ft). 
> The whale shark holds many records for size in the animal kingdom, 
> most notably being by far the most massive living non-cetacean animal. 
> 
> It is the only living species of the genus Rhincodon 
> and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae, 
> which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. 
> 
> Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae. 
> An extinct species, Rhincodon ferriolensis was described in Europe (probably in Spain), 
> in Late Burdigalian stage. 
>
> The whale shark is an active filter feeder, primarily consuming plankton, krill, fish eggs, 
> and small schooling fish such as sardines and anchovies. 
> 
> It employs two main feeding methods: 
> - ram filtration, where it swims forward with its mouth open to force water over its gill rakers, 
> - and active suction feeding, where it gulps water while stationary. 
> 
> The shark can process over 6,000 liters of water per hour 
> through its specialized sieve-like gill pads. 
> 
> Highly migratory, the whale shark travels thousands of miles across tropical oceans 
> to exploit seasonal food sources, with large, predictable feeding aggregations 
> occurring at coastal sites such as Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia, the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, and off the coast of Gujarat and Kerala in India. 
> 
> Despite its immense size, the whale shark is docile 
> and poses no significant threat to humans. 
> 
> It is currently listed as an Endangered species on the IUCN Red List 
> owing to a population decline of more than 50% over the last 75 years, 
> primarily as a result of targeted fishing, bycatch in other fisheries, and collisions with large ships.
>
> Whale sharks inhabit the open waters of all tropical oceans. 
> They are rarely found in water below 21 °C (70 °F). 
> 
> The lifespan of a whale shark is estimated to be between 80 and 130 years, 
> based on studies of their vertebral growth bands and the growth rates of free-swimming sharks. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders, which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks, the megamouth shark and the basking shark. They feed almost exclusively on plankton and small fishes and do not generally pose a threat to humans.
>
> The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6 m (15 ft) specimen in Table Bay, South Africa. Andrew Smith, a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town, described it the following year. The name "whale shark" refers to the animal's appearance and large size; it is a fish, not a mammal, and, like all sharks, is not closely related to whales.
