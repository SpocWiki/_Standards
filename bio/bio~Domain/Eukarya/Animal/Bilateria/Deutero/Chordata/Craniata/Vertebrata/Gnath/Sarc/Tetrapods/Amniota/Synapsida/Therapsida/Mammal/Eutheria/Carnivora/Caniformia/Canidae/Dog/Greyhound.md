> The English **Greyhound**, or simply the Greyhound, is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing, greyhound racing and hunting. Some are kept as show dogs or pets.
>
> Greyhounds are defined as a tall, muscular, smooth-coated, "S-shaped" type of sighthound with a long tail and tough feet. Greyhounds are a separate breed from other related sighthounds, such as the Italian greyhound.
>
> The Greyhound's combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine, and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 km/h (40 mph). A racing greyhound can reach a full speed of at least 69 km/h (43 mph).
>
> However, the most common speeds at which they usually win races are 58–61 km/h (36–38 mph). Its maximum speed is attained whether running on a straight track or a curved track.
