> **Arctoidea** is an infraorder of mostly carnivorous mammals which include 
> - the extinct Hemicyonidae (dog-bears), and 
> - the extant Musteloidea (weasels, raccoons, skunks, red pandas), 
> - Pinnipedia (seals, sea lions), and 
> - Ursidae (bears), 
> found in all continents from the Eocene, 46 million years ago, to the present. 
> The oldest group of the clade is the bears, as their CMAH gene is still intact. 
> The gene became non-functional in the common ancestor of the Mustelida 
> (the musteloids and pinnipeds). 
> 
> Arctoids are caniforms, along with dogs (canids) and extinct bear dogs (Amphicyonidae).
>
> The earliest caniforms were superficially similar to martens, 
> which are tree-dwelling mustelids.
>
> Together with feliforms, caniforms compose the order Carnivora; 
> sometimes Arctoidea can be considered a separate suborder from Caniformia and a sister taxon to Feliformia.
