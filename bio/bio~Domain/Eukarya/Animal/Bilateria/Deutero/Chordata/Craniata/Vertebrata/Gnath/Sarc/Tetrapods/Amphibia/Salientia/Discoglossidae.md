Discoglossid frogs

Some researchers, though, suggest that Alytes and Discoglossus are different enough to be treated as belonging to separate families, implying resurrection of the Discoglossidae. The term "discoglossid" has also been used to refer to many primitive fossil frogs that share plesiomorphic (ancestral) similities to alytids, but that are probably not closely related.

## Introduction

[David Cannatella]()

This family includes two living genera, Discoglossus and Alytes. Both
are small frogs (Snout vent-length about 40-70 mm). The family is
distributed in Europe and northwest Africa (Arnold et al., 1978).

Discoglossus (Painted Frogs) resemble true frogs of the genus Rana; they
are somewhat smooth and shiny. The shape of the pupil is like an
inverted teardrop. Painted frogs are usually found in and around water.

Midwife toads (Alytes) are stockier, more toadlike, and more
terrestrial, being found in woodlands and rocky areas. The male of
Alytes obstetricans carries the strings of eggs, adherent to his back
and thighs, until they hatch into water. The tadpoles are ordinary
pond-type tadpoles with median spiracle, beaks, and two upper and three
lower rows of denticles.

Alytes muletensis was first described as a new genus, Baleaphryne, from
Pleistocene fossil material. It was only later discovered that the
species was still extant on the island of Mallorca, which is part of
Spain (Hemmer and Alcover, 1984). The genus Baleaphryne was later
synonymized into Alytes.

With the removal of Bombina and Barbourula from Discoglossidae, the
fossil range of the family is unclear. See below under \"Phylogenetic
Relationships.\"

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

Discoglossidae is the node-based name for the ancestor of Alytes +
Discoglossus, and its descendants. By this definition, some fossils
currently referred to \"Discoglossidae\", such as †Eodiscoglossus and
†Latonia, likely will be excluded when their phylogenetic relationships
are understood. The synapomorphies of Discoglossidae include a V-shaped
parahyoid bone (convergent with Pelodytes) and a narrow epipubic
cartilage plate (Cannatella, 1985).

Almost all workers have placed Alytes, Discoglossus, Bombina, and
Barbourula in the same taxon, although the dissimilarity of Alytes and
Discoglossus, on one hand, and Bombina on the other has often been noted
(e.g., Lanza et al., 1976). Synapomorphies of Discoglossanura (Ford and
Cannatella, 1993) reject the monophyly of \"Discoglossidae\" as
traditionally used. However, Hay et al. (1995) found Bombina orientalis
and Discoglossus pictus to be closest relatives; this supports the
traditional arrangement of the Discoglossidae.
