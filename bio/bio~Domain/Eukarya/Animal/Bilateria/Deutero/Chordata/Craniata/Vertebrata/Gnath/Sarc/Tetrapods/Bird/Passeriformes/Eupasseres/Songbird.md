> A **Songbird** is a bird belonging to the suborder Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). 
> Another name that is sometimes seen as the scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin oscen, "songbird". 
> The Passeriformes contains 5,000 or so species found all over the world, 
> in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as 
> to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song.
>
> Songbirds form one of the two major lineages of extant perching birds (~4,000 species), 
> the other being the Tyranni (~1,000 species), 
> which are most diverse in the Neotropics and absent from many parts of the world. 
> 
> The Tyranni have a simpler syrinx musculature, 
> and while their vocalizations are often just as complex and striking as those of songbirds, they are altogether more mechanical sounding. 
> There is a third perching bird lineage, the Acanthisitti of New Zealand, 
> of which only two species remain alive today. 
> 
> Recent estimates indicate that songbirds originated 50 million years ago. 
> The distribution of their basal lineages suggests that their origin 
> and initial diversification occurred exclusively in the Australian continent; 
> and only about 40 million years ago, oscines started to colonize Eurasia, Africa, 
> and eventually the Americas.
