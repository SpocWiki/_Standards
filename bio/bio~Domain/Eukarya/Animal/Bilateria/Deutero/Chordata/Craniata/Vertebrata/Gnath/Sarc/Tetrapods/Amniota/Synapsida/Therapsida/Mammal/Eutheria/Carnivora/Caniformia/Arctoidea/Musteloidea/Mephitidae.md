> **Mephitidae** is a family of mammals comprising the skunks and stink badgers. 
> 
> They are noted for the great development of their anal scent glands, 
> which they use to deter predators. 
> 
> Skunks were formerly classified as a subfamily of the Mustelidae (the weasel family); 
> however, in the 1990s, genetic evidence caused skunks to be treated as a separate family. 
> 
> Similarly, the stink badgers had been classified with badgers, 
> but genetic evidence shows they share a more recent common ancestor with skunks, 
> so they are now included in the skunk family. A 2017 study using retroposon markers indicated that they are most closely related to the Ailuridae (red pandas and allies) and Procyonidae (raccoons and allies).
>
> There are sixteen extant species of mephitids in four genera: Conepatus (hog-nosed skunks, four species); Mephitis (the hooded and striped skunks, two species); Mydaus (stink badgers, two species); and Spilogale (spotted skunks, eight species). The two stink badgers in the genus Mydaus inhabit Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines; the other members of the family inhabit the Americas, ranging from Canada to central South America. All other mephitids are extinct, known through fossils, including those from Eurasia.
