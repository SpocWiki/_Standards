# [[Feather]]

Feathers trap more air relative to their mass than fur, resulting in lower effective heat transfer.

#### Loft

Feathers consist of a central rachis with barbs and barbules that interlock, 
forming a three-dimensional lattice. 
This structure traps air with minimal material mass, yielding high insulation efficiency. 
Down feathers can reach loft values exceeding 600 cm³/g 
compared to only 250 cm³/g for fur.

But Fur retains relatively more air under Compression and Humidity (when oiled) than feathers.

> **Feather**s are epidermal growths

> 
> They are the **most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates**

> Although feathers cover most of the bird's body,

> They **aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing**. 
> In addition, coloration helps in communication and protection. 
> The study of feathers is called plumology (or plumage science).

> People use feathers in many ways that are practical, cultural, and religious. 
> Feathers are both soft and excellent at trapping heat; thus, they are
