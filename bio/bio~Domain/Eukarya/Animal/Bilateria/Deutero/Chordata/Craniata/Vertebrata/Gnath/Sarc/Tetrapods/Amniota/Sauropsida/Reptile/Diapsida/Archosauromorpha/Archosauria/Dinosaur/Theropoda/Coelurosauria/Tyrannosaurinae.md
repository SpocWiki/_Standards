> **Tyrannosaurinae** (or tyrannosaurines) is one of the two extinct subfamilies of Tyrannosauridae, 
> a family of coelurosaurian theropods that consists of at least three tribes and several genera. 
> 
> All fossils of these genera have been found in the Late Cretaceous deposits of western North America and east Asia. Compared to the related subfamily Albertosaurinae, tyrannosaurines overall are more robust and larger though the alioramins were gracile by comparison. This subfamily also includes  Lythronax, one of the oldest known tyrannosaurid genera, as well as the youngest and most famous member of the group, Tyrannosaurus rex.
