> **Aeluroidea**, Ailuroidea, or Feloidea is the name of a taxon (infraorder or superfamily) 
> comprising cat-like Carnivora. 
> 
> More specifically the taxon comprises:
> - either cat-like Carnivora in the broader sense, i.e. it is synonymous with Feliformia (more specifically either Feliformia sensu stricto, i.e. crown Feliformia, or Feliformia sensu lato, i.e. Pan-Feliformia);
> - or cat-like Carnivora in the narrower sense, i.e. it comprises only the family **Felidae** (recently also Prionodontidae) and its closest extinct relatives.
>
> The Aeluroidea in the first, i.e. broader sense, 
> has been sometimes called infraorder Aeluroida since 1982. 
> The name Feloidea is sometimes used in a third sense—
> it designates the taxon corresponding to all Feliformia except the family Nandiniidae.
>
> In the main system used here, the name Aeluroidea refers to the crown Feliformia 
> (Feliformia sensu stricto) and has the rank of an infraorder, 
> and Feloidea refers to the Felidae, Prionodontidae 
> and their extinct closest relatives and has the rank of a superfamily.
