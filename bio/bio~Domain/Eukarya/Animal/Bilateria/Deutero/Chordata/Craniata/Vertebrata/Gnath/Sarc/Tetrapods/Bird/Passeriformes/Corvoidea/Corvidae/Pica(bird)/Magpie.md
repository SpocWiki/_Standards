## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Eurasian magpie or common magpie (Pica pica) is a resident breeding bird throughout the northern part of the Eurasian continent. 
> 
> It is one of several birds in the crow family (corvids) designated magpies, 
> and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of "monochrome" magpies. 
> 
> In Europe, "magpie" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the Eurasian magpie: 
> the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki), 
> which is limited to the Iberian Peninsula. 
> 
> Despite having a shared name and similar colouration, 
> it is not closely related to the Australian magpie.
>
> The Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds. 
> The expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size 
> as the brain of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans. 
> 
> It is the only non-mammalian species known to pass the mirror test.
