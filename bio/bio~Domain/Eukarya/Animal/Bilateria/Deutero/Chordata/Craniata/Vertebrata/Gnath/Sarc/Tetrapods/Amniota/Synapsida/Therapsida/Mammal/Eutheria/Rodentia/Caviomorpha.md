> **Caviomorpha** is the rodent parvorder that unites all New World hystricognaths. 
> It is supported by both fossil and molecular evidence. 
> 
> The Caviomorpha was for a time considered to be a separate order outside the Rodentia, 
> but is now accepted as a genuine part of the rodents. 
> 
> Caviomorphs include the extinct Heptaxodontidae (giant hutias), 
> the extinct Josephoartigasia monesi (the largest rodent ever known) 
> and extant families of chinchilla rats, hutias, guinea pigs and the capybara, chinchillas and viscachas, tuco-tucos, agoutis, pacas, pacaranas, spiny rats, New World porcupines, coypu and octodonts (Vassallo and Antenucci, 2015).
