> The Dalmatian is a breed of dog with a white coat marked with dark-coloured spots. 
> Originally bred as a hunting dog, it was also used as a carriage dog 
> and also known as fire dogs in its early days 
> while firefighters were still using horse-drawn carriages. 
> 
> The origins of this breed can be traced back to Croatia 
> and its historical region of Dalmatia. 
> 
> It is thought that early ancestors of the breed were certain breeds of pointers 
> and a spotted Great Dane. 
> 
> Today, it is a popular pet 
> and many enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.
