> **Feliformia** is a suborder within the order Carnivora consisting of "cat-like" carnivorans, 
> including cats, hyenas, mongooses, viverrids, and related taxa
> . Feliformia stands in contrast to the other suborder of Carnivora, 
> Caniformia consisting of "dog-like" carnivorans (includes Canoidea).
>
> The separation of the Carnivora into the broad groups of feliforms and caniforms is widely accepted, as is the definition of Feliformia and Caniformia as suborders (sometimes superfamilies). 
> The classification of feliforms as part of the Feliformia suborder 
> or under separate groupings continues to evolve.
>
> Systematic classifications dealing with only extant taxa include all feliforms into the Feliformia suborder, though variations exist in the definition and grouping of families and genera. Indeed, molecular phylogenies suggest that all extant Feliformia are monophyletic.
>
> Systematic classifications dealing with both extant and extinct taxa vary more widely. Some separate the feliforms (extant and extinct) as Aeluroidea (superfamily) and Feliformia (suborder). Others include all feliforms (extant, extinct and "possible ancestors") into the Feliformia suborder. Some studies suggest this inclusion of "possible ancestors" into Feliformia (or even Carnivora) may be spurious. The extinct (â€ ) families as reflected in the taxa chart are the least problematic in terms of their relationship with extant feliforms (with the most problematic being Nimravidae).
