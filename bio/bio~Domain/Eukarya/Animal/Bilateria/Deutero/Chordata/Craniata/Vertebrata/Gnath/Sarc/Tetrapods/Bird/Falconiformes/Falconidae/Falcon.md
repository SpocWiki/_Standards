> **Falcon**s are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. 
> Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies, 
> and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels. 
> 
> Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, 
> though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.
>
> Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, 
> which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. 
> Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, 
> which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. 
> This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults.
>
> The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, 
> which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of "falcons". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial "tooth" on the side of their beaksâ€”unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet.

> The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm (26 in) in length.  The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just 20 cm (7.9 in).  As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.

> As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes. They are fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).
