> The Manx cat (in earlier times often spelled Manks) is a breed of domestic cat (Felis catus) 
> originating on the Isle of Man, with a mutation that shortens the tail. 
> 
> Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, 
> but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; 
> this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, 
> along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. 
> 
> Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited. Long-haired variants are sometimes considered a separate breed, the Cymric cat.
>
> Manx are prized as skilled hunters, and thus have often been sought by farmers with rodent problems, and been a preferred ship's cat breed. They are said to be social, tame and active. Two local terms for the cats on their home island are stubbin (those with a short tail) and rumpy (those with no tail). Manx have been exhibited in cat shows since the 1800s, with the first known breed standard published in 1903.
