> A **Pony** is a type of small horse, usually under a specific height at full maturity. 
> Ponies often have thicker coats, manes and tails, compared to larger horses, 
> and proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, thicker necks 
> and shorter heads. 
> 
> In modern use, breed registries and horse shows may define a pony 
> as measuring at the withers below a certain height; 
> height limits varying from about 142 cm (14.0 h) to 150 cm (14.3 h). 
> 
> Some distinguish between horse or pony based on its breed or phenotype, regardless of its height. 
> 
> The word pony derives from the old French poulenet, 
> a diminutive of poulain meaning foal, a young, immature horse. 
> 
> A full-sized horse may sometimes be called a pony as a term of endearment.
