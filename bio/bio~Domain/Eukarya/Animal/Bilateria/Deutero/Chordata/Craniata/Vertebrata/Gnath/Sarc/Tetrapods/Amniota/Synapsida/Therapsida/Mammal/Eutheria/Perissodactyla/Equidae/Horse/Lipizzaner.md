> The Lipizzan or **Lipizzaner** (Croatian: Lipicanac, Czech: Lipicán, German: Lipizzaner, 
> Hungarian: Lipicai, Italian: Lipizzano, Serbian: Lipicaner, Slovene: Lipicanec) 
> is a European breed of riding horse developed in the Habsburg Empire in the sixteenth century. 
> It is of Baroque type, and is powerful, slow to mature and long-lived; the coat is usually gray. 
>
> The name of the breed derives from that of the village of Lipica (Italian: Lipizza), 
> which was part of the Habsburg empire at the time the breed was developed, now in Slovenia, 
> one of the earliest stud farms established; the stud farm there is still active. 
> 
> The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, 
> including during the War of the First Coalition, World War I, and World War II. 
> The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by US troops was made famous 
> by the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. 
>
> The Lipizzaner is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, 
> where the horses demonstrate the haute école or "high school" movements of classical dressage, 
> including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the "airs above the ground". 
> These horses are mostly bred at the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, 
> and are trained using traditional methods of classical dressage that date back hundreds of years.
>
> Eight stallions are recognized as the classic foundation bloodstock of the breed, 
> all foaled in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
> All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to these eight stallions, 
> and all breeding stallions have included in their name the name of the foundation sire of their bloodline. 
> Also classic mare lines are known, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. 
> The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, 
> which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. 
> Most Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, South Africa, and Australia.
>
> Lipizzan horse breeding traditions are recognized by UNESCO 
> and inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
