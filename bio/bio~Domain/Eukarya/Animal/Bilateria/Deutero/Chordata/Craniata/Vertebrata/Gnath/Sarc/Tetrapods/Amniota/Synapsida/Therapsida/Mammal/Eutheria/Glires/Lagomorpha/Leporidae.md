## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Leporidae** is the family of rabbits and hares (Lepus), 
> containing over 70 species of extant mammals in all. 
> 
> Together with the pikas, the Leporidae constitute the mammalian order Lagomorpha. 
> Leporidae differ from pikas in that they have short, furry tails and elongated ears and hind legs.
>
> The common name rabbit usually applies to all genera in the family except Lepus, 
> while members of the genus Lepus (comprising nearly half the species) are usually called hares. 
> 
> Like most common names, however, the distinction does not match current taxonomy completely; jackrabbits are members of Lepus, and members of the genera Pronolagus and Caprolagus are called red rock hares and hispid hares respectively.
>
> Various countries across all continents except Antarctica and Australia have indigenous species of Leporidae. Furthermore, the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, and the European hare, Lepus europaeus, have been introduced to Australia and to many other islands, where they pose serious ecological and commercial threats due to their adaptability and lack of natural predators.
