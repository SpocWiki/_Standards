> The **Gruiformes** are an order containing a considerable number of living and extinct bird families, 
> with a widespread geographical diversity. Gruiform means "crane-like".
>
> Traditionally, a number of wading and terrestrial bird families 
> that did not seem to belong to any other order were classified together as Gruiformes. 
> These include 15 species of large cranes, about 145 species of smaller crakes and rails, 
> as well as a variety of families comprising one to three species, 
> such as the Heliornithidae, the limpkin, or the Psophiidae.
>
> Other birds have been placed in this order more out of necessity to place them somewhere; 
> this has caused the expanded Gruiformes to lack distinctive apomorphies. 
> Recent studies indicate that these "odd Gruiformes" are 
> if at all only loosely related to the cranes, rails, and relatives ("core Gruiformes").
