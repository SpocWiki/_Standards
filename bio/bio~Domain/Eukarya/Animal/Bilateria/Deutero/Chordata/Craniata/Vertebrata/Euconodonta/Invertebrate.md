> **Invertebrate**s are animals that neither develop nor retain a vertebral column 
> (commonly known as a spine or backbone), which evolved from the notochord. 
> 
> It is a paraphyletic grouping including 
> **all animals excluding the chordate subphylum [[../../Vertebrata|Vertebrata]]**, i.e. vertebrates. 
> Well-known phyla of invertebrates include arthropods, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, flatworms, cnidarians, and sponges.
>
> The majority of animal species are invertebrates; 
> one estimate puts the figure at 97%.  
> Many invertebrate taxa have a greater number and diversity of species 
> than the entire subphylum of Vertebrata. 
> Invertebrates vary widely in size, from 10 μm (0.0004 in) myxozoans to the 9–10 m (30–33 ft) colossal squid.
>
> Some so-called invertebrates, such as the Tunicata and Cephalochordata, 
> are actually sister chordate subphyla to Vertebrata, being more closely related to vertebrates than to other invertebrates. This makes the "invertebrates" paraphyletic, so the term has no significance in taxonomy.
