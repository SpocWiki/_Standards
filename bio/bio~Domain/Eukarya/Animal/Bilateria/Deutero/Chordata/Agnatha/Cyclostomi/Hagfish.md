## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hagfish**, of the class Myxini  (also known as Hyperotreti) and order Myxiniformes , 
> are eel-shaped jawless fish (occasionally called slime eels). 
> 
> Hagfish are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column, 
> although they do have rudimentary vertebrae. 
> 
> Hagfish are marine predators and scavengers 
> that can defend themselves against other larger predators 
> by releasing copious amounts of slime from mucous glands in their skin.
>
> Although their exact relationship to the only other living group of jawless fish, the lampreys, 
> was long the subject of controversy, 
> genetic evidence suggests that hagfish and lampreys are more closely related to each other 
> than to jawed vertebrates, thus forming the superclass Cyclostomi. 
> 
> The oldest-known stem group hagfish are known from the Late Carboniferous, 
> around 310 million years ago, 
> with modern representatives first being recorded in the mid-Cretaceous around 100 million years ago.
