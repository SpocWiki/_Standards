## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The beetle family Chrysomelidae, commonly known as **Leaf beetle**s, 
> includes over 37,000 (and probably at least 50,000) species in more than 2,500 genera, 
> making it one of the largest and most commonly encountered of all beetle families. 
> 
> Numerous subfamilies are recognized, but the specifics of leaf beetle taxonomy 
> and systematics are likely to change with ongoing research.
>
> Adult and larval leaf beetles feed on a variety of plant tissue, 
> with some being specialists of particular species or families of plant. 
> 
> Many are serious pests of cultivated plants, for example 
> - the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), 
> - the asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi), 
> - the cereal leaf beetle (Oulema melanopus), 
> - the mustard beetle (Phaedon cochleariae) 
> - and various flea beetles
> A few act as vectors of plant diseases. 
> Others are beneficial due to their use in biocontrol of invasive weeds. 
> Some Chrysomelidae are conspicuously colored, 
> typically in glossy yellow to red or metallic blue-green hues, 
> and some (especially Cassidinae) have spectacularly bizarre shapes. 
> Thus, they are highly popular among insect collectors.
