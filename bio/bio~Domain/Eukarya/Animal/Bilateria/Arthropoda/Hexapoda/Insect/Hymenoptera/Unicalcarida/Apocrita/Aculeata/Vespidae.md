> The **Vespidae** are a large (nearly 5000 species), diverse, cosmopolitan family of wasps, 
> including the known eusocial wasps (such as Polistes fuscatus, Vespa orientalis, and Vespula germanica) 
> and many solitary wasps. 
> 
> Each social wasp colony includes a queen 
> and a number of female workers with varying degrees of sterility relative to the queen. 
> In temperate social species, colonies usually last only one year, dying at the onset of winter. 
> 
> New queens and males (drones) are produced towards the end of the summer, 
> and after mating, the queens hibernate over winter in cracks or other sheltered locations. 
> The nests of most species are constructed out of mud, but polistines and vespines use plant fibers, 
> chewed to form a sort of paper (also true of some stenogastrines). 
> 
> Many species are pollen vectors contributing to the pollination of several plants, 
> being potential or even effective pollinators, 
> while others are notable predators of pest insect species, and a few species are invasive pests.
>
> The subfamilies Polistinae and Vespinae are composed solely of eusocial species, while the Eumeninae, Euparagiinae, Gayellinae, Masarinae and Zethinae are all solitary with the exception of a few communal and several subsocial species. The Stenogastrinae are facultatively eusocial, considering nests may have one or several adult females; in cases where the nest is shared by multiple females (typically, a mother and her daughters) there is reproductive division of labor and cooperative brood care.

> In the Polistinae and Vespinae, rather than consuming prey directly, prey are premasticated and fed to the larvae, which in return, produce a clear liquid (with high amino acid content) for the adults to consume; the exact amino acid composition varies considerably among species, but it is considered to contribute substantially to adult nutrition.

> Fossils are known since Aptian of the Early Cretaceous, with several described species from Cretaceous amber.
