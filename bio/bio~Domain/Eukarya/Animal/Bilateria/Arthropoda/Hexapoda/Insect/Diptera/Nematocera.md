> The **Nematocera** (nemato+cera meaning "thread-horns") 
> are a suborder of elongated flies with thin, segmented antennae 
> and mostly aquatic larvae. 
> 
> This group is paraphyletic, containing all flies 
> except for those of the suborder Brachycera (the name meaning "short-horns"), 
> which includes species such as the housefly or the common fruit fly. 
> 
> Thus, the equivalent clade to Nematocera would be the whole of Diptera, 
> with Brachycera as a "subclade". Families in Nematocera include 
> mosquitoes, crane flies, gnats, black flies, and multiple families commonly known as midges. 
>
> The nematoceran imago typically have elongated bodies and legs, 
> and many species have relatively long abdomens. 
> They also have fairly long, fine, finely-jointed antennae; in many species, 
> such as most mosquitoes, the female antennae are more or less threadlike, 
> but the males have spectacularly feather-like or plumose antennae.
>
> The larvae of most nematoceran families are aquatic, either 
> free-swimming, rock-dwelling, plant-dwelling, or luticolous (mud-dwelling). 
> 
> Some families however, are not aquatic; for instance 
> the Tipulidae tend to be soil-dwelling and 
> the Mycetophilidae feed on fungi such as mushrooms. 
> 
> Unlike most of the Brachycera, the larvae of Nematocera have distinct heads 
> with mouthparts that may be modified for filter feeding or chewing, 
> depending on their lifestyles. 
> 
> The pupae are orthorrhaphous which means that 
> adults emerge from the pupa through a straight, 
> longitudinal seam in the dorsal surface of the pupal cuticle.
>
> Males of many species form mating swarms resembling faint pillars of smoke, competing for females that visit the cloud of males to find a mate.
