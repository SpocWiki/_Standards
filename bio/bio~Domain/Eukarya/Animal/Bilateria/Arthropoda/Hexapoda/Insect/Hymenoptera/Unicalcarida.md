> Hymenoptera is a large order of insects, comprising the sawflies, wasps, bees, and ants. 
> Over 150,000 living species of Hymenoptera have been described, in addition to over 2,000 extinct ones. Many of the species are parasitic. 
>
> Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or places that are otherwise inaccessible. This ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)â€”that is, they have a wormlike larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they reach adulthood.
