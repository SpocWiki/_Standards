# [[Ichneumonidae]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Ichneumonidae**, also known as ichneumon wasps, ichneumonid wasps, ichneumonids, or Darwin wasps, 
> are a family of parasitoid wasps of the insect order Hymenoptera. 
> 
> They are one of the most diverse groups within the Hymenoptera 
> with roughly 25,000 species described as of 2016. 
> 
> However, this likely represents less than a quarter of their true richness 
> as reliable estimates are lacking, 
> along with much of the most basic knowledge about their 
> ecology, distribution, and evolution. 
> 
> It is estimated that there are more species in this family 
> than there are species of birds and mammals combined. 
> 
> Ichneumonid wasps, with very few exceptions, 
> attack the immature stages of holometabolous insects and spiders, eventually killing their hosts. 
> 
> They play an important role as regulators of insect populations, 
> both in natural and semi-natural systems, 
> making them promising agents for biological control.
>
> The distribution of the ichneumonids was traditionally considered an exception to the common latitudinal gradient in species diversity, since the family was thought to be at its most species-rich in the temperate zone instead of the tropics, but numerous new tropical species have now been discovered.
