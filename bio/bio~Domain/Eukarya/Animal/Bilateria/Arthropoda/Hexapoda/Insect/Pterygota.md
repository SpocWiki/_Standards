## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pterygota** ( terrə-GOH-tə Ancient Greek: πτερυγωτός, romanized: pterugōtós, lit. 'winged') 
> is a subclass of insects that includes all winged insects and groups who lost them secondarily.
>
> Pterygota group comprises 99.9% of all insects. 
> The orders not included are the Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) 
> and the Zygentoma (silverfishes and firebrats), two primitively wingless insect orders. 
> 
> Unlike Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, 
> the pterygotes do not have styli or vesicles on their abdomen (also absent in some zygentomans), 
> and with the exception of the majority of mayflies, 
> are also missing the median terminal filament which is present in the ancestrally wingless insects.
>
> The oldest known representatives of the group appeared during the mid-Carboniferous, 
> around 328–324 million years ago, and the group subsequently underwent rapid diversification. 
> Claims that they originated substantially earlier during the Silurian or Devonian 
> based on molecular clock estimates are unlikely based on the fossil record, and are likely analytical artefacts.

### Information on the Internet

-   [The Development of Insect     Flight](http://park.org/Canada/Museum/insects/entry.html)

## Introduction

Insects were the first organisms on Earth to evolve active flight. It is
likely that the ability to fly arose only once in insects, over 300
million years ago in the Carboniferous period. About 70 million years
later active flight arose within vertebrates (pterosaurs), followed by
separate origins in birds and bats.

Winged insects, or pterygotes, have radiated into over 100 times more
species than all of the winged vertebrate lineages combined. They
include all of the commonly encountered insects; the most common
non-pterygote insect lineage are the Thysanura (silverfish and
firebrats).

Many groups of insects have subsequently lost the ability to fly. Some
of these (lice and fleas, for example) have lost all remnants of wings.
It is only through their evident relationship with particular groups of
winged insects (lice are closely related to psocids \[book lice\]; fleas
are related to flies) that it is clear that their ancestors had wings.

### Characteristics

The primary derived characteristic of pterygotes is the presence of
veined wings on the second (meso-) and third (meta-) thoracic segment.

### Paleopterous and neopterous insects

Two groups of pterygotes evolved the ability to fold their wings back
flat against their abdomens. The largest of these is the clade
[Neoptera](tree?group=Neoptera&contgroup=Pterygota)
(\"new wing\"). Remaining insects (all of the taxa in the above tree
except for Neoptera) are sometimes referred to as Paleoptera (\"old
wing\"), because they lack the sophisticated wing-folding mechanism of
neopterous insects. Members of paleopterous insects cannot fold their
wings back over their abdomens, with the exception of the extinct order
[Diaphonopterodea](tree?group=Diaphanopterodea&contgroup=Paleodictyopteroidea),
which could fold their wings using a mechanism different than Neoptera.
(Some neopterous insects, such as butterflies, can no longer fold their
wings against their abdomen, but this clearly represents a secondary
loss.)

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

While the relationships of the extinct paleodictyopteroid orders
(Diaphanopterodea, Paleodictyoptera, Megasecoptera, and Permothemistida)
to each other and to other orders have not been extensively examined,
the relationships of the three living lineages (Ephemeroptera, Odonata,
and Neoptera) to each other have been the subject of much debate. Each
of the three possible relationships are supported by various authors.

A monophyletic Paleoptera was advocated by Hennig (1969, 1981) and
Hovmöller et al. (2002):

                      === Odonata
         ==Paleoptera=|
    =====|            === Ephemeroptera
         |
         ================ Neoptera

Boudreaux (1979) favored monophyly of Ephemeroptera + Neoptera:

         ====== Odonata
         |
    =====|  === Ephemeroptera
         ===|
            === Neoptera

Kristensen (1975, 1981, 1991) and Wheeler et al. (2001) present evidence
in support of monophyly of Odonata + Neoptera:

         ====== Ephemeroptera
         |
    =====|  === Odonata
         ===|
            === Neoptera
