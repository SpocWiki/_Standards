> Drosophila melanogaster is a species of fly (an insect of the order Diptera) 
> in the family Drosophilidae. 
> The species is often referred to as the fruit fly or lesser fruit fly, 
> or less commonly the "vinegar fly", "pomace fly", or "banana fly". 
> 
> In the wild, D. melanogaster are attracted to rotting fruit and fermenting beverages, 
> and they are often found in orchards, kitchens and pubs.
>
> Starting with Charles W. Woodworth's 1901 proposal 
> of the use of this species as a model organism, 
> D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, 
> physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. 
> 
> D. melanogaster was the first animal to be launched into space in 1947. 
> As of 2017, six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to drosophilists 
> for their work using the insect.
>
> Drosophila melanogaster is typically used in research owing to its rapid life cycle, 
> relatively simple genetics with only four pairs of chromosomes, 
> and large number of offspring per generation. 
> 
> It was originally an African species, with all non-African lineages having a common origin. 
> Its geographic range includes all continents, including islands. 
> D. melanogaster is a common pest in homes, restaurants, 
> and other places where food is served.
>
> Flies belonging to the family Tephritidae are also called "fruit flies". 
> This can cause confusion, especially in the Mediterranean, Australia, and South Africa, 
> where the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata is an economic pest.
