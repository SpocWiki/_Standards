# [[Polyphaga]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Polyphaga** is the largest and most diverse suborder of beetles. 
> It comprises 144 families in 16 superfamilies, 
> and displays an enormous variety of specialization and adaptation, 
> with over 350,000 described species, or approximately 90% of the beetle species discovered thus far.
>
> Key characteristics of Polyphaga are 
> that the hind coxa (base of the leg) does not divide the first and second abdominal/ventral plates 
> which are known as sternites. 
> Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present.
