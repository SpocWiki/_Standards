> A **Midge** is any small fly, including species in 
> several families of non-mosquito nematoceran Diptera. 
> 
> Midges are found (seasonally or otherwise) on practically 
> every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the frigid zones.  
> 
> Some midges, such as many Phlebotominae (sand fly) and Simuliidae (black fly), 
> are vectors of various diseases. 
> 
> Many others play useful roles as prey for insectivores, such as various 
> frogs and swallows. 
> 
> Others are important as detritivores, and form part of various nutrient cycles. 
> 
> The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, 
> though within any given family midges commonly have similar ecological roles.
>
> Examples of families that include species of midges include:
> - Blephariceridae, net-winged midges
> - Cecidomyiidae, gall midges
> - Ceratopogonidae, biting midges (also known as no-see-ums or punkies in North America and sandflies in Australia)
> - Chaoboridae, phantom midges
> - Chironomidae, non-biting midges (also known as muckleheads, muffleheads or lake flies in the Great Lakes region of North America)
> - Deuterophlebiidae, mountain midges
> - Dixidae, meniscus midges
> - Scatopsidae, dung midges
> - Thaumaleidae, solitary midges
