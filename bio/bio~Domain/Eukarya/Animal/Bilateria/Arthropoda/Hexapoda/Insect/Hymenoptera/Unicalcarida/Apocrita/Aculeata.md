## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Aculeata** is an infraorder of Hymenoptera containing ants, bees, and stinging wasps. 
> The name is a reference to the defining feature of the group, 
> which is the modification of the ovipositor into a stinger. 
> 
> However, many members of the group cannot sting, 
> either retaining the ovipositor, or having lost it altogether. 
> A large part of the clade is parasitic.
>
> This group includes all of the eusocial Hymenopterans.
>
> The oldest aculeates are known from the Late Jurassic Karabastau Formation of Kazakhstan, 
> represented by the family Bethylonymidae, which may be para- or polyphyletic.
