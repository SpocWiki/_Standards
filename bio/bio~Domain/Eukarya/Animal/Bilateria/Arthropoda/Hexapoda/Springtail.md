## Introduction

Springtails have the widest distribution of any hexapod group, occuring
throughout the world, including Antarctica. They are probably the most
abundant hexapods on Earth, with up to 250,000,000 individuals per
square acre. They are found in soil, leaf litter, logs, dung, cave,
shorelines, etc. There are about 6000 known species.

Devonian-Recent. Oldest fossil is of Rhyniella praecursor Hirst and
Maulik from the Middle Devonian of Scotland.

The name \"Collembola\" is derived from \"Colle\" = glue and \"embolon\"
= piston or peg. This refers to the belief that the ventral tube has
adhesive properties, that is, that it is a \"glue-peg\". However, the
tube\'s function is primarily for excretion and maintaining water
balance.

### Characteristics

Among the prominent derived characteristics of this group are:

-   ventral tube (\"collophore\") on segment 1 of abdomen (adhesive in
    some groups, but primarily involved with excretion and water
    transport)
-   springing mechanism formed from retinaculum on segment 3, furcula on
    segment 4
-   4-segmented antennae (segments sometimes subsegmented, giving the
    appearance of more than 4 segments)
-   6 abdominal segments

Other characteristics include:

-   indirect sperm transfer with globular stalked spermatophore
-   Some Neanuridae have polytene chromosomes
-   Adults continue moulting throughout life (up to 50 moults)
-   Reproductive instars alternate with feeding instars
-   Cerci lacking
