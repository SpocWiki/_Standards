> The subphylum **Chelicerata** (from Neo-Latin, from French  chélicère, 
> from Ancient Greek  χηλή (khēlḗ) 'claw, chela' and  κέρας (kéras) 'horn') 
> constitutes one of the major subdivisions of the phylum Arthropoda. 
> 
> Chelicerates include the sea spiders, horseshoe crabs, and arachnids 
> (including harvestmen, scorpions, spiders, solifuges, ticks, and mites, among many others), 
> as well as a number of extinct lineages, such as the eurypterids (sea scorpions) and chasmataspidids.
>
> Chelicerata  split from Mandibulata by the mid-Cambrian, 
> as evidenced by stem-group chelicerates like Habeliida and Mollisonia present by this time. 
> The surviving marine species include the four species of xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs), 
> and possibly the 1,300 species of pycnogonids (sea spiders), if the latter are indeed chelicerates. 
> 
> On the other hand, there are over 77,000 well-identified species of air-breathing chelicerates, 
> and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species.
>
> Like all arthropods, chelicerates have segmented bodies with jointed limbs, 
> all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins. 
> 
> The chelicerate body plan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma – 
> excepting the mites, which have lost any visible division between these sections. 
> 
> The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the oldest and most basal group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.
>
> Chelicerates were originally predators, but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects.
>
> While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Many species use elaborate courtship rituals to attract mates. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.
>
> The evolutionary origins of chelicerates from the early arthropods have been debated for decades. Although there is considerable agreement about the relationships between most chelicerate sub-groups, the inclusion of the Pycnogonida in this taxon has been questioned, and the exact position of scorpions is still controversial, though they were long considered the most basal of the arachnids.
>
> Venom has evolved three times in the chelicerates; spiders, scorpions and pseudoscorpions, or four times if the hematophagous secretions produced by ticks are included. In addition there have been unverified descriptions of venom glands in Solifugae. Chemical defense has been found in whip scorpions, shorttailed whipscorpions, harvestmen, beetle mites and sea spiders.
>
> Although the venom of a few spider and scorpion species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating the use of these venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.
