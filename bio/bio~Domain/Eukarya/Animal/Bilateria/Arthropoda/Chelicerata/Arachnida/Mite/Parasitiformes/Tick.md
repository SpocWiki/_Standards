## Introduction

[Anna Murrell and Steve Barker](http://www.tolweb.org/)

Ticks are blood-feeding parasites of 
[- reptiles](tree?group=Amniota&contgroup=Terrestrial_Vertebrates),
- [birds](tree?group=Aves&contgroup=Coelurosauria),
- [mammals](tree?group=Mammalia&contgroup=Therapsida) and even
- [amphibians](tree?group=Living_Amphibians&contgroup=Terrestrial_Vertebrates)
(one tick species only). 

Ticks are generally much larger than other mites; 
engorged female ticks of some species reach 30 mm in size (Evans, 1992). 

Ticks transmit more infectious agents than any other blood-feeding arthropods (Hoogstraal, 1985), 
including *Borrelia burgdorgeri* (Lyme disease), *B. recurrentis* (relapsing fever),
*Babesia* spp. (tick fever), and *Rickettsia connorii* (boutenneuse fever). 

Other forms of pathogenesis attributed to ticks are anaemia
(e.g. *Hyalomma asiaticum* females consume more than 8 ml of blood per tick; Sonenshine, 1991) 
as well as dermatosis and paralysis (Roberts and Janovy, 1996).

There are approximately 860 spp. in 22 genera and three families
(Keirans, 1992; Keirans and Robbins, 1999). The Ixodidae and Argasidae
are large and cosmopolitan families, whereas the Nuttalliellidae has one
species which has only been found in South Africa and Tanzania (Evans,
1992). The main host of *Nuttalliella namaqua* is uncertain, as is the
life cycle (Oliver, 1989). Most ixodid ticks have three hosts, one for
each stage of the life cycle (larvae, nymph and adult), but in some
species this has been reduced (one- or two-host ticks spend two or more
life cycle stages on the same host individual) (Oliver, 1989). Ixodid
ticks need several days to feed, and once the female is engorged she
drops from the host to lay eggs (up to many thousand). Argasid ticks
only feed intermittently and do not remain attached to their hosts. They
may feed many times over their lifetime on a number of different hosts
and will often lay only a few hundred eggs. Argasid ticks also have
remarkable longevity and have been observed to live for many years and
long periods of starvation (Sonenshine, 1991).

### Characteristics

According to Lehtinen (1991) the following characters are synapomorphic
for the Ixodida:

i.  latigynial plates reduced;
ii. palpal tarsus reduced;
iii. hypostome projecting and sawlike.

Other prominent features of ticks are their large size, when compared to
other mites, and Haller\'s organ, a complex sensory apparatus on tarsus
1 (the holothyridan mites have a homologous organ).

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

The phylogenetic relationships of the three families of ticks, the
Argasidae, Ixodidae and Nuttalliellidae, are unresolved. The
monospecific Nuttalliellidae (*Nuttalliella namaqua*) has morphological
features of both the Argasidae and Ixodidae (Keirans et al., 1976), so
its relationship to them phylogenetically is unclear. Although molecular
analyses of the phylogenetic relationships of the Argasidae and Ixodidae
have been done (e.g. Black and Piesman, 1994; Black et al., 1997; Dobson
and Barker, 1999), these studies did not include the Nuttalliellidae
because few individuals of *N. namaqua* have ever been found (Roshdy et
al., 1983), and they have not been available for molecular applications.
