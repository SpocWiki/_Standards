> The **Opiliones** (formerly Phalangida) are an order of arachnids,
> colloquially known as harvestmen, harvesters, or daddy long legs. 
> Over 6,650 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, 
> although the total number of extant species may exceed 10,000. 
> 
> The order Opiliones includes five suborders: 
> Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and Tetrophthalmi, which were named in 2014.
>
> Representatives of each extant suborder can be found on all continents except Antarctica.
>
> Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million-year-old Rhynie cherts of Scotland, 
> and 305-million-year-old rocks in France. 
> These fossils look surprisingly modern, 
> indicating that their basic body shape developed very early on, 
> and, at least in some taxa, has changed little since that time.
>
> Their phylogenetic position within the Arachnida is disputed; 
> their closest relatives may be camel spiders (Solifugae) 
> or a larger clade comprising horseshoe crabs, Ricinulei, and Arachnopulmonata 
> (scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and Tetrapulmonata). 
> 
> Although superficially similar to and often misidentified as spiders (order Araneae), 
> the Opiliones are a distinct order that is not closely related to spiders. 
> 
> They can be easily distinguished from long-legged spiders by their fused body regions 
> and single pair of eyes in the middle of the cephalothorax. 
> Spiders have a distinct abdomen that is separated from the cephalothorax by a constriction, 
> and they have three to four pairs of eyes, usually around the margins of the cephalothorax.
