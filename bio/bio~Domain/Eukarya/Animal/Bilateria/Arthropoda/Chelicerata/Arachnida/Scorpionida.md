## Introduction

[Scott A. Stockwell]()

Scorpions are easily distinguished from other arachnids by their large,
well developed claws (pedipalps) and distinct division of the abdomen
(opisthosoma) into a broad preabdomen (mesosoma) and narrow, tail-like
postabdomen (metasoma). All scorpions possess a poisonous sting (telson)
and a pair of peculiar, comb-like, sensory appendages called pectens.

There about 1100 species of scorpions known worldwide, and probably that
many more still to be discovered. Although they are normally associated
with hot, dry areas like deserts, scorpions are found in a variety of
habitats including cool, wet forests and grasslands.

Scorpions are among the oldest arachnids. The earliest fossils date from
the middle Silurian rocks, over 400 million years old. Early scorpions
had large compound eyes, but were otherwise similar to living forms.

Scorpions are generally large arachnids. Adults range in size from 1.5
cm to 21 cm in length. Some fossil scorpions are thought to have been up
to 1 meter in length! All are predatory. Their prey includes a variety
of arthropods and other invertebrates, and the larger species are known
to prey on small vertebrates.

The scorpion\'s most notorious feature is its poisonous sting. While all
scorpions are venomous, only about twenty species worldwide possess
venom of sufficient toxicity to kill humans.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

The phylogeny of the Scorpionida is highly controversial. The
phylogenies shown here and on subsequent pages are based on my
dissertation work (Stockwell 1989). They are provisional, though the
corresponding classification has already been adopted by some fossil
workers (Selden 1993, Jeram 1994). The placement of the Scorpionida is
disputed among workers. The most recent phylogeny (Shultz 1990) places
the Scorpionida as the sister group of the Pseudoscorpiones + Solifugae,
but other workers, including myself, consider the recent scorpions
(Scorpiones) to be the sister group of all other arachnids, or an
altogether separate eurypterid clade. Unfortunately, this will remain
difficult to test due to the lack of resolution in the otherwise
obviously paraphyletic Eurypterida.

In an effort to rectify the fossil and recent classifications of
scorpions, which were hitherto incompatible (Kjellesvig-Waering, 1986),
I proposed to raise the Scorpionida to the rank of class with three
orders, Protoscorpiones, Palaeoscorpiones, and Scorpiones (Stockwell
1989). The strictly phenetic suborders and infraorders of
Kjellesvig-Waering (1986) were largely abandoned.

The fossil group, Protoscorpiones, is not demonstrably monophyletic, but
is included for the sake of completeness and clarity. They possess the
most plesiomorphic, euypterid-like legs and sternocoxal arrangements, as
well as well-develpoed lateral compound eyes. It is possible that these
early scorpions are the actual ancestors of other groups. Geological
range: middle Silurian to lower Devonian.

The fossil group, Palaeoscorpiones, possesses an enlarged prosomal
sternum that completely separates the midcoxae. Their legs are
cylindrical, like those of eurypterids and protoscorpions, but the tarsi
are showing plantigrade features that could be considered land
adaptations. Could the Palaeoscorpiones share a most recent common
ancestor with the non-scorpion arachnids? Geological range: upper
Silurian to middle Carboniferous.

The group Scorpiones encompasses most known scorpions, both fossil and
Recent. All show development of an increasingly sophisticated preoral
chamber comprised of the first and second leg coxae. The reduction of
compound eyes and loss of one pair (and in some extinct groups, two
pair) of pulmonary books (and the corresponding fusion of opisthosomal
sternites), so characteristic of modern scorpions, occurs in this group.
Scorpiones contains a great many fossil specimens that I consider
*incertae sedis*. Some might one day be classified, but most lack
critical characters that could be used to ally them with any group more
inclusive than the Scorpiones. Geological range: lower Devonian to
Recent.
