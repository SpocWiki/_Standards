## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dromopoda** is a proposed subclass of the arachnids, including 
> Opiliones (harvestmen), Scorpions, Pseudoscorpions and Solifugae ("camel spiders"). 
> 
> The latter three are sometimes grouped as Novogenuata. 
> This taxon was first proposed by Jeffrey Shultz in 1990 based on morphological analysis. 
> 
> A combined morphological and molecular analysis in 1998 supported the monophyly of Dromopoda. 
> 
> However, subsequent molecular and combined analyses have not supported the monophyly of Dromopoda.
