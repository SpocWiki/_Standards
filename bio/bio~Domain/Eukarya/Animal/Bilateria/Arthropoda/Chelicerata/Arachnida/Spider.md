## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Spiders (order **Araneae**) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, 
> chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk. 
> 
> They are the largest order of arachnids 
> and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms. 
> 
> Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except Antarctica, 
> and have become established in nearly every land habitat. 
> 
> As of June 2025, 53,034 spider species in 136 families have been recorded by taxonomists. 
> However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, 
> with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.
>
> Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods 
> in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, 
> - the cephalothorax or prosoma, and 
> - the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and 
> - joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. 
> However, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence 
> that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, 
> there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, 
> which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax. 
> Similarly, arguments can be formed against the use of the term "abdomen", 
> as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, 
> organs atypical of an abdomen.
>
> Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. 
> In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, 
> spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, 
> as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. 
> 
> Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs 
> and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.
>
> Their abdomens bear appendages, 
> modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands. 
> 
> Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used. 
> It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, 
> and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders. 
> 
> Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots (Uraraneida) appeared in the Devonian period, 
> about 386 million years ago, but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets. 
> 
> True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago 
> and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae. 
> The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, 
> first appeared in the Triassic period, more than 200 million years ago.
>
> The species Bagheera kiplingi was described as herbivorous in 2008, 
> but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and other spiders, 
> although a few large species also take birds and lizards. 
> 
> An estimated 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey every year. 
> 
> Spiders use numerous strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, 
> lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. 
> 
> Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision 
> and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics 
> and ability to develop new ones. 
> 
> Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, 
> so they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. 
> They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, 
> as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.
>
> To avoid being eaten by the females, which are typically much larger, 
> male spiders identify themselves as potential mates by a variety of complex courtship rituals. 
> 
> Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. 
> Females weave silk egg cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. 
> Females of many species care for their young, 
> for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. 
> 
> A minority of species are social, building communal webs 
> that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. 
> 
> Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, 
> to cooperative hunting and food-sharing. 
> 
> Although most spiders live for at most two years, 
> tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity.
>
> While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, 
> scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. 
> 
> Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity 
> superior to synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants 
> to see if these can be used as silk factories. 
> 
> As a result of their wide range of behaviors, 
> spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology, 
> symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. 
> An irrational fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.
