> Krill (Euphausiids) (sg.: krill) are small and exclusively marine crustaceans of the order **Euphausiacea**, found 
> in all of the world's oceans. 
> 
> The name "krill" comes from the Norwegian word krill, meaning "small fry of fish", 
> which is also often attributed to species of fish.
>
> Krill are considered an important trophic level connection near the bottom of the food chain. 
> They feed on phytoplankton and, to a lesser extent, zooplankton, 
> and are also the main source of food for many larger animals. 
> 
> In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, 
> makes up an estimated biomass of around 379 million tonnes, 
> making it among the species with the largest total biomass. 
> 
> Over half of this biomass is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, seabirds, squid, and fish each year. 
> Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, 
> providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.
>
> Krill are fished commercially in the Southern Ocean and in the waters around Japan. 
> The total global harvest amounts to 150,000–200,000 tonnes annually, mostly from the Scotia Sea. 
> 
> Most krill catch is used for aquaculture and aquarium feeds, as bait in sport fishing, 
> or in the pharmaceutical industry. 
> 
> Krill are also used for human consumption in several countries. 
> They are known as okiami (オキアミ) in Japan and as camarones in Spain and the Philippines. 
> In the Philippines, they are also called alamang and are used to make a salty paste called bagoong.
>
> Krill are also the main food for baleen whales, including the blue whale.
