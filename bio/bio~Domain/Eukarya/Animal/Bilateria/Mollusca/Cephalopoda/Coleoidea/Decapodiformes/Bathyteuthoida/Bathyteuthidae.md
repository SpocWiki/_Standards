## Introduction

Squids of the Bathyteuthidae are small, (less than 80 mm ML), compact
animals of the deep sea. They have a deep reddish maroon pigmentation,
short arms and somewhat tubular eyes directed anteriorly. The fins are
small, round and separate. A small photophore is embedded at the base of
each of the arms I-III. The **Bathyteuthis** species occupy the lower
mesopelagic to bathypelagic depth zones, and they are scattered
throughout the world's oceans.

------------------------

#### Diagnosis

A member of the bathyteuthid families \...

-   with buccal connectives attaching to dorsal border of arms IV.
-   with small, separate, paddle-like fins.

### Characteristics

1.  Arms
    a.  Arms short, joined by a low, fleshy web.
    b.  Arms I-III with 2 longitudinal series of suckers proximally,
        increasing to 4 series of irregularly placed suckers distally in
        adults.

        of **B. abyssicola**, Hawaiian waters. Suckers on the dorsal six
        arms are in two series at the base of each arm but merge into
        four series distally. Note the web between the arms. Photograph
        by R. Young.
    c.  Buccal connectives attach to dorsal border of arms IV.
2.  Tentacles
    a.  Tentacular club short, unexpanded, with 8-10 longitudinal series
        of numerous, minute suckers.
3.  Head
    a.  Eyes semitubular, anteriorly directed.

        **B. abyssicola** showing forward-looking eyes and photophores
        (arrow) at the bases of the arms. Photograph by R. Young,
        R/V G. O. Sars, Mar-Eco cruise, North Atlantic.
4.  Funnel
    a.  mantle-funnel locking apparatus with a simple, straight ridge
        and groove.

        Funnel locking-aparatus of **B. abyssicola** from Hawaiian
        waters. Photograph by R. Young. Right - Locking-apparatus of
        **B. bacidifera**. Ventral view of the funnel component on the
        left and dorsal view of the mantle component on the right.
        Drawing of from Roper (1968).
5.  Fins
    a.  Fins small, separate, round with anterior and posterior lobes.
6.  Photophores
    a.  Arms I-III with a single, simple photophore embedded in the
        subcutaneous aboral tissue at the bases (see Figure above).

#### Comments

Species of **Bathyteuthis** have a peculiar pore just anterior to the
funnel that lies between the embedded funnel adductor muscles. This pore
leads into a short canal that bifurcates then each branch ends blindly.
The function of this structure is unknown.

### Nomenclature

**Bathyteuthis** was erected as a new genus by Hoyle (1885a) for a new
species of deep sea squid (**B. abyssicola**) captured from 2900 m
during the CHALLENGER Expedition. It was caught in the Southern Ocean,
Indian Ocean segment, between the subantarctic islands of Crozets Island
and Prince Edward Island. In the same year Verrill (1885) described a
new genus and species, **Benthoteuthis megalops**, captured the previous
year by the ALBATROSS in 1960 m off Martha's Vineyard, New England.

Neither author designated a family for these new genera. Hoyle (1885b)
immediately recognized that **Benthoteuthis** was a synonym of
**Bathyteuthis** (which had publication priority by 2 months), and he
mentioned in 1886 the possibility that the two species might be
conspecific. But it was not until 1900 that Pfeffer actually synonymized
**B. megalops** with **B. abyssicola** when he erected the Family
Bathyteuthidae.

The family also contained another unusual genus, **Chtenopteryx**, which
eventually was separated as a subfamily by Grimpe in 1922 and elevated
to family Chtenopterygidae by Allen (1945). Two additional species were
described in 1968 by Roper: **Bathyteuthis bacidifera** and
**Bathyteuthis berryi**, and the family was monographed by Roper (1969).

[A list of all nominal genera and species in the Bathyteuthidae can be found here](http://www.tolweb.org/accessory/Bathyteuthidae_Taxa?acc_id=1799).
The list includes the current status and type species of all genera, and
the current status, type repository and type locality of all species and
all pertinent references.

### Life History

The paralarva is easily recognized by the tentacle and arm IV bases that
extend well posterior to the bases of arms I-III. The position of the
digestive gland is well posterior to the cephalic cartilage but it is
not visible through the mantle of the preserved paralarva.

bases of the tentacles and arms IV lie. The bases of arms I-III lie

Hawaiian waters by R. Young. Bar = 1 mm.

### Unusual features

**Bathyteuthis** spp. have large, orange-colored photosensitive vesicles
just posterior to the forward-looking eye. The photosensitive vesicles
are extra-ocular photoreceptors that apparently monitor bioluminescent
light arising outside of the visual field, including the mantle cavity.
In the latter case, small, luminescent organisms inadvertently drawn
into the mantle cavity with the respiratory current could reveal the
presence of the squid to potential predators in the dark waters of the
deep-sea. The photosensitive vesicles of **Bathyteuthis** are among the
largest known in any cephalopod.
