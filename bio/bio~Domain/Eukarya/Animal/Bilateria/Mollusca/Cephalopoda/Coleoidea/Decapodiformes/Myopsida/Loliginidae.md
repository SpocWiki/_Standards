# Loliginidae [Lesueur, 1821] 

[Michael Vecchione]()

![ ](Loliginidae/EGGMASS.jpg)

At present the Loliginidae is divided into ten genera with 42 nominal
species. The generic affinities of three species currently are not
resolved.

Containing group:[Myopsida](../Myopsida.md) 

## Introduction

The family Loliginidae includes many species that are important in
trophic systems, fisheries, and biomedical studies. Brakoniecki (1996)
merged the Pickfordiateuthidae with the Loliginidae.

Loliginids are mostly neritic squids (i.e., they occupy waters over the
continental shelves). Most are very muscular, \"squid-like\" in
appearance and range in size from about 3 to 100 cm ML. All members of
the family have a cornea that covers the lens of each eye. Among
decapods, this feature is shared with all members of the Sepioidea but
is absent in all oegopsid squids. Loliginids differ from sepioids in
having a gladius that extends the full length of the mantle and a gill
that (except in ***Pickfordiateuthis***) has a branchial canal.

#### Diagnosis

A myposid \...

-   with straight funnel locking-apparatus.
-   with mantle locking-apparatus reaching mantle margin.

### Characteristics

#### Comments

The morphology of the gladius, as used formerly to distinguish the genus
***Doryteuthis***, is no longer considered to be of generic importance,
although it is important at the specific level (see also Alexeyev,
1989). The gladius is quite variable, both within and among species, and
could be highly adaptive in response to differences in swimming
behavior. Other traditional characters that Vecchione et al. (1998)
consider too variable to be of use in the generic systematics of the
Loliginidae include spermatophore deposition site, presence of suckers
on the buccal lappets, adult chromatophore patterns (e.g. lateral
\"flame stripes\"), and presence of a longitudinal mid-ventral ridge on
the mantle. 

Although the preliminary generic classification of Vecchione et al.
(1998) represented an important step toward consensus on the genera of
this family, subsequent analyses of DNA sequences (Anderson 2000) have
indicated that a holophyletic classification requires recognician of
generic-level species groups defined primarily on distributional
characteristics.

### Nomenclature

Lesueur (1821) erected a family that he called Loligoidea (afterwards
emended to Loliginidae, see Vecchione et al., 1998) to fit the
\"Loligos\" (***Leachia***, ***Loligo*** and ***Onykia***) into
Cuvier\'s \"natural order\". He stated (Lesueur, 1821:88)\--

\"It is of little consequence what characters we select for the
distribution of these animals into families and genera, if our
arrangement is the most convenient, and exhibits, as near as possible, a
graded transition from one to the other.\"

A consequence of the age of this family and its early inclusion of all
squids is that many taxa, both correctly and incorrectly described, have
been considered loliginids at one time or another. [A summary of this history is found here](http://www.tolweb.org/accessory/Loliginid_Nomenclatural_History?acc_id=1306).
Therefore, taxonomic nomenclature in the squid literature can be very
confusing.

A thorough nomenclatural review of the family can be found in Sweeney
and Vecchione (1998).

[A list of all nominal genera and species in the Loliginidae can be found here](http://www.tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2326). The list
includes the current status and type species of all genera, and the
current status, type repository and type locality of all species and all
pertinent references.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

The systematics of the myopsid squid family Loliginidae have long been
in disorder. In addition to many problems with differentiation of
species, loliginid systematics have been hampered throughout the past
several decades by the presence of two systems of generic-level
classification. The differences between these two systems primarily
involved a question of the importance of gladius structure at the
generic level. Both systems have been used widely in the scientific
literature, although many authors consistently qualified their use by
stating that the family was badly in need of revision based upon a
worldwide review.

Three separate morphological revisions have been completed (Natsukari,
1984b; Brakoniecki, 1986; Alexeyev, 1991); all concluded that a correct
generic-level classification of the family is radically different from
either of the previous classifications. Unfortunately, these new
classifications also differed substantially from each other, were
presented in unpublished dissertations and not widely disseminated, and
none has gained full acceptance.

Obviously, the existence of five contrasting systems of classification
can cause hopeless confusion to researchers studing these squids, in
addition to obfuscating real relationships among the species. Species
groupings into subgenera and genera have been based only on similarity.
In a workshop publication, Vecchione et al. (1998), recognized six
genera. Four of the genera are divided into subgenera:
***Lolliguncula*** (***Lolliguncula*** and ***Loliolopsis***);
***Uroteuthis*** (***Uroteuthis*** and ***Photololigo***);
***Loliolus*** (***Loliolus*** and ***Nipponololigo***); ***Loligo***
(***Loligo*** and ***Alloteuthis***). The generic affinities of several
species were unresolved.

A follow-up workshop consensus on generic and sub-generic taxonomy of
the family was published by Vecchione et al. (2005), based primarily on
the phylogenetic research of Anderson (1996; 2000a; 2000b) and Alexeyev
(1989; 1991).  Both of those authors built upon the previous workshop
proceedings.  The most noteworthy differences in Vecchione et al. (2005)
from the classification of Vecchione et al. (1998) include the
following: (1) removal of ***mercatoris*** from ***Lolliguncula*** based
primarily on gladius characters, DNA sequence data and biogeography, and
recognition of ***Afrololigo*** Brakoniecki as a valid genus for this
species; (2) elevation of ***Alloteuthis*** Wülker from sub-generic to
full generic status based on gladius structure and DNA sequence data;
(3) removal of American species from the genus ***Loligo*** because DNA
sequence analyses indicate that ***Loligo*** sensu Vecchione et al. is
probably paraphyletic. The generic name with priority for the American
species is ***Doryteuthis*** Naef. This genus further comprises two
natural subgroups based on differences in gladius and hectocotylus
structure; these subgroups are considered here to be the subgenera
***Doryteuthis*** Naef and ***Amerigo*** Brakoniecki. ***Doryteuthis
sanpaulensis*** does not belong in either of these subgenera and is
therefore considered to be the sole recognized species in an undescribed
subgenus; (4) removal of ***bleekeri*** from ***Loligo*** and
recognition of ***Heterololigo*** Natsukari as a valid genus based on
DNA sequence analysis; (5) removal of ***noctiluca*** from subgenus
***Uroteuthis*** of genus ***Uroteuthis*** and recognition of
***Aestuariolus*** Alexeyev as a valid monotypic subgenus of
***Uroteuthis*** primarily because of differences in photophore
structure from the rest of the genus.

### Life History

The egg masses typically are groups of finger-like gelatinous masses
containing a few to many eggs each often woven together and always
attached to the ocean floor.\
