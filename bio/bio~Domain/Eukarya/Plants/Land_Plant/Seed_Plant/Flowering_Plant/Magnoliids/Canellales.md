## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Canellales** is the botanical name for an order of flowering plants, 
> one of the four orders of the magnoliids. 
> 
> It is recognized by the most recent classification of flowering plants, the APG IV system. 
> It is defined to contain two families: 
> Canellaceae and Winteraceae, which comprise 136 species of fragrant trees and shrubs. 
> 
> The Canellaceae are found in tropical America and Africa, 
> and the Winteraceae are part of the Antarctic flora 
> (found in diverse parts of the southern hemisphere). 
> 
> Although the order was defined based on phylogenetic studies, 
> a number of possible synapomorphies have been suggested, relating to the pollen tube, 
> the seeds, the thickness of the integument, and other aspects of the morphology.
>
> Until 1999, these two families were not considered to be closely related. 
> Instead the Winteraceae were considered to be a primitive family 
> (due to the structure of the xylem and carpel, 
> a structure which now seems to be derived from xylem and carpels more typical of the angiosperms as a whole). 
> 
> The Canellaceae was often considered to be related to the Myristicaceae. 
> However, studies starting in 1999, based on molecular phylogeny or morphology, 
> have supported uniting these two families.
