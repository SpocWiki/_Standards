## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Hornworts are a group of non-vascular Embryophytes (land plants) 
> constituting the division **Anthocerotophyta**. 
> 
> The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. 
> As in mosses and liverworts, hornworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, 
> in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information; 
> the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte stage of the plant.
>
> Hornworts may be found worldwide, though they tend to grow only in places that are damp or humid. 
> Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. 
> Large tropical and sub-tropical species of Dendroceros may be found growing on the bark of trees.
>
> The total number of species is still uncertain. 
> While there are more than 300 published species names, 
> the actual number could be as low as 100–150 species.
