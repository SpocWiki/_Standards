# [[Onagraceae]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Onagraceae** are a family of flowering plants 
> known as the willowherb family or evening primrose family. 
> They include about 650 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees in 17 genera. 
> The family is widespread, occurring on every continent from boreal to tropical regions.
>
> The family includes a number of popular garden plants, 
> including evening primroses (Oenothera) and fuchsias (Fuchsia). 
> 
> Some, particularly the willowherbs (Epilobium), are common weeds in gardens 
> and rapidly colonize disturbed habitats in the wild. 
> One such species is fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium).
>
> The family is characterised by flowers with usually four sepals and petals; 
> in some genera, such as Fuchsia, the sepals are as brightly coloured as the petals.
>
> The seeds are generally very small. 
> In some genera, such as Epilobium, they have tufts of hairs and are dispersed on the wind. 
> In others, such as Fuchsia, the seeds develop in juicy berries dispersed by animals. 
> 
> The leaves are commonly opposite or whorled, but are spirally arranged in some species; 
> in most, they are simple and lanceolate in shape. 
> 
> The pollen grains in many genera are loosely held together by viscin threads. 
> Most bees cannot collect it, and only bees with specialized morphologies 
> can effectively pollinate the flowers; 
> nearly all bee taxa that visit the flowers are oligoleges specialized on the family Onagraceae.
>
> The family was named after the genus Onagra (now known as Oenothera) 
> in 1836 by John Lindley in the second edition of A Natural System of Botany.
