## Introduction

[Martin F. Wojciechowski, Johanna Mahn, and Bruce Jones]() 

The traditional orders Fabales, Rosales, Cucurbitales, and Fagales
comprise one of the major clades within Eurosids I. This clade is
characterized by the ability of many of its members to fix atmospheric
nitrogen (N~2~) to a form usable by plants (Soltis et al. 2000). Within
this 'nitrogen-fixing' clade the monophyly of each of its subclades
receives strong support from analyses of molecular data. The monophyly
of Fabales (sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2003) and a sister group
relationship of legumes (family Fabaceae) to the families Quillajaceae,
Polygalaceae, and Surianaceae, are all strongly supported (Doyle et al.
2000), but the relationship among these lineages is not clearly resolved
at the present time.

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

Within angiosperms, Fabaceae has traditionally been considered 'rosid'
in its taxonomic relationships, with Connaraceae, Chrysobalanaceae,
Crossosomataceae, Krameriaceae, and even Sapindaceae suggested as
closely related families (potential sister groups) by different authors
at one time or another (reviewed by Dickison, 1981; Thorne, 1992). The
first challenge to these hypotheses came from the now landmark study of
Chase et al. (1993) based on cladistic analysis of the chloroplast
*rbcL* gene, which suggested Polygalaceae and Surianaceae as potential
sister groups to Fabaceae and resolved the other families as more
distantly related. A close relationship of Fabaceae to Polygalaceae (and
Surianaceae) within a more inclusive Fabales clade has been
substantiated by most subsequent angiosperm-wide analyses of molecular
data (Savolainen et al., 2000; Soltis et al., 2000). In addition,
studies focused on relationships within rosids (Soltis et al., 1995;
Steele et al., 2000; Persson, 2001) have shown the rosacean genus
*Quillaja* Molina strongly supported as a member of Fabales, although
relationships within Fabales are still only weakly resolved.
