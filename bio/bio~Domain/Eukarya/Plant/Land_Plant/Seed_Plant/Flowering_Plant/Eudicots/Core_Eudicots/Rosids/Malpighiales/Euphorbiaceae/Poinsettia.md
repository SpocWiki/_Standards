> The poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) 
> is a commercially important flowering plant species of the diverse spurge family Euphorbiaceae. 
> 
> Indigenous to Mexico and Central America, the poinsettia was first described by Europeans in 1834. 
> It is particularly well known for its red and green foliage and is widely used in Christmas floral displays. 
> 
> It derives its common English name from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States minister to Mexico, 
> who is credited with introducing the plant to the US in the 1820s. 
> 
> Poinsettias are shrubs or small trees, with heights of 0.6 to 4 m (2.0 to 13.1 ft). 
> Though often stated to be highly toxic, the poinsettia is not dangerous to pets or children. 
> Exposure to the plant, even consumption, most often results in no effect, 
> though it can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
>
> Wild poinsettias occur from Mexico to southern Guatemala, 
> growing on mid-elevation, Pacific-facing slopes. 
> 
> One population in the Mexican state of Guerrero is much further inland, however, 
> and is thought to be the ancestor of most cultivated populations. 
> 
> Wild poinsettia populations are highly fragmented, 
> as their habitat is experiencing largely unregulated deforestation. 
> 
> They were cultivated by the Aztecs for use in traditional medicine. 
> 
> They became associated with the Christmas holiday and are popular seasonal decorations. 
> Every year in the United States, 
> approximately 70 million poinsettias of many cultivated varieties are sold in a six-week period. 
> Many of these poinsettias are grown by Paul Ecke Ranch, 
> which serves half the worldwide market and 70 percent of the US market.
