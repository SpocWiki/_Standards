> **Nelumbo**  is a genus of aquatic plants with large, showy flowers. 
> Members are commonly called lotus, 
> though the name is also applied to various other plants and plant groups, 
> including the unrelated genus Lotus.  
> 
> Members outwardly resemble those in the family Nymphaeaceae ("water lilies"), 
> but Nelumbo is actually very distant from that family.
>
> Nelumbo is an ancient genus, with dozens of species 
> known from fossil remains since the Early Cretaceous. 
> 
> However, there are only two known living species of lotus. 
> One is the better-known Nelumbo nucifera, 
> which is native to East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and probably Australia 
> and is commonly cultivated for consumption and use in traditional Chinese medicine. 
> 
> The other lotus is Nelumbo lutea, which is native to North America and the Caribbean. 
> Horticultural hybrids have been produced between these two allopatric species.
