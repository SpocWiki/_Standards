> **Caryophyllales** ( KARR-ee-oh-fih-LAY-leez) is a diverse and heterogeneous order of flowering plants 
> with well-known members including cacti, carnations, beets, quinoa, spinach, amaranths, 
> pigfaces and ice plants, oraches and saltbushes, goosefoots, sundews, Venus flytraps, 
> monkey cup pitcher plants, Malabar spinach, bougainvilleas, four o'clock flowers, 
> buckwheat, knotweeds, rhubarb, sorrel, portulacas, jojoba, and tamarisks. 
> 
> Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.
>
> The betalain pigments are unique in plants of this order and occur in all its core families 
> with the exception of Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae. 
> 
> Noncore families, such as Nepenthaceae, instead produce anthocyanins. 
> In its modern definition, the order encompasses a whole new group of families 
> (formerly included in the order Polygonales) that never synthesize betalains, 
> among which several families are carnivorous (like Nepenthaceae and Droseraceae).
>
> According to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Caryophyllales 
> split from other plants about 111 million years ago.
