## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Adansonia** is a genus of medium-to-large deciduous trees known as baobab. 
> The eight species of Adansonia are native to Africa, Australia, 
> and Madagascar but have also been introduced to other regions of the world, 
> including Barbados, where several of the baobabs there 
> are suspected to have originated from Africa. 
> Other baobabs have been introduced to Asia. 
> A genomic and ecological analysis further suggests 
> that the genus itself originated from Madagascar.
>
> The generic name Adansonia honours Michel Adanson, 
> the French naturalist and explorer 
> who provided the first detailed botanical description 
> and illustrations of Adansonia digitata. 
> 
> The baobab, however, is also known as the "upside down tree," 
> a name attributable to the trees' overall appearance and historical myths. 
> 
> Baobabs are among the most long-lived of vascular plants 
> and have large flowers that are reproductive for a maximum of 15 hours. 
> The flowers open around dusk with sufficiently rapid movement 
> that is detectable by the naked eye. 
> The fruits are large, oval to round and berry-like, 
> and hold kidney-shaped seeds in a dry, pulpy matrix.
>
> In the early 21st century, baobabs in southern Africa 
> began to die off rapidly and mysteriouslyâ€”the cause is yet to be determined. 
> Blight or pests are unlikely to have caused such rapid death, 
> so some have speculated that the cause may have been mass dehydration.
