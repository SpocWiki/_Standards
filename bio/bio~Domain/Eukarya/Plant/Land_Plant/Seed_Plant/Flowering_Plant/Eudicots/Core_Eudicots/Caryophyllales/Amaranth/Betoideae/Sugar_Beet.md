#has_/time_/started :: 1802-06-01 

In about 1800, this cultivar boasted about 5–6% sucrose by (dry) weight.
It would go on to be the progenitor of all modern sugar beets.
The plant breeding process has continued since then, 
leading to a sucrose content of around 18% in modern varieties

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> A **sugar beet** is a plant whose root contains a high concentration of sucrose 
> and that is grown commercially for sugar production. 
> In plant breeding, it is known as the Altissima cultivar group of the common beet (Beta vulgaris). 
> Together with other beet cultivars, such as beetroot and chard, 
> it belongs to the subspecies Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris but classified as var. saccharifera . 
> Its closest wild relative is the sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima).
>
> Sugar beets are grown in climates that are too cold for sugarcane. 
> In 2020, Russia, the United States, Germany, France and Turkey 
> were the world's five largest sugar beet producers. 
> 
> In 2010–2011, Europe, and North America except Arctic territories 
> failed to supply the overall domestic demand for sugar and were all net importers of sugar. 
> The US harvested 1,004,600 acres (406,547 ha) of sugar beets in 2008. 
> 
> In 2009, sugar beets accounted for 20% of the world's sugar production and nearly 30% by 2013. 
> Sugarcane accounts for most of the rest of sugar produced globally. 
> In February 2015, a USDA factsheet reported 
> that sugar beets generally account for about 55 percent of domestically produced sugar, 
> and sugar cane for about 45 percent.
