> Polygonoideae is a subfamily of plants in the family Polygonaceae. 
> It includes a number of plants that can be highly invasive, such as 
> Japanese knotweed, Reynoutria japonica, and its hybrid with R. sachalinensis, R. × bohemica. 
> 
> The subfamily also includes the cultivated genus Rheum, rhubarb. 
> 
> Boundaries between the genera placed in the subfamily and their relationships have long been problematic, but a series of molecular phylogenetic studies have clarified some of them, resulting in the division of the subfamily into seven tribes.
