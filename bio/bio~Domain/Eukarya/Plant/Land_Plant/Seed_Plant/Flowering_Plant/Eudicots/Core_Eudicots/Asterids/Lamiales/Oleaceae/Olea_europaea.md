> The olive (botanical name Olea europaea, "European olive") 
> is a species of subtropical evergreen tree in the family Oleaceae. 
> 
> Originating in Asia Minor, it is abundant throughout the Mediterranean Basin, 
> with wild subspecies in Africa and western Asia; 
> modern cultivars are traced primarily to the Near East, Aegean Sea, and Strait of Gibraltar. 
> 
> The olive is the type species for its genus, Olea, 
> and lends its name to the Oleaceae plant family, 
> which includes species such as lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and ash. 
> 
> The olive fruit is classed botanically as a drupe, similar to the cherry or peach. The term oil—now used to describe any viscous water-insoluble liquid—was virtually synonymous with olive oil, the liquid fat made from olives. 
>
> The olive has deep historical, economic, and cultural significance in the Mediterranean; 
> Georges Duhamel remarked that the "Mediterranean ends where the **Olive tree** no longer grows". 
> 
> Among the oldest fruit trees domesticated by humans, 
> the olive was first cultivated in the Eastern Mediterranean between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago, 
> most likely in the Levant. 
> 
> It gradually disseminated throughout the Mediterranean via trade and human migration 
> starting in the 16th century BC; the olive took root in Crete around 3500 BC 
> and reached Iberia by about 1050 BC. 
>
> Olive cultivation was vital to the growth and prosperity of various Mediterranean civilizations, 
> from the Minoans and Myceneans of the Bronze Age 
> to the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity.    
>
> The olive has long been prized throughout the Mediterranean for its myriad uses and properties. 
> Aside from its edible fruit, the extracted oil was used for lamp fuel, personal grooming, cosmetics, 
> soap, lubrication, and medicine; its wood was sometimes used for construction. 
> 
> Owing to its utility, resilience, and longevity—which can allegedly reach thousands of years—
> the olive also held symbolic and spiritual importance in various cultures; 
> it was used in religious rituals, funerary processions, and public ceremonies, 
> from the ancient Olympic games to the coronation of Israelite kings. 
> 
> Ancient Greeks regarded the olive tree as sacred and a symbol of peace, prosperity, 
> and wisdom—associations that persist to this day. 
> 
> The olive is a core ingredient in traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, 
> particularly in the form of olive oil, and a defining feature of local landscapes, commerce, and folk traditions. 
>
> The olive is cultivated in all countries of the Mediterranean, 
> as well as in Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, and South Africa. Spain, Italy, 
> and Greece lead the world in commercial olive production; 
> other major producers are Turkey, Tunisia, Syria, Morocco, Algeria, and Portugal. 
> 
> There are thousands of cultivars of the olive tree, which may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both; some varieties are grown as ornamental sterile shrubs, known as Olea europaea Montra, dwarf olive, or little olive. Approximately 80% of all harvested olives are processed into oil, while about 20% are used for consumption, generally referred to as "table olives".
