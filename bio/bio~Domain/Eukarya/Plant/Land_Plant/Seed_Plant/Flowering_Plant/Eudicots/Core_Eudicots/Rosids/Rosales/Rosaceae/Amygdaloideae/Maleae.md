## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Maleae** (incorrectly Pyreae) are the apple tribe in the rose family, Rosaceae. 
> The group includes a number of plants bearing commercially important fruits, 
> such as apples and pears, while others are cultivated as ornamentals. 
> 
> Older taxonomies separated some of this group as tribe Crataegeae, 
> as the Cydonia group (a tentative placement), 
> or some genera were placed in family Quillajaceae.
>
> The tribe consists exclusively of shrubs and small trees. 
> Most have pomes, a type of accessory fruit that does not occur in other Rosaceae. 
> 
> All except Vauquelinia (with 15 chromosomes) 
> have a basal haploid chromosome count of 17, 
> instead of 7, 8, or 9 as in the other Rosaceae.
>
> There are approximately 28 genera that contain about 1100 species worldwide, 
> with most species occurring in the temperate Northern Hemisphere.
