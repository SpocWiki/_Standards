> **Asteraceae** is a large family of flowering plants that consists of over 32,000 known species 
> in over 1,900 genera within the order Asterales. 
> 
> The number of species in Asteraceae is rivaled only by the Orchidaceae, 
> and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of extant species in each family is unknown. 
> 
> The Asteraceae were first described in the year 1740 and given the original name Compositae.  
> The family is commonly known as the aster, daisy, composite, or sunflower family.
>
> Most species of Asteraceae are herbaceous plants, and may be annual, biennial, or perennial, but there are also shrubs, vines, and trees. The family has a widespread distribution, from subpolar to tropical regions, in a wide variety of habitats. Most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi-desert climates, and they are found on every continent but Antarctica. Their common primary  characteristic is compound flower heads, technically known as capitula, consisting of sometimes hundreds of tiny individual florets enclosed by a whorl of protective involucral bracts.
>
> The oldest known fossils are pollen grains from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian to Maastrichtian) of Antarctica, dated to c. 76–66 million years ago (mya). It is estimated that the crown group of Asteraceae evolved at least 85.9 mya (Late Cretaceous, Santonian) with a stem node age of 88–89 mya (Late Cretaceous, Coniacian).
>
> Asteraceae is an economically important family, providing food staples, garden plants, and herbal medicines. Species outside of their native ranges can become weedy or invasive.
