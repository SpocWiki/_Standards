> The **PACMAD** clade (previously PACCMAD, PACCAD, or PACC) is one of two major lineages (or clades) of the true grasses (Poaceae), 
> regrouping six subfamilies and about 5700 species, more than half of all true grasses. 
> Its sister group is the BOP clade. 
> The PACMAD lineage is the only group within the grasses in which the C4 photosynthesis pathway has evolved; 
> studies have shown that this happened independently multiple times.
