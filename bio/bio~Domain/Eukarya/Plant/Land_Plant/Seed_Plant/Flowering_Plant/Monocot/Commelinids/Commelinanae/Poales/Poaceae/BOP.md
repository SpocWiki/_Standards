> The BOP clade (sometimes BEP clade) is one of two major lineages (or clades) 
> of undefined taxonomic rank in the grasses (Poaceae), 
> containing more than 5,400 species, about half of all grasses. 
> 
> Well-known members of this clade include 
> rice, some major cereals such as wheat, barley, oat, and rye, many lawn and pasture grasses, and bamboos. 
> Its sister group is the PACMAD clade; in contrast with many species of that group who have evolved C4 photosynthesis, 
> the BOP grasses all use the C3 photosynthetic pathway.
>
> The clade contains three subfamilies from whose initials its name derives: the bamboos (Bambusoideae); Oryzoideae (syn. Ehrhartoideae), including rice; and Pooideae, mainly distributed in temperate regions, with the largest diversity and important cereal crops such as wheat and barley. Oryzoideae is the earliest-diverging lineage, sister to the bamboos and Pooideae:
