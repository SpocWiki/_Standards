> **Asphodelaceae** is a family of flowering plants in the order Asparagales. 
> Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, 
> but the circumscription has varied widely. 
> 
> In its current circumscription in the APG IV system, 
> it includes about 40 genera and 900 known species. The type genus is Asphodelus.
>
> The family has a wide, but scattered, distribution 
> throughout the tropics and temperate zones; for example, 
> - Xanthorrhoea is endemic to Australia, 
> - while the Aloes are unique to Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. 
> 
> Many of the family's genera are cultivated as ornamentals, 
> with some being highly collectible and sought-after, such as Haworthia and Gasteria, 
> as well as their intergeneric hybrids with Aloe (x Gasteraloe, x Gastorthia, x Haworthaloe, etc.), 
> while a few are grown commercially for cut flowers. 
> 
> Two species of Aloe, A. vera and A. maculata, are grown for their leaf sap, 
> which contains digestive enzymes, and has medicinal and cosmetic applications.
