# [[Cereal]] 

The Name is derived from the roman goddess [[../../../../../../../../../../../Philosophy/Metaphysic/Religion/Mythology/Roman_Mythology/Ceres(Mythology)|Ceres]]. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Cereal** is a grass cultivated for its edible grain. 
> Cereals are the world's largest crops, and are therefore staple foods. 
> They include rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, millet, and maize. 
> 
> Edible grains from other plant families, such as [[../../../../Eudicots/Core_Eudicots/Caryophyllales/Polygonales/Buckwheat|buckwheat]] and [[Cereal/Quinoa|quinoa]], are pseudocereals. 
> Most cereals are annuals, producing one crop from each planting, 
> though rice is sometimes grown as a perennial. 
> 
> Winter varieties are hardy enough to be planted in the autumn, 
> becoming dormant in the winter, and harvested in spring or early summer; 
> spring varieties are planted in spring and harvested in late summer. 
> The term cereal is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of grain crops and fertility, [[../../../../../../../../../../../Astronomy/Solar_System/Asteroid_Belt/Ceres(Asteroid)]].
>
> Cereals were domesticated in the Neolithic, some 8,000 years ago. 
> [[Cereal/Wheat|Wheat]] and [[Cereal/Barley|barley]] were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent; 
> [[Cereal/Rice|rice]] was domesticated in East Asia, and [[Cereal/Sorghum|sorghum]] and [[Cereal/Millet|millet]] were domesticated in West Africa. 
> Maize was domesticated by Indigenous peoples of the Americas in southern Mexico 
> about 9,000 years ago. 
> 
> In the 20th century, cereal productivity was greatly increased by the Green Revolution. 
> This increase in production has accompanied a growing international trade, 
> with some countries producing large portions of the cereal supply for other countries.

>
> Cereals provide food eaten directly as whole grains, usually cooked, 
> or they are ground to flour and made into [[../../../../../../../../../../../Society/Economics/Home_Economics/Cooking/Food/Bread|bread]], porridge, and other products. 
> 
> Cereals have a high [[../../../../../../../../../../Metabolism/Nutrition/Carbohydrate/Polysaccharide/Starch|starch]] content, 
> enabling them to be fermented into alcoholic drinks such as [[../../../../../../../../../../../Society/Economics/Home_Economics/Cooking/Food/Drink/Alcoholic_Beverage/Beer|beer]]. 
> 
> Cereal farming has a substantial environmental impact, 
> and is often produced in high-intensity monocultures. 
> The environmental harms can be mitigated by sustainable practices 
> which reduce the impact on soil and improve biodiversity, 
> such as no-till farming and intercropping.
