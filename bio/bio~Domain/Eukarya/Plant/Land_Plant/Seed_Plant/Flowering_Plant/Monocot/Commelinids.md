> In plant taxonomy, **Commelinids** (originally commelinoids) is a clade of flowering plants within the monocots, distinguished by having cell walls containing ferulic acid. Well-known commelinids include palms and relatives (order Arecales), dayflowers, spiderworts, kangaroo paws, and water hyacinth (order Commelinales), grasses, bromeliads, rushes, and sedges (order Poales), ginger, cardamom, turmeric, galangal, bananas, plantains, and bird of paradise flower (order Zingiberales).

> The commelinids are the only clade that the APG IV system has informally named within the monocots.  The remaining monocots are a paraphyletic unit. Also known as the commelinid monocots it forms one of three groupings within the monocots, and the final branch; the other two groups are the alismatid monocots and the lilioid monocots.
