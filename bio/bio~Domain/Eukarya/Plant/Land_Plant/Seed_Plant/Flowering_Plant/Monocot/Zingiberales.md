## Introduction

[W. John Kress and William J. Hahn]() 

The gingers, bananas, and relatives form a clearly defined linage of monocots 
including 8 families, 88 genera, and approximately 2000 species.

### Characteristics

Morphological synapomorphies for the clade include 
- specialized isomorphic root hair cells, 
- presence of silica bodies in cells, 
- epigynous flowers, 
- pollen grains without distinctive apertures and 
- a reduced exine layer, nuclear endosperm development, and arillate seeds
(Kress, 1990, 1995).
