## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Piperaceae**, also known as the pepper family, are a large family of flowering plants. 
> The group contains roughly 3,600 currently accepted species in five genera. 
> The vast majority of species can be found within the two main genera: 
> - Piper (2,171 species) and 
> - Peperomia (over 1,000 species).
>
> Members of the Piperaceae may be small trees, shrubs, or herbs. 
> The distribution of this group is best described as pantropical.
>
> The best-known species, Piper nigrum, yields most peppercorns that are used as spices, 
> including black pepper, although its relatives in the family include many other spices. 
> 
> The family Piperaceae is unrelated to the family Solanaceae, 
> which includes bell peppers and chili peppers, 
> which are so named due to Europeans taking part in the Columbian exchange 
> mistakenly believing the spicy fruits were a variety of the black pepper plant.
