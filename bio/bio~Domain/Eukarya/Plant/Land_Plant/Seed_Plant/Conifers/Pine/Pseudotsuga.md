## Introduction

[David S. Gernandt]()

*Pseudotsuga* is a small genus of approximately five species distributed
in eastern Asia and western North America. *Pseudotsuga menziesii*, with
a distribution from western Canada to central Mexico, is one of the most
economically important timber species in the world.

### Characteristics

Medium to tall trees with straight stems and upright to spreading
branches. Spirally arranged leaves (needles), reddish brown
ovoid-conical vegetative buds. Reddish brown ovulate cones are pendulous
with exserted bracts (Farjon 1990).

### Discussion of Phylogenetic Relationships

Farjon (1990) recognized only four species of *Pseudotsuga*:
*Pseudotsuga macrocarpa* from southern California, *Pseudotsuga
menziesii* ranging from Canada to south-central Mexico, *Pseudotsuga
japonica* from southern Japan, and *Pseudotsuga sinensis* from China.
Included in the ToL phylogeny is also *P. wilsoniana* from Taiwan. In
addition to *P. wilsoniana*, several other species have been segregated
from *Pseudotsuga sinensis* (*P. forrestii*, *P. salvadorii*, *P.
gaussenii*, *P. brevifolia*, *P. xichangensis*), but these have not been
widely accepted. Mexican botanists tend to recognize four segregate
species of *Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca* in Mexico: *P.
macrolepis*, *P. rehderi*, *P. guinieri*, and *P. flahaultii* (Martínez
1963).

Relationships among the widely-accepted species were studied by Strauss
et al. 1990 using DNA restriction fragments and by Gernandt and Liston
(1999) using nuclear ribosomal DNA.
