# [[Ginkgo]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ginkgo** is a genus of non-flowering seed plants, assigned to the gymnosperms. 
> The scientific name is also used as the English common name. 
> 
> The order to which the genus belongs, Ginkgoales, first appeared in the Permian, 270 million years ago, and Ginkgo is now the only living genus within the order. The rate of evolution within the genus has been slow, and almost all its species had become extinct by the end of the Pliocene. The sole surviving species, Ginkgo biloba, is found in the wild only in China, but is cultivated around the world. The relationships between ginkgos and other groups of plants are not fully resolved.
