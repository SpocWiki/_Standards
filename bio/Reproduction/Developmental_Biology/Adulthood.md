> An adult is an animal that has reached full growth. 
> The biological definition of adult is an organism that has reached sexual maturity 
> and thus capable of reproduction. 
>
> In the human context, the term adult has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. 
> In contrast to a non-adult or "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority 
> and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. 
> They may also be regarded as "majors". 
> The typical age of attaining **Adulthood** for humans is 18 years, although definition may vary by country.
>
> Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. 
> Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; 
> a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior, 
> but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. 
> Conversely, one may legally be an adult 
> but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
>
> In different cultures, there are events that relate 
> passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. 
> This often encompasses passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, 
> or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. 
> 
> Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age 
> without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.
