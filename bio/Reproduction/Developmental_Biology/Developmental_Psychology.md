> Developmental psychology is the scientific study of 
> how and why humans grow, change, and adapt across the course of their lives. 
> 
> Originally concerned with infants and children, 
> the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. 
> 
> Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life. 
> This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are 
> - physical development, 
> - cognitive development, and 
> - social emotional development. 
> 
> Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including 
> - motor skills, 
> - executive functions, 
> - moral understanding, 
> - language acquisition, 
> - social change, 
> - personality, 
> - emotional development, 
> - self-concept, and 
> - identity formation.

> Developmental psychology explores the influence of both nature and nurture on human development, as well as the processes of change that occur across different contexts over time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factors, including the social context and the built environment. Ongoing debates in regards to developmental psychology include biological essentialism vs. neuroplasticity and stages of development vs. dynamic systems of development. While research in developmental psychology has certain limitations, ongoing studies aim to understand how life stage transitions and biological factors influence human behavior and development.
>
> Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as educational psychology, child psychopathology, forensic developmental psychology, child development, cognitive psychology, ecological psychology, and cultural psychology. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include Urie Bronfenbrenner, Erik Erikson, Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, Jean Piaget, Barbara Rogoff, Esther Thelen, and Lev Vygotsky.
