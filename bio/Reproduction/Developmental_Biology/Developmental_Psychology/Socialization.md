## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In sociology, **Socialization** (or socialisation) is the process through which 
> individuals internalize the norms, customs, values and ideologies of their society. 
> 
> It involves both learning and teaching 
> and is the primary means of maintaining social and cultural continuity over time. 
> It is a lifelong process that shapes the behavior, beliefs, and actions 
> of adults as well as of children.
>
> Socialization is closely linked to developmental psychology and behaviorism. 
> Humans need social experiences to learn their culture and to survive.
>
> Socialization may lead to desirable outcomes—sometimes labeled "moral"—
> as regards the society where it occurs. 
> 
> Individual views are influenced by the society's consensus 
> and usually tend toward what that society finds acceptable or "normal. 
> 
> Socialization provides only a partial explanation for human beliefs and behaviors, 
> maintaining that agents are not blank slates predetermined by their environment; 
> scientific research provides evidence that people are shaped by both social influences and genes.
>
> Genetic studies have shown that a person's environment interacts with their genotype 
> to influence behavioral outcomes.
