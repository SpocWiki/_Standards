> Development of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. 
> The process begins with fertilization, 
> where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by a sperm cell from a male. 
> The resulting zygote develops through cell proliferation and differentiation, 
> and the resulting embryo then implants in the uterus, 
> where the embryo continues development through a fetal stage until birth. 
> 
> Further growth and development continues after birth, 
> and includes both physical and psychological development 
> that is influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. 
> 
> This continues throughout life: through [[Childhood|childhood]] and [[Adolescence|adolescence]] into [[Adulthood]].
