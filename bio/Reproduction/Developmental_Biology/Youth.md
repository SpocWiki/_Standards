## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Youth** is the time of life when one is young. 
> The word, youth, can also mean the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity), 
> but it can also refer to one's peak, in terms of health or the period of life known as being a  young adult. 
> 
> Youth is also defined as 
> "the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one, who is young". 
> Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work, or having sexual relations.
>
> Youth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, 
> which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. 
> 
> Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, 
> while a youth's level of dependency means the extent 
> to which they still rely on their family emotionally and economically.
