> While in ordinary speech, the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, 
> in contemporary academic literature, the terms often have distinct meanings, 
> especially when referring to people. 
> 
> Sex generally refers to an organism's assigned biological sex, while gender usually refers to 
> - either social roles typically associated with the sex of a person (gender role) 
> - or personal identification of one's own gender based on their own personal sense of it (gender identity). 
> 
> Most contemporary social scientists, behavioral scientists and biologists, 
> many legal systems and government bodies and intergovernmental agencies such as the WHO 
> make a distinction between gender and sex. 
> In most individuals, the various biological determinants of sex are congruent, 
> and sex is consistent with the individual's gender identity, 
> but in rare circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, 
> and the person may be transgender.
>
> Though sex and gender have been used interchangeably 
> at least as early as the fourteenth century, this usage was not common by the late 1900s.

> Sexologist John Money 
> pioneered the concept of a distinction between biological sex and gender identity in 1955. 
> However, Issac Madison Bentley had already 
> defined gender as the "socialized obverse of sex" a decade earlier, in 1945. 
> As originally conceived by Money, gender and sex are analysed together as a single category including both biological and social elements, 
> but later work by Robert Stoller separated the two, 
> designating sex and gender as biological and cultural categories, respectively. 
> Before the work of Bentley, Money and Stoller, 
> the word gender was only regularly used to refer to grammatical categories.
