## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Fertility** in colloquial terms refers the ability to have offspring. 
> In demographic contexts, fertility refers to the actual production of offspring, 
> rather than the physical capability to reproduce, which is termed [[fecundity]]. 
> 
> The fertility rate is the average number of children born during an individual's lifetime. 
> In medicine, fertility refers to the ability to have children, 
> and infertility refers to difficulty in reproducing naturally. 
> 
> In general, infertility or subfertility in humans is defined as 
> not being able to conceive a child after one year (or longer) of unprotected sex. 
> The antithesis of fertility is infertility, while the antithesis of fecundity is sterility.
