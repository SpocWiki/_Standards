> In botany, a **seed** is a plant structure containing an embryo and stored nutrients 
> in a protective coat called a testa. 
> 
> More generally, the term "seed" means anything that can be sown, 
> which may include seed and husk or tuber. 
> 
> Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, 
> after the embryo sac is fertilized by sperm from pollen, forming a zygote. 
> The embryo within a seed develops from the zygote 
> and grows within the mother plant to a certain size before growth is halted.
>
> The formation of the seed is the defining part of the process of reproduction in seed plants (spermatophytes). 
> Other plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, do not have seeds 
> and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. 
> Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, 
> from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates.
>
> In the flowering plants, the ovary ripens into a fruit which contains the seed 
> and serves to disseminate it. 
> Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry fruits. 
> 
> Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, 
> which must be split open to reach the seed. 
> 
> Different groups of plants have other modifications, 
> the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) 
> fused to and surrounding the actual seed. 
> Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, 
> such as an acorn or hazelnut.
