## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Oral sex, sometimes referred to as oral intercourse, 
> is sexual activity involving the stimulation of the genitalia of a person by another person 
> using the mouth (including the lips, tongue, or teeth). 
> Cunnilingus is oral sex performed on the vulva 
> while fellatio is oral sex performed on the penis. 
> Anilingus, another form of oral sex, is oral stimulation of the anus.
>
> Oral sex may be performed as foreplay to incite sexual arousal 
> before other sexual activities (such as vaginal or anal intercourse), 
> or as an erotic and physically intimate act in its own right. 
> 
> Like most forms of sexual activity, 
> oral sex can pose a risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
> However, the transmission risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, 
> is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex.
>
> Oral sex is often regarded as taboo, 
> but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice. 
> Commonly, people do not think of oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, 
> though opinions on the matter vary. 
> 
> People may also have negative feelings or sexual inhibitions 
> about giving or receiving oral sex, or may flatly refuse to engage in the practice.
