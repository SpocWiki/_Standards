> **Masturbation** is a form of autoeroticism in which a person sexually stimulates their own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually to the point of orgasm. Stimulation may involve the use of hands, everyday objects, sex toys, or more rarely, the mouth (autofellatio and autocunnilingus). Masturbation may also be performed with a sex partner, either masturbating together or watching the other partner masturbate, known as "mutual masturbation".
>
> Masturbation is frequent in both sexes. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder has been found. Masturbation is considered by clinicians to be a healthy, normal part of sexual enjoyment.  The only exceptions to "masturbation causes no harm" are certain cases of Peyronie's disease and hard flaccid syndrome.
>
> Masturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times, and is both mentioned and discussed in very early writings. Religions vary in their views of masturbation. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it in negative terms, but during the 20th century, these taboos generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history, and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries. Masturbation in non-human animals has been observed both in the wild and captivity.
