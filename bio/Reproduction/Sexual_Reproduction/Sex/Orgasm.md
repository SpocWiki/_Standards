## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Orgasm** (from Greek ὀργασμός, orgasmos; "excitement, swelling"), sexual climax, or simply climax, 
> is the sudden release of accumulated sexual excitement during the sexual response cycle, 
> characterized by intense sexual pleasure 
> resulting in rhythmic, involuntary muscular contractions in the pelvic region. 
> 
> Orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or autonomic nervous system 
> and are experienced by both males and females; 
> the body's response includes muscular spasms (in multiple areas), a general euphoric sensation, 
> and, frequently, body movements and vocalizations. 
> 
> The period after orgasm (known as the resolution phase) is typically a relaxing experience 
> due to the release of the neurohormones oxytocin and prolactin, 
> as well as endorphins (or "endogenous morphine").
>
> Human orgasms usually result from physical sexual stimulation 
> of the penis in males (typically accompanied by ejaculation) and of the clitoris (and vagina) in females. 
> 
> Sexual stimulation can be by masturbation or with a sexual partner 
> (penetrative sex, non-penetrative sex, or other sexual activity). 
> Physical stimulation is not a requisite, as it is possible to reach orgasm through psychological means. 
> Getting to orgasm may be difficult without a suitable psychological state. 
> During sleep, a sex dream can trigger an orgasm and the release of sexual fluids (nocturnal emission).
>
> The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. 
> There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state, 
> as well as changes in the central nervous system, 
> such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex, 
> while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., "bordering") areas of the brain. 
> There are sexual dysfunctions involving orgasm, such as anorgasmia.
>
> The importance of reaching orgasm for sex to be satisfying varies between individuals, 
> and theories about the biological and evolutionary functions of orgasm differ.
