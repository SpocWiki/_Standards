> Sexual attraction is attraction on the basis of sexual desire 
> or the quality of arousing such interest. 
> 
> Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract other people sexually, 
> and is a factor in sexual selection or mate choice. 
> 
> The attraction can be to the physical or other qualities or traits of a person, 
> or to such qualities in the context where they appear. 
> 
> The attraction may be to a person's aesthetics, movements, voice, among other things. 
> The attraction may be enhanced by a person's body odor, sex pheromones, 
> adornments, clothing, perfume or hair style. 
> 
> It can be influenced by individual genetic, psychological, or cultural factors, 
> or to other, more amorphous qualities. 
> 
> Sexual attraction is also a response to another person 
> that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits 
> and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.
>
> Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness 
> and measure it as one of several bodily forms of capital asset (e.g. erotic capital), 
> a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and sexual orientation. For example, a gay or lesbian person would typically find a person of the same sex to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A bisexual person would find either sex to be attractive. Asexuality refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction or a non-directed libido. Interpersonal attraction includes factors such as physical or psychological similarity, familiarity or possessing a preponderance of common or familiar features, similarity, complementarity, reciprocal liking, and reinforcement.

> The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in advertising, film, and other visual media, as well as in modeling and other occupations. In evolutionary terms, the ovulatory shift hypothesis posits that female humans exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their menstrual cycle, as a means to ensure that they attract a high quality mate to copulate with during their most fertile time. Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in an attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to ovulation.
