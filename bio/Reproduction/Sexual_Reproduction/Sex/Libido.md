> The **Libido** ( lih-BEE-doh; from Latin  libīdō) refers to a psychological energy 
> that, in common parlance, encompasses all forms of sexual desire, 
> but is sometimes also regarded as the driving force behind other needs, 
> such as a mother's love for her infant. 
> 
> The term was originally developed by Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis. 
> Initially it referred only to specific sexual needs, 
> but he later expanded the concept to a universal desire, 
> with the id being its "great reservoir". 
> 
> As driving energy behind all life processes, libido became the source of 
> - the social engagement (maternal love instinct, for example), 
> - sexual behaviour, 
> - pursuit for nutrition, 
> - skin pleasure, 
> - knowledge and 
> - victory in all areas of self- and species preservation. 
>
> Equated the libido with the Eros of Platonic philosophy, 
> Freud further differentiated two inherent operators: the life drive and the death drive. 
> Both aspects are working complementary to each other: 
> While the death drive, also called Destrudo or Thanatos, 
> embodies the principle of 'analytical' decomposition of complex phenomenon, 
> the effect of life drive (Greek Bios) is to reassemble or 
> synthesise the parts of the decomposition in a way 
> that serves the organisms regeneration and reproduction. 
> 
> Freud's most abstract description of libido represents an energetic potential 
> that begins like a bow to tense up unpleasantly (noticeable 'hunger') 
> in order to pleasantly relax again (noticeable satisfaction); 
> its nature is both physical and psychological. 
> 
> Starting from the id in the fertilised egg, libido initiates also the emergence of two further instances: the ego (function of conscious perception), and the superego, which specialises in retrievable storage of experiences (long-term memory). Together with libido as their source, these three instances represent the common core of all branches of psychoanalysis.
>
> From a neurobiological point of view, 
> the inner perception and regulation of the various innate needs 
> are mediated through the nucleus accumbens by neurotransmitters and hormones; 
> in relation to sexuality, these are mainly testosterone, oestrogen and dopamine. 
> 
> Each of the needs can be influenced by the others 
> (e.g. baby feeding is inextricably connected with sociality); 
> but above all, their fulfilment requires the libidinal satisfaction of curiosity. 
> Without this 'research instinct' of mind, the control of bodily motoric would be impossible, 
> the arrow from the bow called life  wouldn't do its work (death). 
> 
> Just as happiness is anchored in the fulfilment of all innate needs, 
> disturbances through social stress resulting from lifestyle, 
> traumatisation in early childhood or during war, mental and bodily illness 
> lead to suffering that is inwardly noticeable and conscious to the ego. 
> 
> Through the capacity of empathy, 
> linguistic and facial expressions of emotion ultimately also affect the human environment.
