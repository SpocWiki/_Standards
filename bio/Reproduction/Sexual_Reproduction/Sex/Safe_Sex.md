## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Safe sex is sexual activity using protective methods or contraceptive devices 
> (such as condoms) to reduce the risk of transmitting or acquiring 
> sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially HIV. 
> 
> The terms safer sex and protected sex are sometimes preferred, 
> to indicate that even highly effective prevention practices 
> do not completely eliminate all possible risks. 
> 
> It is also sometimes used colloquially to describe methods aimed at 
> preventing pregnancy that may or may not also lower STI risks.
>
> The concept of safe sex emerged in the 1980s as a response to the global AIDS epidemic, 
> and possibly more specifically to the AIDS crisis in the United States. 
> 
> Promoting safe sex is now one of the main aims of sex education and STI prevention, 
> especially reducing new HIV infections. 
> 
> Safe sex is regarded as a harm reduction strategy aimed at reducing the risk of STI transmission.
>
> Although some safe sex practices (like condoms) 
> can also be used as birth control (contraception), 
> most forms of contraception do not protect against STIs. 
> 
> Likewise, some safe sex practices, such as partner selection and low-risk sex behavior, 
> might not be effective forms of contraception.
