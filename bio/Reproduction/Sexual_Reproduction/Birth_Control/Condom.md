> A **Condom** is a sheath-shaped barrier device used during sexual intercourse 
> to reduce the probability of pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). 
> There are both external condoms, also called male condoms, and internal (female) condoms.
>
> The external condom is rolled onto an erect penis before intercourse 
> and works by forming a physical barrier which limits skin-to-skin contact, 
> exposure to fluids, and blocks semen from entering the body of a sexual partner. 
> 
> External condoms are typically made from latex 
> and, less commonly, from polyurethane, polyisoprene, or lamb intestine. 
> 
> External condoms have the advantages of ease of use, ease of access, and few side effects. 
> Individuals with latex allergy should use condoms made from a material other than latex, 
> such as polyurethane. 
> Internal condoms are typically made from polyurethane and may be used multiple times.
>
> With proper use—and use at every act of intercourse—
> women whose partners use external condoms experience a 2% per-year pregnancy rate. 
> With typical use, the rate of pregnancy is 18% per-year. 
> 
> Their use greatly decreases the risk of gonorrhea, 
> chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS. 
> To a lesser extent, they also protect against genital herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis.
>
> Condoms as a method of preventing STIs have been used since at least 1564. 
> Rubber condoms became available in 1855, followed by latex condoms in the 1920s. 
> It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. 
> 
> As of 2019, globally around 21% of those using birth control use the condom, 
> making it the second-most common method after female sterilization (24%). 
> Rates of condom use are highest in East and Southeast Asia, Europe and North America.
