## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In biology, **Moulting** (British English), or molting (American English), 
> also known as sloughing, shedding, or in many invertebrates, ecdysis, 
> is a process by which an animal casts off parts of its body to serve some beneficial purpose, 
> either at specific times of the year, or at specific points in its life cycle.
>
> In medieval times, it was also known as "mewing" (from the French verb "muer", to moult), a term that lives on in the name of Britain's Royal Mews where the King's hawks used to be kept during moulting time before becoming horse stables after Tudor times.
>
> Moulting can involve shedding the epidermis (skin), pelage (hair, feathers, fur, wool), or other external layer. In some groups, other body parts may be shed, for example, the entire exoskeleton in arthropods, including the wings in some insects.
