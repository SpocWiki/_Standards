## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In biology, the **Imago** (Latin for "image") is the last stage an insect attains 
> during its [[WD~Metamorphosis,33753]] , its process of growth and development; 
> it is also called the imaginal stage ("imaginal" being "imago" in adjective form), 
> the stage in which the insect attains maturity. 
> It follows the final ecdysis of the immature instars.
>
> In a member of the Ametabola or Hemimetabola, 
> species in which metamorphosis is "incomplete", 
> the final ecdysis follows the last immature or nymphal stage. 
> In members of the Holometabola, in which there is a pupal stage, 
> the final ecdysis follows emergence from the pupa, 
> after which the metamorphosis is complete, 
> although there is a prolonged period of maturation in some species.
>
> The imago is the only stage during which the insect is sexually mature 
> and, if it is a winged species, the only stage that has functional wings. 
> The imago often is referred to as the adult stage.
>
> Members of the order Ephemeroptera (mayflies) do not have a pupal stage, but they briefly pass through an intermediate winged stage called the subimago. Insects at this stage have functional wings but are not yet sexually mature. 
>
> The Latin plural of imago is imagines, and this is the term generally used by entomologists when a plural form is required –however, imagoes is also acceptable.
