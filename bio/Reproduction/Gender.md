> **Gender** is the range of social, psychological, cultural, and behavioral aspects 
> of being a man (or boy), woman (or girl), or third gender. 
> 
> Although gender often corresponds to sex, 
> a transgender person may identify with a gender other than their sex assigned at birth. 
> Most cultures use a gender binary, in which gender is divided into two categories, 
> and people are considered part of one or the other; 
> those who are outside these groups may fall under the umbrella term non-binary. 
> Some societies have third genders (and fourth genders, etc.) 
> such as the hijras of South Asia and two-spirit persons native to North America. 
> Most scholars agree that gender is a central characteristic for social organization; 
> this may include social constructs (i.e. gender roles) as well as gender expression.
>
> The word has been used as a synonym for sex, 
> and the balance between these usages has shifted over time. 
> In the mid-20th century, a terminological distinction in modern English 
> (known as the sex and gender distinction) between biological sex and gender 
> began to develop in the academic areas of psychology, sociology, sexology, and feminism. 
> 
> Before the mid-20th century, 
> it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. 
> In the West, in the 1970s, feminist theory embraced the concept of a 
> distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. 
> 
> The distinction between gender and sex is made by 
> most contemporary social scientists in Western countries, behavioral scientists and biologists, 
> many legal systems and government bodies, and intergovernmental agencies such as the WHO. 
> 
> The experiences of intersex people also testify to the complexity of sex and gender; 
> female,  male, and other gender identities are experienced across the many divergences of sexual difference.
>
> The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. 
> Other sciences, such as psychology, sociology, sexology, and neuroscience, are interested in the subject. 
> The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, 
> and gender studies particularly does, while research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in females and males influence the development of gender in humans; both inform the debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity and gendered behavior. Biopsychosocial approaches to gender include biological, psychological, and social/cultural aspects.
