> In biology, a **Spore** is a unit of sexual (in fungi) or asexual reproduction 
> that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival, in unfavourable conditions, 
> often for extended periods of time. 
> 
> Spores form part of the life cycles of many plants, algae, fungi and protozoa. 
> They were thought to have appeared as early as the mid-late Ordovician period 
> as an adaptation of early land plants.
>
> Bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle, 
> but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. 
> Myxozoan spores release amoeboid infectious germs ("amoebulae") 
> into their hosts for parasitic infection, 
> but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, 
> which develops from the amoebula.
>
> In plants, spores are usually haploid and unicellular 
> and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte. 
> In some rare cases, a diploid spore is also produced in some algae, or fungi. 
> Under favourable conditions, the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division, 
> producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes. 
> Two gametes fuse to form a zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte. 
> This cycle is known as alternation of generations.
>
> The spores of seed plants are produced internally, and the megaspores (formed within the ovules) 
> and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures 
> that form the dispersal units, the seeds and pollen grains.
