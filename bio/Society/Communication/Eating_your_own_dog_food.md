> Eating your own dog food or "dogfooding" is the 
> practice of using one's own products or services. 
> 
> This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage 
> using product management techniques. 
> 
> Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising. 
> Once in the market, dogfooding can demonstrate developers' confidence in their own products.
