> A team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport 
> requires the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, 
> and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. 
> 
> In **Team sports**, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function 
> and achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar bob in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members while competing against opposing teams to achieve a common goal. Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.
