> The Games have grown to the point that nearly every nation is now represented;

> The Olympic Games have become a significant global event,

## History 

Modern Olympic Games started after Greece achieved Independence from the [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~2~Holocene/Age~3~Meghalayan/Middle_Ages/1300-Late_Middle-Ages/1300-Ottoman_Empire]]. 
They were sponsored by 
Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [Greek War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence "Greek War of Independence") from the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") in 1821. 
[Evangelos Zappas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos_Zappas "Evangelos Zappas"), a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to [King Otto of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Otto_of_Greece "King Otto of Greece"), in 1856, 
offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games.â€Š
Zappas sponsored the first [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappas_Olympics "Zappas Olympics") in 1859, which was held in an [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") city square. 
Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. 
Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [Panathenaic Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaic_Stadium "Panathenaic Stadium") so that it could host all future Olympic Games.

Initially only Summer Games(S) were held.
