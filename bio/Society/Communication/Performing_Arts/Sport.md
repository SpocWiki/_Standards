## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Sport** is a form of physical activity or game. 
> Often competitive & organized, sports use, maintain, or improve __physical ability and skills__. 
> They also provide enjoyment to participants 
> and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 
> Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, 
> some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. 
> 
> Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. 
> Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; 
> others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. 
> A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. 
> Many sports leagues make an annual champion 
> by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
>
> Sport is generally recognised as system of activities 
> based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, 
> with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition. 
> 
> Some organisations, such as the Council of Europe, 
> preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports. 
> However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities 
> claim recognition as mind sports. 
> 
> The International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic Games 
> recognises both chess and bridge as sports. 
> SportAccord, the international sports federation association, 
> recognises five non-physical sports: chess, bridge, draughts, Go and xiangqi. 
> 
> However, they limit the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. 
> Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, 
> which serve to ensure fair competition. 
> Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 
> It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, 
> including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
>
> Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, 
> this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. 
> 
> Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, 
> with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, 
> and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. 
> Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in others integral to the sport.
>
> According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, 
> the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. 
> 
> The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, 
> while [[Sport/Team_Sport/Football/Association_Football]] is the most popular spectator sport.
