## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A fictional universe, also known as an imagined universe or a constructed universe, 
> is the internally consistent fictional setting used in a narrative or a work of art. 
> This concept is most commonly associated with works of fantasy and science fiction, 
> and can be found in various forms such as novels, comics, films, television shows, video games, 
> and other creative works.
>
> In science fiction, a fictional universe may be a remote alien planet 
> or galaxy with little apparent relationship to the real world (as in Star Wars); 
> in fantasy, it may be a greatly fictionalized or invented version of Earth's distant past or future 
> (as in The Lord of the Rings).
