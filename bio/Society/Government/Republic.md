Most modern democracies are also republics. 
They blend the principles of democracy (elections and majority rule) 
with those of a republic (constitutional protections for individual rights).

In summary, while both terms relate to systems where power ultimately resides with the people, 
- "democracy" focuses on how decisions are made (through direct or representative participation), and 
- "republic" focuses on the structures and legal frameworks that guide how power is exercised and limited. 


A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" 
(from the Latin _res publica_ ), and is not the private concern or property of the rulers. 
This includes that any decision can be questioned by the Public. 
The head of state is usually an elected or appointed president, not a monarch.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Republic**, based on the Latin phrase res publica ('public affair'), 
> is a state in which political power rests with the public through their  representatives—
> in contrast to a [[Monarchy]] or [[Aristocracy]] .
>
> Representation in a republic may or may not be freely elected by the general citizenry. 
> In many historical republics, representation has been based on personal status 
> and the role of elections has been limited. This remains true today; 
> among the 159 states that use the word republic in their official names as of 2017, 
> are states that narrowly constrain both the right of representation and the process of election.
>
> The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, 
> lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. 
> This constitution was characterized by 
> - a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; 
> - several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates from the populace and pass laws; and a 
> - series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority.
>
> Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, 
> but there are also subnational state entities that are referred to as republics, 
> or that have governments that are described as republican in nature.
