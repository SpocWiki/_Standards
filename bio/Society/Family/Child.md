## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Child** (pl. children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, 
> or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty. 
> 
> The term may also refer to an unborn human being. 
> In English-speaking countries, the legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, 
> in this case as a person younger than the local age of majority (there are exceptions like, 
> for example, the consume and purchase of alcoholic beverage even after said age of majority), 
> regardless of their physical, mental and sexual development as biological adults. 
> Children generally have fewer rights and responsibilities than adults. 
> They are generally classed as unable to make serious decisions. 
>
> Child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age) 
> or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; 
> it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, 
> or circumstance, as in "a child of nature" or "a child of the Sixties."
