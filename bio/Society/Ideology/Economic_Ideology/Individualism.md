> **Individualism** is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, and social outlook 
> that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual. 
> 
> Individualists promote realizing one's goals and desires, 
> valuing independence and self-reliance, and advocating that 
> the interests of the individual should gain precedence over the state or a social group, 
> while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society 
> or institutions such as the government. 
> Individualism makes the individual its focus, and so 
> starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance 
> in the struggle for liberation". 
>
> Individualism represents one kind of sociocultural perspective 
> and is often defined in contrast to other perspectives, such as 
> [[../../../../../Knowledge/Sociology/Politics/isms/Communitarianism|Communitarianism]], [[collectivism]] and [[corporatism]].
>
> Individualism is also associated with artistic and bohemian interests and lifestyles, 
> where there is a tendency towards self-creation and experimentation 
> as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors, 
> and it is associated with humanist philosophical positions and ethics. 
> 
> "Individualism" has also been used as a term 
> denoting "the quality of being an individual; individuality", 
> related to possessing "an individual characteristic; a quirk".
