## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Capitalism** is an economic system based on the 
> private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. 
> 
> Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, 
> competitive markets, price systems, private property, property rights recognition, 
> economic freedom, profit motive, entrepreneurship, commodification, 
> voluntary exchange, wage labor and the production of commodities. 
> 
> In a market economy, decision-making and investments 
> are determined by owners of wealth, property, or ability to 
> maneuver capital or production ability in __capital and financial markets__—
> whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly 
> determined by __competition in goods and services markets__.
>
> Economists, historians, political economists, and sociologists 
> have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism 
> and have recognized various forms of it in practice. 
> 
> These include laissez-faire or free-market capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, 
> state capitalism, and welfare capitalism. 
> Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, 
> public ownership, obstacles to free competition, 
> and state-sanctioned social policies. 
> 
> The degree of competition in markets and the role of intervention and regulation, 
> as well as the scope of state ownership, vary across different models of capitalism. 
> The extent to which different markets are free 
> and the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy. 
> Most of the existing capitalist economies are mixed economies 
> that combine elements of free markets with state intervention 
> and in some cases economic planning.
>
> Capitalism in its modern form emerged from agrarianism in England, 
> as well as mercantilist practices by European countries 
> between the 16th and 18th centuries. 
> 
> The [[../History/Industrial_Revolution]] of the 18th century 
> established capitalism as a dominant mode of production
> , characterized by factory work and a complex division of labor. 
> 
> Through the process of globalization, 
> capitalism spread across the world in the 19th and 20th centuries, 
> especially before World War I and after the end of the Cold War. 
> During the 19th century, capitalism was largely unregulated by the state, but became more regulated in the post–World War II period through Keynesianism, followed by a return of more unregulated capitalism starting in the 1980s through neoliberalism.
>
> Market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times, places, and cultures. Modern industrial capitalist societies developed in Western Europe in a process that led to the Industrial Revolution. Capitalist economies promote economic growth through accumulation of capital, however a business cycle of economic growth followed by recession is a common characteristic of such economies.
