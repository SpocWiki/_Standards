## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Education** is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. 
> 
> Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. 
> 
> Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, 
> while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. 
> 
> Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. 
> 
> Other classifications focus on teaching methods,
>  such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, 
>  and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. 
>  
>  Additionally, the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals 
>  and the academic field studying educational phenomena.
>
> The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements. International organizations, such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
>
> Many factors influence the success of education. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often associated with discrimination. Other factors encompass access to educational technology, teacher quality, and parental involvement.
>
> The primary academic field examining education is known as education studies. It delves into the nature of education, its objectives, impacts, and methods for enhancement. Education studies encompasses various subfields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. Additionally, it explores topics such as comparative education, pedagogy, and the history of education.
>
> In prehistory, education primarily occurred informally through oral communication and imitation. With the emergence of ancient civilizations, the invention of writing led to an expansion of knowledge, prompting a transition from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was largely accessible to elites and religious groups. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century facilitated widespread access to books, thus increasing general literacy. In the 18th and 19th centuries, public education gained significance, paving the way for the global movement to provide primary education to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. Presently, over 90% of primary-school-age children worldwide attend primary school.
