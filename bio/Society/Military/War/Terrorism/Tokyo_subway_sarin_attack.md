> The Tokyo subway sarin attack (Japanese: 地下鉄サリン事件, Hepburn: Chikatetsu sarin jiken; lit. 'subway sarin incident') 
> was a chemical domestic terrorist attack perpetrated on 20 March 1995, in Tokyo, Japan, 
> by members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult. 
> 
> In five coordinated attacks, the perpetrators released sarin on three lines of the Tokyo Metro 
> (then Teito Rapid Transit Authority) during rush hour, killing 13 people, 
> severely injuring 50 (some of whom later died), and causing temporary vision problems for nearly 1,000 others. 
> The attack was directed against trains passing through Kasumigaseki and Nagatachō, 
> where the National Diet (Japanese parliament) is headquartered in Tokyo.
>
> The group, led by Shoko Asahara, had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, 
> including the Matsumoto sarin attack nine months earlier. 
> They had also produced several other nerve agents, including VX, attempted to produce botulinum toxin 
> and had perpetrated several failed acts of bioterrorism. 
> Asahara had been made aware of a police raid scheduled for 22 March 
> and had planned the Tokyo subway attack in order to hinder police investigations into the cult 
> and perhaps spark the apocalypse the leader of the group had prophesied.
>
> In the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. 
> Police activity continued throughout the summer, and over 200 members were arrested, including Asahara. 
> Thirteen of the senior Aum management, including Asahara himself, were sentenced to death and later executed; 
> many others were given prison sentences up to life. 
> The attack remains the deadliest terrorist incident in Japan as defined by modern standards.
