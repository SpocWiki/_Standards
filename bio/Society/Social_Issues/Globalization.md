## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Globalization** is the process of interaction 
> and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide. 
> 
> The term globalization first appeared in the early 20th century 
> (supplanting an earlier French term mondialisation), 
> developed its current meaning sometime in the second half of the 20th century, 
> and came into popular use in the 1990s to describe the 
> unprecedented international connectivity of the postâ€“Cold War world. 
> 
> Its origins can be traced back to 18th and 19th centuries 
> due to advances in transportation and communications technology. 
> 
> This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade 
> and the exchange of ideas, beliefs, and culture. 
> Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration 
> that is associated with social and cultural aspects. 
> However, disputes and international diplomacy are also 
> large parts of the history of globalization, and of modern globalization.
>
> Economically, globalization involves goods, services, data, technology, 
> and the economic resources of [[Capital]]. 
> 
> The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds. Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible. Advances in transportation, like the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships, and developments in telecommunication infrastructure such as the telegraph, the Internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe.
>
> Though many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history to long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World, and some even to the third millennium BCE. Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s, and in the late 19th century and early 20th century drove a rapid expansion in the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures. The term global city was subsequently popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her work The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo (1991).
>
> In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, migration and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, sociocultural resources, and the natural environment. Academic literature commonly divides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization.
>
> Proponents of globalization point to economic growth and broader societal development as benefits, while opponents claim globalizing processes are detrimental to social well-being due to ethnocentrism, environmental consequences, and other potential drawbacks.
