## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> **Human rights** are universally recognized moral principles or norms 
> that establish standards of human behavior 
> and are often protected by both national and international laws. 
> 
> These rights are considered inherent and inalienable, meaning 
> they belong to every individual simply by virtue of being human, 
> regardless of characteristics like nationality, ethnicity, religion, or socio-economic status. 
> 
> They encompass a broad range of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, 
> such as the right to life, freedom of expression, protection against enslavement, and right to education.
>
> They are applicable everywhere and at all  times in the sense of being universal, 
> and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. 
> They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law, 
> and imposing an obligation on individuals to respect the human rights of others; 
> it is generally considered that they should not be taken away 
> except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances.
>
> The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law 
> and global and regional institutions. 
> 
> The precise meaning of the term right is controversial 
> and remains the subject of ongoing philosophical debate. 
> While there is consensus that human rights encompass a wide variety of rights, 
> such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, 
> free speech, and the right to education, 
> there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included 
> within the general framework of human rights. 
> 
> Some thinkers suggest that human rights should serve as a minimum requirement 
> to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard.
>
> The modern concept of human rights gained significant prominence after World War II, 
> particularly in response to the atrocities of the Holocaust, 
> leading to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 
> by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. 
> 
> This document outlined a comprehensive framework of rights that countries are encouraged 
> to protect, setting a global standard for human dignity, freedom, and justice. 
> The UDHR has since inspired numerous international treaties 
> and national laws designed to promote and safeguard these rights globally.
>
> Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement 
> developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust, 
> culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris 
> by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. 
> 
> Ancient peoples did not share the modern-day conception of universal human rights. 
> 
> The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights, 
> which first appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition 
> and developed in new directions during the European Enlightenment 
> with philosophers such as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson, and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui. 
> 
> This concept featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution 
> and the French Revolution. 
> From this foundation, modern human rights arguments 
> emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, 
> possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide, and war crimes.
>
> While the principle of universal human rights is widely accepted, debates persist 
> regarding which rights should take precedence, how they should be implemented, 
> and their applicability in different cultural contexts. 
> 
> Criticisms often arise from perspectives like cultural relativism, 
> which argue that individual human rights are inappropriate for 
> societies that prioritise a communal or collectivist identity, 
> and may conflict with certain cultural or traditional practices.
>
> Nonetheless, human rights remain a central focus in international relations 
> and legal frameworks, supported by institutions such as the United Nations, 
> various non-governmental organizations, 
> and national bodies dedicated to monitoring and enforcing human rights standards worldwide.
