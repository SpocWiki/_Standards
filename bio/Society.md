Pre-historic human Societies were hunters and gatherers, 
usually living in Clans or larger Families. 
Smaller Structures like the Core Family were not robust enough to survive. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Society** is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction 
> or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, 
> typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. 
> 
> Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals 
> who share a distinctive culture and institutions; 
> a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent members.
>
> Human social structures are complex and highly cooperative, 
> featuring the specialization of labor via social roles. 
> 
> Societies construct roles and other patterns of behavior 
> by deeming certain actions or concepts acceptable or unacceptableâ€”
> these expectations around behavior within a given society are known as societal norms. 
> 
> So far as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members 
> to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis.
>
> Societies vary based on level of technology and type of economic activity. 
> Larger societies with larger food surpluses often exhibit stratification or dominance patterns.  
> 
> Societies can have many different forms of government, 
> various ways of understanding kinship, and different gender roles. 
> 
> Human behavior varies immensely between different societies; 
> humans shape society, but society in turn shapes human beings.
