> **Reproduction** (or procreation or breeding) is the biological process 
> by which new individual organisms – "offspring" – are produced from their "parent" or parents. 
> There are two forms of reproduction: asexual and sexual.
>
> In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. 
> Asexual reproduction is not limited to single-celled organisms. 
> The cloning of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. 
> By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. 
> The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle for biologists. 
> The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce 
> and organisms only pass on 50% of their genes.
>
> Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized reproductive cells, 
> called gametes, which contain half the number of chromosomes of normal cells 
> and are created by meiosis, 
> with typically a male fertilizing a female of the same species to create a fertilized zygote. 
> This produces offspring organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived 
> from those of the two parental organisms.
