## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Tobacco** is the common name of several plants in the genus Nicotiana of the family Solanaceae, 
> and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is N. tabacum. The more potent variant N. rustica is also used in some countries.
>
> Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus.
>
> Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world's single greatest preventable cause of death.
