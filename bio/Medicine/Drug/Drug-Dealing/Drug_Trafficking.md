## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The illegal drug trade, drug trafficking, or narcotrafficking is a global black market 
> dedicated to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale of prohibited drugs. 
> 
> Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except under license, of many types of drugs 
> through the use of drug prohibition laws. 
> 
> The think tank Global Financial Integrity's Transnational Crime and the Developing World report 
> estimates the size of the global illicit drug market between US$426 and US$652 billion in 2014. 
> 
> With a world GDP of US$78 trillion in the same year, 
> the illegal drug trade may be estimated as nearly 1% of total global trade. 
> 
> Consumption of illegal drugs is widespread globally, 
> and it remains very difficult for local authorities to reduce the rates of drug consumption.
