## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Opium** (also known as poppy tears, or Lachryma papaveris) 
> is the dried latex obtained from the seed capsules of the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. 
> 
> Approximately 12 percent of opium is made up of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, 
> which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use 
> and for the illegal drug trade. 
> 
> Opium's main psychoactive alkaloids, primarily morphine, 
> act on μ-opioid receptors, causing analgesia and addiction 
> with long-term use leading to tolerance, dependence, and increased cancer risk. 
> 
> The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, 
> and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. 
> The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is 
> to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; 
> the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated.
>
> The English word for opium is borrowed from Latin, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek: 
> ὄπιον (ópion), a diminutive of ὀπός (opós, "juice of a plant"). 
> 
> The word meconium (derived from the Greek for "opium-like", 
> but now used to refer to newborn stools) historically referred to related, 
> weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppy. 
> 
> The Mediterranean region holds the earliest archaeological 
> evidence of human use of opium poppies dating back to over 5000 BCE, 
> with cultivation beginning around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia. 
> 
> Opium was widely used for food, medicine, ritual, 
> and as a painkiller throughout ancient civilizations including 
> Greece, Egypt, and Islamic societies up to medieval times.
>
> The production methods have not significantly changed since ancient times. 
> Through selective breeding of the Papaver somniferum plant, 
> the content of the phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine, 
> and to a lesser extent thebaine has been greatly increased. 
> 
> In modern times, much of the thebaine, 
> which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for oxycodone, 
> hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and other semisynthetic opiates, 
> originates from extracting Papaver orientale or Papaver bracteatum. 
> 
> Modern opium production, once widely prohibited, now involves large-scale cultivation—
> especially in Afghanistan—where it is harvested by scoring poppy pods 
> to collect latex used for both illicit drugs and legal medicines, 
> with recent Taliban-led reductions drastically cutting cultivation in Afghanistan by over 95%.
>
> For the illegal drug trade, the morphine is extracted from the opium latex, 
> reducing the bulk weight by 88%. 
> It is then converted to heroin which is almost twice as potent, 
> and increases the value by a similar factor. 
> The reduced weight and bulk make it easier to smuggle.
