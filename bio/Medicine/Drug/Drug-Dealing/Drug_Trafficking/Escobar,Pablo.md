> Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (Spanish: [ˈpaβlo eskoˈβaɾ]; 1 December 1949 – 2 December 1993) 
> was a Colombian drug lord, narcoterrorist, and politician 
> who was the founder and leader of the Medellín Cartel. 
> 
> Dubbed the "King of Cocaine", Escobar was one of the wealthiest conventional criminals in history, 
> having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by his death,
> while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the US in the 1980s and early 1990s.
>
> Born in Rionegro and raised in Medellín, 
> Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellín 
> but left without graduating; 
> he instead began engaging in criminality, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, 
> as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. 
> 
> In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, 
> often kidnapping and holding people for ransom. 
> In 1976, Escobar founded the Medellín Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, 
> and established the first smuggling routes from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, 
> through Colombia and eventually into the United States.
>
> Escobar's infiltration into the US created exponential demand for cocaine 
> and by the 1980s it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons into the US from Colombia. 
> 
> He quickly became one of the richest people in the world, 
> but constantly battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, 
> leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians.
>
> In the 1982 Colombian parliamentary election, Escobar was elected 
> as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Party. 
> 
> Through this, he was responsible for community projects 
> such as the construction of houses and football pitches, 
> which gained him popularity among the locals of towns he frequented; 
> however, Escobar's political ambitions were thwarted by the Colombian and US governments, 
> who routinely pushed for his arrest, 
> with Escobar believed to have orchestrated 
> the Avianca Flight 203 and DAS Building bombings in retaliation. 
> 
> In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, 
> and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, 
> but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian president César Gaviria, 
> with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral. 
> 
> In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding 
> when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, 
> leading to a nationwide manhunt. 
> 
> As a result, the Medellín Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, 
> Escobar was killed in his hometown by the Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday.
>
> Escobar's legacy remains controversial; 
> while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, 
> he was seen as a "Robin Hood-like" figure for many in Colombia, 
> as he provided amenities to the poor. 
> 
> His killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people. 
> Additionally, his private estate, Hacienda Nápoles, has been transformed into a theme park. 
> His life has also served as inspiration for or has been dramatized widely in film, television, and in music.
