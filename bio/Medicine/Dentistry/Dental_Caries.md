> Tooth decay, also known as caries, is the breakdown of teeth 
> due to acids produced by bacteria. 
> 
> The resulting cavities may be many different colors, from yellow to black. 
> Symptoms may include pain and difficulty eating. 
> Complications may include inflammation of the tissue around the tooth, 
> tooth loss and infection or abscess formation. 
> 
> Tooth regeneration is an ongoing stem cell–based field of study 
> that aims to find methods to reverse the effects of decay; 
> current methods are based on easing symptoms.

> The cause of cavities is acid from bacteria dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin, and cementum). The acid is produced by the bacteria when they break down food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's primary energy source, and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than buildup from sources such as saliva, caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva, such as diabetes mellitus, Sjögren syndrome, and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include psychostimulants, antihistamines, and antidepressants. Dental caries are also associated with poverty, poor cleaning of the mouth, and receding gums resulting in exposure of the roots of the teeth.

> Prevention of dental caries includes regular cleaning of the teeth, a diet low in sugar, and small amounts of fluoride. Brushing one's teeth twice per day, and flossing between the teeth once a day is recommended. Fluoride may be acquired from water, salt or toothpaste among other sources. Treating a mother's dental caries may decrease the risk in her children by decreasing the number of certain bacteria she may spread to them. Screening can result in earlier detection. Depending on the extent of destruction, various treatments can be used to restore the tooth to proper function, or the tooth may be removed. There is no known method to grow back large amounts of tooth. The availability of treatment is often poor in the developing world. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be taken for pain.

> Worldwide, approximately 3.6 billion people (48% of the population) have dental caries in their permanent teeth as of 2016. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly all adults have dental caries at some point in time. In baby teeth it affects about 620 million people or 9% of the population. They have become more common in both children and adults in recent years. The disease is most common in the developed world due to greater simple sugar consumption, but less common in the developing world. Caries is Latin for "rottenness".
