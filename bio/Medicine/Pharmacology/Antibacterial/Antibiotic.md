> An **Antibiotic** is a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria. 
> It is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections, 
> and antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections. 
> 
> They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. 
> A limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity. 
> 
> Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the ones which cause the common cold or influenza. 
> Drugs which inhibit growth of viruses are termed [[antiviral]] drugs or antivirals. 
> Antibiotics are also not effective against fungi. 
> Drugs which inhibit growth of fungi are called [[antifungal]] drugs.
>
> Sometimes, the term antibiotic—literally "opposing life", 
> from the Greek roots ἀντι anti, "against" and βίος bios, "life"—
> is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes, 
> but in the usual medical usage, antibiotics (such as penicillin) are those produced naturally 
> (by one microorganism fighting another), 
> whereas non-antibiotic antibacterials (such as sulfonamides and antiseptics) are fully synthetic. 
> 
> However, both classes have the same effect of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms, 
> and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy. 
> "Antibacterials" include bactericides, bacteriostatics, antibacterial soaps, and chemical disinfectants, 
> whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed.

>
> The earliest use of antibiotics was found in northern Sudan, 
> where ancient Sudanese societies as early as 350–550 CE 
> were systematically consuming antibiotics as part of their diet. 
> 
> Chemical analyses of Nubian skeletons show consistent, high levels of tetracycline, a powerful antibiotic. 
> Researchers believe they were brewing beverages from grain fermented with Streptomyces, 
> a bacterium that naturally produces tetracycline. 
> This intentional routine use of antibiotics marks a foundational moment in medical history.
> “Given the amount of tetracycline there, they had to know what they were doing.” — George Armelagos, Biological Anthropologist. 
> Other ancient civilizations including Egypt, China, Serbia, Greece, and Rome, 
> later evidence show topical application of moldy bread to treat infections. 
>
> The first person to directly document the use of molds to treat infections was John Parkinson (1567–1650). 
> Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. 
> 
> Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials 
> began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. 
> Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) discovered modern day penicillin in 1928, 
> the widespread use of which proved significantly beneficial during wartime. 
> 
> The first sulfonamide and the first systemically active antibacterial drug, Prontosil, 
> was developed by a research team led by Gerhard Domagk in 1932 or 1933 
> at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany. 
>
> However, the effectiveness and easy access to antibiotics have also led to their overuse 
> and some bacteria have evolved resistance to them. 
> 
> Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a naturally occurring process, 
> is driven largely by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials. 
> 
> Yet, at the same time, many people around the world do not have access to essential antimicrobials. 
> The World Health Organization has classified AMR as 
> a widespread "serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, 
> it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, 
> of any age, in any country". 
> 
> Each year, nearly 5 million deaths are associated with AMR globally. 
> Global deaths attributable to AMR numbered 1.27 million in 2019.
