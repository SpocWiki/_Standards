## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pharmacokinetics** (from Ancient Greek pharmakon "drug" 
> and kinetikos "moving, putting in motion"; see chemical kinetics), sometimes abbreviated as PK,  
> is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to describing 
> how the body affects a specific substance after administration. 
> 
> The substances of interest include any chemical xenobiotic such as 
> pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, food additives, cosmetics, etc. 
> 
> It attempts to analyze chemical metabolism and to discover the fate of a chemical 
> from the moment that it is administered 
> up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body. 
> 
> Pharmacokinetics is based on mathematical modeling 
> that places great emphasis on the relationship between drug plasma concentration 
> and the time elapsed since the drug's administration. 
> 
> Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects the drug, 
> whereas pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. 
> 
> Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects, as seen in PK/PD models.
