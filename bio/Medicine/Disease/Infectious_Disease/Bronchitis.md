> **Bronchitis** is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs that causes coughing. 
> Bronchitis usually begins as an infection in the nose, ears, throat, or sinuses. 
> The infection then makes its way down to the bronchi. 
> Symptoms include coughing up sputum, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. 
> Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.
>
> Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks, and is also known as a chest cold. 
> In more than 90% of cases, the cause is a viral infection. 
> These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. 
> A small number of cases are caused by a bacterial infection 
> such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. 
> Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. 
> Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), 
> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with the fever.
>
> Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough – one that produces sputum – 
> that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. 
> Many people with chronic bronchitis also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
> Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, 
> with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. 
> Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, 
> and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. 
> Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.
>
> Acute bronchitis is one of the more common diseases. 
> About 5% of adults and 6% of children have at least one episode a year. 
> Acute bronchitis is the most common type of bronchitis. 
> By contrast in the United States, in 2018, 9.3 million people were diagnosed with the less common chronic bronchitis.
