> **Migraine** (UK: , US: ) is a genetically-influenced complex neurological disorder 
> characterized by episodes of moderate-to-severe headache, most often unilateral 
> and generally associated with nausea and light and sound sensitivity. 
> 
> Other characterizing symptoms may include vomiting, cognitive dysfunction, allodynia, and dizziness. 
> Exacerbation or worsening of headache symptoms 
> during physical activity is another distinguishing feature.
>
> Up to one-third of people with migraine experience aura, a premonitory period of sensory disturbance 
> widely accepted to be caused by cortical spreading depression at the onset of a migraine attack. 
> 
> Although primarily considered to be a headache disorder, 
> migraine is highly heterogenous in its clinical presentation 
> and is better thought of as a spectrum disease rather than a distinct clinical entity. 
> Disease burden can range from episodic discrete attacks to chronic disease.
>
> Migraine is believed to be caused by a mixture of environmental and genetic factors 
> that influence the excitation and inhibition of nerve cells in the brain. 
> 
> An incomplete "vascular hypothesis" postulated that 
> the aura of migraine is produced by vasoconstriction 
> and the headache of migraine is produced by vasodilation. 
> This can be triggered by [[Hypothalamus]] Activity. 
> However, the vasoconstrictive mechanism has been disproven, 
> and the role of vasodilation in migraine pathophysiology is uncertain. 
> 
> The accepted hypothesis suggests that multiple primary neuronal impairments 
> lead to a series of intracranial and extracranial changes, 
> triggering a physiological cascade that leads to migraine symptomatology.
>
> Initial recommended treatment for acute attacks is with over-the-counter analgesics (pain medication) 
> such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for headache, 
> antiemetics (anti-nausea medication) for nausea, and the avoidance of migraine triggers. 
> 
> Specific medications such as triptans, ergotamines, 
> or CGRP(calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist) inhibitors may be used 
> in those experiencing headaches that do not respond to the over-the-counter pain medications. 
> 
> For people who experience four or more attacks per month, 
> or could otherwise benefit from prevention, prophylactic medication is recommended. 
> Commonly prescribed prophylactic medications include beta blockers like propranolol, 
> anticonvulsants like sodium valproate, antidepressants like amitriptyline, 
> and other off-label classes of medications. 
> 
> Preventive medications inhibit migraine pathophysiology through various mechanisms, 
> such as blocking calcium and sodium channels, blocking gap junctions, 
> and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases, among other mechanisms. 
> 
> Non-pharmacological preventive therapies include nutritional supplementation, 
> dietary interventions, sleep improvement, and aerobic exercise. 
> In 2018, the first medication (Erenumab) of a new class of drugs
> specifically designed for migraine prevention 
> called CGRPs(calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists) was approved by the FDA. 
> As of July 2023, the FDA has approved eight drugs that act on the CGRP system 
> for use in the treatment of migraine.
>
> Globally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraine. 
> In the Global Burden of Disease Study, conducted in 2010, 
> migraine ranked as the third-most prevalent disorder in the world. 
> 
> It most often starts at puberty and is worst during middle age. 
> As of 2016, it is one of the most common causes of disability.
