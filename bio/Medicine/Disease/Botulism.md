> **Botulism** is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, 
> which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. 
> The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. 
> This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. 
> Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur. 
> The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.
>
> The word is from Latin botulus, meaning 'sausage'.
> 
> Botulism can occur in several ways. 
> The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water and are very resistant. 
> They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. 
> Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. 
> Infant botulism instead happens when the bacterium develops in the intestines 
> and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than one year old, 
> as protective mechanisms against development of the bacterium develop after that age. 
> Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. 
> In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. 
> The disease is not passed directly between people. 
> Its diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question.
>
> Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. 
> The toxin, though not the spores, is 
> destroyed by heating it to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than five minutes. 
> The clostridial spores can be destroyed in an autoclave with 
> - moist heat (120°C/ 250°F for at least 15 minutes) or 
> - dry heat (160°C for 2 hours) or 
> - by irradiation. 
> 
> The spores of group I strains are 
> inactivated by heating at 121°C (250°F) for 3 minutes during commercial canning. 
> Spores of group II strains are less heat-resistant, and they are often damaged by 
> - 90°C (194°F) for 10 minutes, 
> - 85°C for 52 minutes, or 
> - 80°C for 270 minutes; however, these treatments may not be sufficient in some foods. 
> Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, 
> honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. 
> 
> Treatment is with an antitoxin. 
> In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, 
> mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. 
> Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. 
> Botulism also affects many other animals.
