> The etymological origin of oncology is the Greek word ὄγκος (ónkos), 
> meaning "tumor", "volume" or "mass".
>
> Oncology is focused on the diagnosis of cancer in a person, therapy 
> (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other modalities), 
> monitoring of people after treatment, palliative care for people with advanced-stage cancers, 
> ethical questions surrounding cancer care, screening of people who may have cancer, 
> and the study of cancer treatments through clinical research.
>
> An oncologist typically focuses on a specialty area in cancer treatment, 
> such as surgery, radiation, gynecological oncology, geriatric oncology, pediatric oncology, 
> and various organ-specific disciplines (breast, brain, liver, among others).
