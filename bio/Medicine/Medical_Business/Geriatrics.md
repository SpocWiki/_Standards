> **Geriatrics**, or geriatric medicine, is a medical specialty 
> focused on addressing the unique health needs of older adults. 
> 
> The term geriatrics originates from the Greek γέρων geron meaning "old man", 
> and ιατρός iatros meaning "healer". 
> 
> It aims to promote health by preventing, diagnosing and treating disease in older adults. Older adults may be healthy, but they're more likely to have chronic health concerns and require more medical care. There is not a defined age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of older people. Rather, this decision is guided by individual patient needs and the caregiving structures available to them. This care may benefit those who are managing multiple chronic conditions or experiencing significant age-related complications that threaten quality of daily life. Geriatric care may be indicated if caregiving responsibilities become increasingly stressful or medically complex for family and caregivers to manage independently.
>
> There is a distinction between geriatrics and gerontology. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary study of the aging process, defined as the decline in organ function over time in the absence of injury, illness, environmental risks or behavioral risk factors. However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.
