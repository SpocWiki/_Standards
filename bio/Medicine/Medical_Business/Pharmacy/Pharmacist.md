> A **Pharmacist**, also known as a chemist in Commonwealth English, 
> is a healthcare professional who is knowledgeable about preparation, 
> mechanism of action, clinical usage and legislation of medications 
> in order to dispense them safely to the public and to provide consultancy services. 
> 
> A pharmacist also often serves as a primary care provider in the community 
> and offers services, such as health screenings and immunizations.
>
> Pharmacists undergo university or graduate-level education 
> to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, 
> therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. 
> 
> In developing countries, a diploma course from approved colleges qualifies one for pharmacist role. 
> This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. 
> 
> Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge 
> to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.
>
> Among other licensing requirements, different countries 
> require pharmacists to hold either a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Master of Pharmacy, 
> or a Doctor of Pharmacy degree.
>
> The most common pharmacist positions are that of a community pharmacist 
> (also referred to as a retail pharmacist, first-line pharmacist or dispensing chemist), 
> or a hospital pharmacist, where they instruct and counsel on the proper use and adverse effects of medically prescribed drugs and medicines. In most countries, the profession is subject to professional regulation. Depending on the legal scope of practice, pharmacists may contribute to prescribing (also referred to as "pharmacist prescribers") and administering certain medications (e.g., immunizations) in some jurisdictions. Pharmacists may also practice in a variety of other settings, including industry, wholesaling, research, academia, formulary management, military, and government.
