> Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (German: [ˈɪɡnaːts ˈzɛml̩vaɪs];
>  Hungarian: Semmelweis Ignác Fülöp [ˈsɛmmɛlvɛjs ˈiɡnaːts ˈfyløp]; 1 July 1818 – 13 August 1865) 
> was a Hungarian physician and scientist of German descent, 
> who was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures, 
> and was described as the "saviour of mothers". 
> 
> Postpartum infection, also known as puerperal fever or childbed fever, 
> consists of any bacterial infection of the reproductive tract following birth, 
> and in the 19th century was common and often fatal.  
> 
> Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of infection could be drastically reduced 
> by requiring healthcare workers in obstetrical clinics to disinfect their hands. 
> 
> In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions 
> at Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, 
> where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards. 
> 
> The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, 
> and he published a book of his findings, [[Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever]] in 1861.
>
> Despite his research, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific 
> and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. 
> He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings of reduced mortality 
> due to hand-washing, and some doctors were offended 
> at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. 
> 
> In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown 
> and was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. 
> In the asylum he was beaten by the guards. 
> He died 14 days later from a gangrenous wound on his right hand 
> that may have been caused by the beating.
>
> His findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, 
> when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory, 
> giving Semmelweis' observations a theoretical explanation, and Joseph Lister, 
> acting on Pasteur's research, practised and operated using hygienic methods, with great success.
