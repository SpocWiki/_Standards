> Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood products 
> into a person's circulation intravenously. 
> 
> Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. 
> Early transfusions used whole blood, 
> but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, 
> such as red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and other clotting factors. 
> 
> White blood cells are transfused only in very rare circumstances, 
> since granulocyte transfusion has limited applications. 
> Whole blood has come back into use in the trauma setting.
>
> Red blood cells (RBC) contain hemoglobin and supply the cells of the body with oxygen. 
> White blood cells are not commonly used during transfusions, 
> but they are part of the immune system and also fight infections. 
> Plasma is the "yellowish" liquid part of blood, which acts as a buffer 
> and contains proteins and other important substances needed for the body's overall health. 
> 
> Platelets are involved in blood clotting, preventing the body from bleeding. 
> Before these components were known, doctors believed that blood was homogeneous. 
> Because of this scientific misunderstanding, 
> many patients died because of incompatible blood transferred to them.
