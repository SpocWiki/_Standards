> **Urinalysis**, a portmanteau of the words urine and analysis, 
> is a panel of medical tests that includes physical (macroscopic) examination of the urine, 
> chemical evaluation using urine test strips, and microscopic examination. 
> 
> Macroscopic examination targets parameters such as color, clarity, odor, and specific gravity; 
> urine test strips measure chemical properties such as pH, glucose concentration, 
> and protein levels; and microscopy is performed to identify elements such as 
> cells, urinary casts, crystals, and organisms.
