## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In biology, a **Pathogen** (Greek: πάθος, pathos "suffering", "passion" and -γενής, -genēs "producer of"), 
> in the oldest and broadest sense, is any organism or agent that can produce disease. 
> A pathogen may also be referred to as an infectious agent, or simply a germ.
>
> The term pathogen came into use in the 1880s. 
> Typically, the term pathogen is used to describe an infectious microorganism or agent, 
> such as a virus, bacterium, protozoan, prion, viroid, or fungus. 
> 
> Small animals, such as helminths and insects, can also cause or transmit disease. 
> However, these animals are usually referred to as parasites rather than pathogens. 
> The scientific study of microscopic organisms, including microscopic pathogenic organisms, 
> is called microbiology, 
> while parasitology refers to the scientific study of parasites and the organisms that host them.
>
> There are several pathways through which pathogens can invade a host. 
> The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, 
> but **soil has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen**.
>
> Diseases in humans that are caused by infectious agents are known as pathogenic diseases. 
> Not all diseases are caused by pathogens, such as 
> - black lung from exposure to the pollutant coal dust, 
> - genetic disorders like sickle cell disease, and 
> - autoimmune diseases like lupus.
