## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A neoplasm is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. 
> The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. 
> 
> The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, 
> and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed. 
> This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, which may be called a tumour or **Tumor**.
>
> ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: 
> - benign neoplasms, 
> - in situ neoplasms, 
> - malignant neoplasms, and 
> - neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior. 
> 
> Malignant neoplasms are also simply known as cancers and are the focus of oncology.
>
> Prior to the abnormal growth of tissue, such as neoplasia, 
> cells often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as metaplasia or dysplasia. 
> 
> However, metaplasia or dysplasia does not always progress to neoplasia 
> and can occur in other conditions as well. 
> 
> The word neoplasm is from Ancient Greek νέος- neo 'new' and πλάσμα plasma 'formation, creation'.
