> The **Hypothalamus** (pl.: hypothalami; from Ancient Greek  ὑπό (hupó) 'under' 
> and  θάλαμος (thálamos) 'chamber') is a small part of the vertebrate brain 
> that contains a number of nuclei with a variety of functions. 
> 
> One of the most important functions is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system 
> via the pituitary gland. 
> The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system. I
> t forms the basal part of the diencephalon. 
> All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is about the size of an almond.
>
> The hypothalamus has the function of regulating certain metabolic processes 
> and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. 
> 
> It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing or hypothalamic hormones, 
> and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. 
> The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, circadian rhythms, 
> important aspects of parenting and maternal attachment behaviours, 
> and is important in certain social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors.
