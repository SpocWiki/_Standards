## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Bubonic plague is one of three types of plague caused by the [[../../../../bio~Domain/Bacteria|bacterium]] Yersinia pestis. 
> One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu-like symptoms develop. 
> These symptoms include fever, headaches, and vomiting, as well as swollen and painful lymph nodes 
> occurring in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin. 
> Acral necrosis, the dark discoloration of skin, is another symptom. 
> Occasionally, swollen lymph nodes, known as "buboes", may break open.
>
> The three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: 
> bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. 
> 
> Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals. 
> It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague-infected animal. 
> Mammals such as rabbits, hares, and some cat species are susceptible to bubonic plague, 
> and typically die upon contraction. 
> 
> In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite 
> and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. 
> Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.
>
> Prevention is through public health measures such as 
> not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common. 
> While vaccines against the plague have been developed, 
> the World Health Organization recommends that only high-risk groups, 
> such as certain laboratory personnel and health care workers, get inoculated. 
> Several antibiotics are effective for treatment, including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.
>
> Without treatment, plague results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. 
> Death, if it occurs, is typically within 10 days. With treatment, the risk of death is around 10%. 
> Globally between 2010 and 2015 there were 3,248 documented cases, which resulted in 584 deaths. 
> The countries with the greatest number of cases are the [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/Africa/Africa~Central/Congo~Kinshasa|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/Africa/Africa~East/Madagascar|Madagascar]], and [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/America~South/Andes/Peru|Peru]].
>
> The plague is considered the likely cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, 
> and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people, 
> including about 25% to 60% of the European population. 
> Because the plague killed so many of the working population, 
> wages rose due to the demand for labor. 
> 
> Some historians see this as a turning point in European economic development. 
> The disease is also considered to have been responsible for the Plague of Justinian, 
> originating in the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE, 
> as well as the third epidemic, affecting [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/Asia/Asia~East/China|China]], [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/Asia/Asia~East/Mongolia|Mongolia]], and [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/Asia/Asia~South/India|India]], 
> originating in the Yunnan Province in 1855. 
> The term bubonic is derived from the Greek word βουβών, meaning 'groin'.
