> **Anthrax** is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis or Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis. 
> Infection typically occurs by contact with the skin, inhalation, or intestinal absorption. 
> Symptom onset occurs between one day and more than two months after the infection is contracted. 
> The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling 
> that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center. 
> The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath. 
> The intestinal form presents with diarrhea (which may contain blood), 
> abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting.
>
> According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
> the first clinical descriptions of cutaneous anthrax were given by Maret in 1752 and Fournier in 1769. 
> Before that, anthrax had been described only in historical accounts. 
> The German scientist Robert Koch was the first 
> to identify Bacillus anthracis as the bacterium that causes anthrax.
>
> Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium's spores, which often appear in infectious animal products. 
> Contact is by breathing or eating or through an area of broken skin. 
> It does not typically spread directly between people. 
> 
> Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products, and military personnel. 
> Diagnosis can be confirmed by finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood 
> or by culture of a sample from the infected site.
>
> Anthrax vaccination is recommended for people at high risk of infection. 
> Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. 
> A two-month course of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin 
> and doxycycline after exposure can also prevent infection. 
> If infection occurs, treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin. 
> The type and number of antibiotics used depend on the type of infection. 
> Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.
>
> A rare disease, human anthrax is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia. 
> It also occurs more regularly in Southern Europe than elsewhere on the continent 
> and is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America. 
> 
> Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year, with about two cases a year in the United States. 
> Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases. 
> Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 23.7%. 
> For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 to 75%, 
> while respiratory anthrax has a mortality of 50 to 80%, even with treatment. 
> 
> Until the 20th century anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and animals each year. 
> In herbivorous animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing. 
> Humans may become infected by killing and/or eating infected animals.
>
> Several countries have developed anthrax as a weapon. 
> It has been used in biowarfare and bioterrorism since 1914. 
> In 1975, the Biological Weapons Convention 
> prohibited the "development, production and stockpiling" of biological weapons. 
> It has since been used in bioterrorism. 
> Likely delivery methods of weaponized anthrax include aerial dispersal or dispersal through livestock; 
> notable bioterrorism uses include the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States 
> and an incident in 1993 by the Aum Shinrikyo group in Japan.
