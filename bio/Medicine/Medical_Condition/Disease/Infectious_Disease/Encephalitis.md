> **Encephalitis** is inflammation of the brain. 
> The severity can be variable with symptoms including reduction or alteration in consciousness, 
> aphasia, headache, fever, confusion, a stiff neck, and vomiting. 
> Complications may include seizures, hallucinations, trouble speaking, memory problems, 
> and problems with hearing.
>
> Causes of encephalitis include viruses such as herpes simplex virus and rabies virus 
> as well as bacteria, fungi, or parasites. 
> 
> Other causes include autoimmune diseases and certain medications. 
> In many cases the cause remains unknown. 
> Risk factors include a weak immune system. 
> Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by blood tests, 
> medical imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.
>
> Certain types are preventable with vaccines. 
> Treatment may include antiviral medications (such as acyclovir), 
> anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids. 
> 
> Treatment generally takes place in hospital. Some people require artificial respiration. 
> Once the immediate problem is under control, rehabilitation may be required. 
> In 2015, encephalitis was estimated to have affected 4.3 million people 
> and resulted in 150,000 deaths worldwide.
