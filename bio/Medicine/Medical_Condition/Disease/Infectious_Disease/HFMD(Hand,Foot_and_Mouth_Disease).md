## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infection 
> caused by a group of enteroviruses. 
> 
> It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. 
> This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, 
> on the hands, feet and mouth and occasionally buttocks and groin. 
> Signs and symptoms normally appear 3â€“6 days after exposure to the virus. 
> The rash generally resolves on its own in about a week. 
>
> The viruses that cause HFMD are spread through close personal contact, 
> through the air from coughing, and via the feces of an infected person. 
> 
> Contaminated objects can also spread the disease. 
> Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause, 
> and enterovirus 71 is the second-most common cause. 
> Other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible. 
> 
> Some people may carry and pass on the virus despite having no symptoms of disease. 
> No animals are involved in transmission. 
> Diagnosis can often be made based on symptoms. 
> Occasionally, a throat or stool sample may be tested for the virus.
>
> Most people with hand, foot, and mouth disease get better on their own in 7 to 10 days. 
> Most cases require no specific treatment. 
> 
> No antiviral medication or vaccine is available, but development efforts are underway. 
> For fever and for painful mouth sores, over-the-counter pain medications 
> such as ibuprofen may be used, though aspirin should be avoided in children. 
> 
> The illness is usually not serious. 
> Occasionally, intravenous fluids are given to children who are dehydrated. 
> Very rarely, viral meningitis or encephalitis may complicate the disease. 
> 
> Because HFMD is normally mild, 
> some jurisdictions allow children to continue to go to child care and schools 
> as long as they have no fever or uncontrolled drooling with mouth sores, 
> and as long as they feel well enough to participate in classroom activities.
>
> HFMD occurs in all areas of the world. 
> It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. 
> Large outbreaks have been occurring in Asia since 1997. 
> 
> It usually occurs during the spring, summer, and fall months. 
> Typically it occurs in children less than five years old but can occasionally occur in adults. 
> HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease 
> (also known as [[Hoof-and-Mouth_Disease]]), which mostly affects livestock.
