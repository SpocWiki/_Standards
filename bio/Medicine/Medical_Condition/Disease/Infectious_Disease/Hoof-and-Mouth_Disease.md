> Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or **hoof-and-mouth disease** (HMD) 
> is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease 
> that primarily affects even-toed ungulates, including domestic and wild bovids. 
> The virus causes a high fever lasting two to six days, 
> followed by blisters inside the mouth and near the hoof that may rupture and cause lameness.
>
> FMD has very severe implications for animal farming, 
> since it is highly infectious and can be spread by infected animals comparatively easily 
> through contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing, and feed, 
> and by domestic and wild predators. 
> 
> Its containment demands considerable efforts in vaccination, strict monitoring, 
> trade restrictions, quarantines, and the culling of both infected and healthy (uninfected) animals.
>
> Susceptible animals include cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, antelope, deer, and bison. 
> 
> It has also been known to infect hedgehogs and elephants; 
> llamas and alpacas may develop mild symptoms, but are resistant to the disease 
> and do not pass it on to others of the same species. 
> 
> In laboratory experiments, mice, rats, and chickens have been artificially infected, 
> but they are not believed to contract the disease under natural conditions. 
> 
> Cattle, Asian and African buffalo, sheep, and goats 
> can become carriers following an acute infection, 
> meaning they are still infected with a small amount of virus but appear healthy. 
> 
> Animals can be carriers for up to 1–2 years and are considered 
> very unlikely to infect other animals, 
> although laboratory evidence suggests that transmission from carriers is possible.
>
> Humans are only extremely rarely infected by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV).  
> 
> However, humans, particularly young children, 
> can be affected by hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), 
> which is also a viral infection caused by multiple viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family, but it is distinct from FMD.
>
> The virus responsible for FMD is an aphthovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus. 
> Infection occurs when the virus particle is taken into a cell of the host. 
> The cell is then forced to manufacture thousands of copies of the virus, 
> and eventually bursts, releasing the new particles in the blood. 
> The virus is genetically highly variable, which limits the effectiveness of vaccination. 
> The disease was first documented in 1870.
