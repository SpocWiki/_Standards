> **Scabies** (SKAY-b(ee-)eez; also sometimes known as the seven-year itch) 
> is a contagious human skin infestation by the tiny (0.2–0.45 mm) mite Sarcoptes scabiei, variety hominis. 
> 
> The word is from Latin: scabere, lit. 'to scratch'. 
> The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash. Occasionally, tiny burrows may appear on the skin from eggs that are about to hatch. In a first-ever infection, the infected person usually develops symptoms within two to six weeks. During a second infection, symptoms may begin within 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just in certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. The itch is often worse at night. Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection in the skin.
>
> Various names have been given to this condition and the name 'seven year itch' has been recorded in many documents from the 1800s. Although the 1952 play The Seven Year Itch and modern treatment methods have generally changed this name to refer to human relationships, the condition was historically very difficult to treat.  
>
> Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, an ectoparasite. The mites burrow into the skin to live and deposit eggs. The symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to the mites. Often, only between 10 and 15 mites are involved in an infection. Scabies most often spreads during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sexual activity or living together. Spread of the disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher disease rates. Crusted scabies is a more severe form of the disease, not essentially different but an infestation by huge numbers of mites that typically only affects those with a poor immune system; the number of mites also makes them much more contagious. In these cases, the spread of infection may occur during brief contact or by contaminated objects. The mite is tiny and at the limit of detection with the human eye.  It is not readily obvious; factors that aid in detection are good lighting, magnification, and knowing what to look for. Diagnosis is based either on detecting the mite (confirmed scabies), detecting typical lesions in a typical distribution with typical histological features (clinical scabies), or detecting atypical lesions or atypical distribution of lesions with only some histological features present (suspected scabies).
>
> Several medications are available to treat those infected, including oral and topical ivermectin, permethrin, crotamiton, and lindane creams. Sexual contacts within the last month and people who live in the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.
>
> Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, 
> along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections. 
> 
> As of 2015, it affects about 204 million people (2.8% of the world population). 
> It is equally common in both sexes. The young and the old are more commonly affected. 
> 
> It also occurs more commonly in the developing world and tropical climates. 
> Other animals do not spread human scabies; 
> similar infection in other animals is known as sarcoptic mange, 
> and is typically caused by slightly different but related mites.
