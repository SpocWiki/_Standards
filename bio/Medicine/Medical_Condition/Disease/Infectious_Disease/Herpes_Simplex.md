> Herpes simplex, often known simply as herpes, 
> is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. 
> 
> Herpes infections are categorized by the area of the body that is infected. 
> The two major types of herpes are oral herpes and genital herpes, though other forms also exist.
>
> Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups, 
> often called cold sores or fever blisters, or may just cause a sore throat. 
> Genital herpes involves the genitalia. 
> 
> It may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. 
> These typically heal over two to four weeks. 
> Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear.
>
> Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. 
> The first episode is often more severe 
> and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. 
> Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity.
>
> Herpetic whitlow typically involves the fingers or thumb, 
> herpes simplex keratitis involves the eye, herpesviral encephalitis involves the brain, 
> and neonatal herpes involves any part of the body of a newborn, among others.
>
> There are two types of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). 
> HSV-1 more commonly causes infections around the mouth 
> while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. 
> 
> They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. 
> 
> Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. 
> 
> Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. 
> It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. 
> 
> After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. 
> Causes of recurrence may include decreased immune function, 
> stress, and sunlight exposure. 
> 
> Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. 
> The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. 
> Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.
>
> The most effective method of avoiding genital infections is 
> by avoiding vaginal, oral, manual, and anal sex. 
> Condom use decreases the risk. 
> 
> Daily antiviral medication taken by someone who has the infection can also reduce spread. 
> There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. 
> Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine may be used to help with the symptoms. 
> Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.
>
> Worldwide rates of either HSV-1 or HSV-2 are between 60% and 95% in adults. 
> HSV-1 is usually acquired during childhood. 
> Since there is no cure for either HSV-1 or HSV-2, rates of both inherently increase as people age. 
> 
> Rates of HSV-1 are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status 
> and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. 
> 
> An estimated 536 million people worldwide (16% of the population) 
> were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 
> with greater rates among women and those in the developing world. 
> Most people with HSV-2 do not realize that they are infected.
