> Cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, chronic liver failure or chronic hepatic failure and end-stage liver disease, is a chronic condition of the liver 
> in which the normal functioning tissue, or parenchyma, is replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis) 
> and regenerative nodules as a result of chronic liver disease. 
> 
> Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. 
> Over time, scar tissue and nodules of regenerating hepatocytes can replace the parenchyma, 
> causing increased resistance to blood flow in the liver's capillaries—the hepatic sinusoids—
> and consequently portal hypertension, as well as impairment in other aspects of liver function.
>
> The disease typically develops slowly over months or years. 
> Stages include compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.  
> Early symptoms may include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, 
> nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
> 
> As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness, swelling in the lower legs, 
> fluid build-up in the abdomen, jaundice, bruising easily, and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin. The fluid build-up in the abdomen may develop into spontaneous infections. More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines, and liver cancer.
>
> Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by medical conditions including alcohol-related liver disease, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH – the progressive form of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, previously called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD), heroin abuse, chronic hepatitis B, and chronic hepatitis C. Chronic heavy drinking can cause alcoholic liver disease. Liver damage has also been attributed to heroin usage over an extended period of time as well. MASH has several causes, including obesity, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupts bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis, and chronic heart failure with liver congestion.
>
> Diagnosis is based on blood tests, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.
>
> Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B and the development of cirrhosis from it, but no vaccination against hepatitis C is available. No specific treatment for cirrhosis is known, but many of the underlying causes may be treated by medications that may slow or prevent worsening of the condition.  Hepatitis B and C may be treatable with antiviral medications. Avoiding alcohol is recommended in all cases. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with steroid medications. Ursodiol may be useful if the disease is due to blockage of the bile duct. Other medications may be useful for complications such as abdominal or leg swelling, hepatic encephalopathy, and dilated esophageal veins. If cirrhosis leads to liver failure, a liver transplant may be an option.  Biannual screening for liver cancer using abdominal ultrasound, possibly with additional blood tests, is recommended due to the high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from dysplastic nodules.
>
> Cirrhosis affected about 2.8 million people and resulted in 1.3 million deaths in 2015. Of these deaths, alcohol caused 348,000 (27%), hepatitis C caused 326,000 (25%), and hepatitis B caused 371,000 (28%). In the United States, more men die of cirrhosis than women. The first known description of the condition is by Hippocrates in the fifth century BCE. The term "cirrhosis" was derived in 1819 from the Greek word "kirrhos", which describes the yellowish color of a diseased liver.
