> Colorectal cancer, also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, 
> is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). 
> 
> It is the consequence of uncontrolled growth of colon cells 
> that can invade/spread to other parts of the body. 
> 
> Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, 
> weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. 
> 
> Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. 
> Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. 
> Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol. 
> 
> Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, 
> which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
> Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include 
> familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; 
> however, these represent less than 5% of cases. 
> 
> It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, 
> which over time becomes cancerous.
>
> Colorectal cancer may be diagnosed 
> by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. 
> 
> This is then followed by medical imaging to determine 
> whether the cancer has spread beyond the colon or is in situ. 
> 
> Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. 
> 
> Screening, by one of several methods, is recommended starting from ages 45 to 75. 
> It was recommended starting at age 50 
> but it was changed to 45 due to increasing numbers of colon cancers. 
> 
> During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. 
> If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. 
> Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.
>
> Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014. The chances of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether all of the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third-most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases. In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease (Only colon cancer, rectal cancer is not included in this statistic). It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.
