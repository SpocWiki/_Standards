> An **Autoimmune disease** is a condition that results from an anomalous response of the adaptive immune system, wherein it mistakenly targets and attacks healthy, functioning parts of the body as if they were foreign organisms. It is estimated that there are more than 80 recognized autoimmune diseases, with recent scientific evidence suggesting the existence of potentially more than 100 distinct conditions. Nearly any body part can be involved.
>
> Autoimmune diseases are a separate class from autoinflammatory diseases. Both are characterized by an immune system malfunction which may cause similar symptoms, such as rash, swelling, or fatigue, but the cardinal cause or mechanism of the diseases is different. A key difference is a malfunction of the innate immune system in autoinflammatory diseases, whereas in autoimmune diseases there is a malfunction of the adaptive immune system.
>
> Symptoms of autoimmune diseases can significantly vary, primarily based on the specific type of the disease and the body part that it affects. Symptoms are often diverse and can be fleeting, fluctuating from mild to severe, and typically comprise low-grade fever, fatigue, and general malaise. However, some autoimmune diseases may present with more specific symptoms such as joint pain, skin rashes (e.g., urticaria), or neurological symptoms.
>
> The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain unclear and are likely multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental influences. While some diseases like lupus exhibit familial aggregation, suggesting a genetic predisposition, other cases have been associated with infectious triggers or exposure to environmental factors, implying a complex interplay between genes and environment in their etiology.
>
> Some of the most common diseases that are generally categorized as autoimmune include coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), multiple sclerosis, alopecia areata, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging due to their diverse presentations and the transient nature of many symptoms.
>
> Treatment modalities for autoimmune diseases vary based on the type of disease and its severity. Therapeutic approaches primarily aim to manage symptoms, reduce immune system activity, and maintain the body's ability to fight diseases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunosuppressants are commonly used to reduce inflammation and control the overactive immune response. In certain cases, intravenous immunoglobulin may be administered to regulate the immune system. Despite these treatments often leading to symptom improvement, they usually do not offer a cure and long-term management is often required.
>
> In terms of prevalence, a UK study found that 10% of the population were affected by an autoimmune disease. Women are more commonly affected than men. Autoimmune diseases predominantly begin in adulthood, although they can start at any age. The initial recognition of autoimmune diseases dates back to the early 1900s, and since then, advances in understanding and management of these conditions have been substantial, though much more is needed to fully unravel their complex etiology and pathophysiology.
