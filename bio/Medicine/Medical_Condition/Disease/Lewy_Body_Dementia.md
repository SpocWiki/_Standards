It is one of the most common types of dementia, after[[Autoimmune_Disease/Alzheimer's_Disease]]].

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Lewy body dementia** (LBD) is an umbrella term for two similar and common subtypes of dementia: 
> dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). 
> Both are characterized by changes in thinking, movement, behavior, and mood. 
> 
> The two conditions have similar features and may have similar causes, 
> and are believed to belong on a spectrum of Lewy body disease that includes Parkinson's disease.  
> As of 2014, they were more often misdiagnosed than any other common dementia.
>
> The exact cause is unknown, but involves widespread deposits of abnormal clumps of protein 
> that form in neurons of the diseased brain. 
> Known as Lewy bodies (discovered in 1912 by Frederic Lewy) and Lewy neurites, 
> these clumps affect both the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. 
> The fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) 
> gives Lewy body disease as the causative subtype of dementia with Lewy bodies, 
> and Parkinson's disease as the causative subtype of Parkinson's disease dementia. 
> Dementia with Lewy bodies is marked by the presence of Lewy bodies in the cortical regions, 
> and Parkinson's disease dementia with Lewy bodies primarily in the subcortical basal ganglia.
