## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Epilepsy** is a group of non-communicable neurological disorders 
> characterized by a tendency for recurrent, unprovoked seizures. 
> 
> A seizure is a sudden burst of abnormal electrical activity in the brain 
> that can cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from brief lapses of awareness or muscle jerks to prolonged convulsions. 
> 
> These episodes can result in physical injuries, either directly, such as broken bones, or through causing accidents. 
> The diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart. 
> In some cases, however, it may be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure 
> if clinical evidence suggests a high risk of recurrence. 
> 
> Isolated seizures that occur without recurrence risk or are provoked by identifiable causes 
> are not considered indicative of epilepsy.
>
> The underlying cause is often unknown, but epilepsy can result from brain injury, 
> stroke, infections, tumors, genetic conditions, or developmental abnormalities. 
> 
> Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. 
> Diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that can resemble seizures, 
> and may include neuroimaging, blood tests, and electroencephalography (EEG).
>
> Most cases of epilepsy — approximately 69% — can be effectively controlled with anti-seizure medications, 
> and inexpensive treatment options are widely available. 
> 
> For those whose seizures do not respond to drugs, other approaches, such as 
> surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes, may be considered. 
> Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.
>
> As of 2021, approximately 51 million people worldwide have epilepsy, 
> with nearly 80% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. 
> 
> The burden of epilepsy in low-income countries is more than twice that in high-income countries, 
> likely due to higher exposure to risk factors such as perinatal injury, infections, 
> and traumatic brain injury, combined with limited access to healthcare. 
> In 2021, epilepsy was responsible for an estimated 140,000 deaths, an increase from 125,000 in 1990.
>
> Epilepsy is more common in both children and older adults. 
> About 5–10% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80. 
> The chance of experiencing a second seizure within two years after the first is around 40%. 
>
> People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world 
> and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to the alarming nature of their symptoms. 
> 
> In many countries, people with epilepsy face driving restrictions 
> and must be seizure-free for a set period before regaining eligibility to drive. 
> 
> The word epilepsy is from Ancient Greek ἐπιλαμβάνειν, 'to seize, possess, or afflict'.
