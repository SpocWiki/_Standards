> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease 
> characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. 
> 
> GOLD defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, sputum production or exacerbations) 
> due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) or alveoli (emphysema) 
> that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.
>
> The main symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath and a cough, 
> which may or may not produce mucus. 
> COPD progressively worsens, with everyday activities such as walking or dressing becoming difficult. 
> While COPD is incurable, it is preventable and treatable. 
> The two most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, 
> and have been the two classic COPD phenotypes. 
> 
> However, this basic dogma has been challenged as varying 
> degrees of co-existing emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and potentially significant vascular diseases 
> have all been acknowledged in those with COPD, 
> giving rise to the classification of other phenotypes or subtypes.
>
> Emphysema is defined as enlarged airspaces (alveoli) whose walls have broken down, 
> resulting in permanent damage to the lung tissue. 
> Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough 
> that is present for at least three months each year for two years. 
> 
> Both of these conditions can exist without airflow limitations when they are not classed as COPD. 
> Emphysema is just one of the structural abnormalities that can limit airflow 
> and can exist without airflow limitation in a significant number of people. 
> 
> Chronic bronchitis does not always result in airflow limitation. 
> However, in young adults with chronic bronchitis who smoke, the risk of developing COPD is high. 
> Many definitions of COPD in the past included emphysema and chronic bronchitis, 
> but these have never been included in GOLD report definitions. 
> 
> Emphysema and chronic bronchitis remain the predominant phenotypes of COPD, 
> but there is often overlap between them, and several other phenotypes have also been described. 
> COPD and asthma may coexist and converge in some individuals. 
> COPD is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation.
>
> The most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoking. 
> Other risk factors include indoor and outdoor air pollution including dust, 
> exposure to occupational irritants such as dust from grains, cadmium dust 
> or fumes, and genetics, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. 
> 
> In developing countries, common sources of household air pollution 
> are the use of coal and biomass such as wood and dry dung as fuel for cooking and heating. 
> The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by spirometry.
>
> Most cases of COPD can be prevented 
> by reducing exposure to risk factors such as smoking and indoor and outdoor pollutants. 
> While treatment can slow worsening, 
> there is no conclusive evidence that any medications can change the long-term decline in lung function. 
> 
> COPD treatments include smoking cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, 
> inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. 
> 
> Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy, 
> lung volume reduction and lung transplantation. 
> In those who have periods of acute worsening, 
> increased use of medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids and hospitalization may be needed.
>
> As of 2021, COPD affected about 213 million people (2.7% of the global population). 
> It typically occurs in males and females over the age of 35–40. 
> In 2021, COPD caused 3.65 million deaths. 
> 
> Almost 90% of COPD deaths in those under 70 years of age occur in low and middle income countries. 
> In 2021, it was the fourth biggest cause of death, responsible for approximately 5% of total deaths. 
> The number of deaths is projected to increase further 
> because of continued exposure to risk factors and an aging population. 
> In the United States, costs of the disease were estimated in 2010 at $50 billion, 
> most of which is due to exacerbation.
