> Color vision, a feature of visual perception, 
> is an ability to perceive differences between 
> light composed of different frequencies independently of light intensity.
>
> Color perception is a part of the larger visual system 
> and is mediated by a complex process between neurons 
> that begins with differential stimulation of different types of photoreceptors by light entering the eye. 
> 
> Those photoreceptors then emit outputs that are propagated through many layers of neurons ultimately leading to higher cognitive functions in the brain. Color vision is found in many animals and is mediated by similar underlying mechanisms with common types of biological molecules and a complex history of the evolution of color vision within different animal taxa. In primates, color vision may have evolved under selective pressure for a variety of visual tasks including the foraging for nutritious young leaves, ripe fruit, and flowers, as well as detecting predator camouflage and emotional states in other primates.
