## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability (in the United Kingdom), 
> and formerly mental retardation (in the United States), 
> is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder 
> characterized by significant impairment in intellectual and adaptive functioning 
> that is first apparent during childhood. 
> 
> Children with intellectual disabilities typically have an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70 
> and deficits in at least two adaptive behaviors that affect everyday living. 
> According to the DSM-5, intellectual functions include reasoning, problem solving, 
> planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. 
> 
> Deficits in these functions must be confirmed by clinical evaluation 
> and individualized standard IQ testing. 
> On the other hand, adaptive behaviors include the social, developmental, and practical skills 
> people learn to perform tasks in their everyday lives. 
> Deficits in adaptive functioning often compromise an individual's independence 
> and ability to meet their social responsibility.
>
> Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.
>
> Intellectual disability affects about 2–3% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic, or idiopathic cases account for 30–50% of these cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013.
