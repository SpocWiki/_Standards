> In science, **Poison** is one of the chemical substances that is harmful or lethal to a living organism. 
> The term of poison is used in a wide range of scientific fields and industries, 
> where it is often specifically defined. 
> It may also be applied colloquially or figuratively, with a broad sense. 
>
> The symptoms and effects of poisoning in humans can mimic those of other medical conditions and vary depending on the type of poison and the system of the body affected. Common symptoms include alterations in consciousness, abnormal body temperature, irregular heart rate, and changes in respiration. The severity and specific presentation of symptoms often depend on the nature and dose of the poison involved.
>
> Certain poisons, particularly caustic or irritating substances, can cause direct injury to mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. These injuries may result in symptoms such as pain, coughing, vomiting, and shortness of breath.
>
> The term poisoning refers to the harmful physiological effects that result from the exposure to a toxic substance, typically through ingestion, inhalation, injection, or skin absorption. It is derived from the word poison and is commonly used in medical, biochemical, and toxicological contexts to describe adverse interactions between a substance and a living organism.
>
> Poisoning is sometimes used as a method of self-harm, particularly in cases of intentional self-poisoning among individuals experiencing suicidal ideation. According to Time Magazine, self-poisoning is one of the leading methods of suicide attempts among adolescents, and has been identified as the third-leading cause of suicide-related deaths in this age group. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that suicide attempts by poisoning among individuals under the age of 19 doubled between 2000 and 2018, increasing from nearly 40,000 cases to almost 80,000.
>
> During the COVID-19 lockdowns, reports indicated a 37% increase in cases of deliberate self-poisoning among adolescent girls. In biology, a poison is a chemical substance causing death, injury or harm to organisms or their parts. In medicine, poisons are a kind of toxin that are delivered passively, not actively. In industry the term may be negative, something to be removed to make a thing safe, or positive, an agent to limit unwanted pests. In ecological terms, poisons introduced into the environment can later cause unwanted effects elsewhere, or in other parts of the food chain.
