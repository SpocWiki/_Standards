> A **Wound** is any damage to living tissue, such as skin, mucous membranes, or organs. 
> 
> Wounds can either be the sudden result of direct trauma (mechanical, thermal, chemical), 
> or can develop slowly over time due to underlying disease processes such as 
> diabetes mellitus, venous/arterial insufficiency, or immunologic disease. 
> 
> Wounds can vary greatly in their appearance depending on wound location, injury mechanism, depth of injury, timing of onset (acute vs chronic), and wound sterility, among other factors. 
> 
> Treatment strategies for wounds will vary based on the classification of the wound, 
> therefore it is essential that wounds be thoroughly evaluated by a healthcare professional 
> for proper management. 
> 
> In normal physiology, all wounds will undergo 
> a series of steps collectively known as the wound healing process, 
> which include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. 
> 
> Age, tissue oxygenation, stress, underlying medical conditions, and certain medications 
> are just a few of the many factors known to affect the rate of wound healing.
