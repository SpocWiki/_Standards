## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Obstetrics and gynaecology (also spelled as obstetrics and gynecology; 
> abbreviated as Obst and Gynae, O&G, OB-GYN and OB/GYN) 
> is the medical specialty that encompasses the two subspecialties of 
> - obstetrics (covering pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period) and 
> - gynaecology (covering the health of the female reproductive system  â€“ vagina, uterus, ovaries, and breasts). 
> The specialization is an important part of care for women's health.
>
> Postgraduate training programs for both fields are usually combined, 
> preparing the practising obstetrician-gynecologist to be adept both 
> at the care of female reproductive organs' health and at the management of pregnancy, 
> although many doctors go on to develop subspecialty interests in one field or the other.
