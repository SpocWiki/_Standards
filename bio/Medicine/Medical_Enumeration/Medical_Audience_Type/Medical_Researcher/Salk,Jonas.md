> Jonas Edward Salk (born Jonas Salk; October 28, 1914 – June 23, 1995) 
> was an American virologist and medical researcher 
> who developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. 
> 
> He was born in New York City and attended the City College of New York 
> and New York University School of Medicine.
>
> In 1947, Salk accepted a professorship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 
> where he undertook a project beginning in 1948 
> to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. 
> For the next seven years, Salk devoted himself to developing a vaccine against polio.
>
> Salk was immediately hailed as a "miracle worker" 
> when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, 
> and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it 
> in order to maximize its global distribution. 
> 
> The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the University of Pittsburgh 
> looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, 
> their patent attorney said, "If there were any patentable novelty to be found in this phase 
> it would lie within an extremely narrow scope and would be of doubtful value." 
> 
> An immediate rush to vaccinate began in the United States and around the world. 
> Many countries began polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine, 
> including Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium. 
> 
> By 1959, the Salk vaccine had reached about 90 countries. 
> An attenuated live oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin, 
> coming into commercial use in 1961. 
> 
> Less than 25 years after the release of Salk's vaccine, 
> domestic transmission of polio had been eliminated in the United States.
>
> In 1963, Salk founded the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, 
> which is today a center for medical and scientific research. 
> 
> He continued to conduct research and publish books in his later years, 
> focusing in his last years on the search for a vaccine against HIV. 
> 
> Salk campaigned vigorously for mandatory vaccination throughout the rest of his life, 
> calling the universal vaccination of children against disease a "moral commitment". 
> 
> Salk's personal papers are today stored in Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego.
