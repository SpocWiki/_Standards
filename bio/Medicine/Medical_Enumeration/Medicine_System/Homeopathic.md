## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Homeopathy** or homoeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine. 
> It was conceived in 1796 by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. 
> 
> Its practitioners, called homeopaths or homeopathic physicians, believe 
> that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people 
> can cure similar symptoms in sick people; 
> 
> This doctrine is called similia similibus curentur, or "like cures like". 
> Homeopathic preparations are termed remedies and are made using homeopathic dilution. 
> In this process, the selected substance is repeatedly diluted 
> until the final product is chemically indistinguishable from the diluent. 
> Often not even a single molecule of the original substance can be expected 
> to remain in the product. 
> Between each dilution homeopaths may hit and/or shake the product, 
> claiming this makes the diluent "remember" the original substance after its removal. 
> Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.
>
> All relevant scientific knowledge about physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology 
> contradicts homeopathy. 
> Homeopathic remedies are typically biochemically inert, and have no effect on any known disease. 
> Its theory of disease, centered around principles Hahnemann termed miasms, 
> is inconsistent with subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as causes of disease. 
> Clinical trials have been conducted and generally demonstrated 
> no objective effect from homeopathic preparations. 
> 
> The fundamental implausibility of homeopathy as well as a lack of demonstrable effectiveness 
> has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities 
> as quackery and fraud.
>
> Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. 
> It was introduced to the United States in 1825, 
> and the first American homeopathic school opened in 1835. 
> 
> Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions 
> appeared in Europe and the United States. 
> 
> During this period, homeopathy was able to appear relatively successful, 
> as other forms of treatment could be harmful and ineffective. 
> 
> By the end of the century the practice began to wane, 
> with the last exclusively homeopathic medical school in the United States closing in 1920. 
> 
> During the 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback, 
> with sales of some homeopathic products increasing tenfold. 
> The trend corresponded with the rise of the New Age movement, 
> and may be in part due to chemophobia, an irrational aversion to synthetic chemicals, 
> and the longer consultation times homeopathic practitioners provided.
>
> In the 21st century, a series of meta-analyses have 
> shown that the therapeutic claims of homeopathy lack scientific justification. 
> As a result, national and international bodies have 
> recommended the withdrawal of government funding for homeopathy in healthcare. 
> 
> National bodies from Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, 
> as well as the European Academies' Science Advisory Council and the Russian Academy of Sciences 
> have all concluded that homeopathy is ineffective, 
> and recommended against the practice receiving any further funding. 
> 
> The National Health Service in England no longer provides funding for homeopathic remedies 
> and asked the Department of Health to 
> add homeopathic remedies to the list of forbidden prescription items. 
> 
> France removed funding in 2021, while Spain has also announced moves 
> to ban homeopathy and other pseudotherapies from health centers.
