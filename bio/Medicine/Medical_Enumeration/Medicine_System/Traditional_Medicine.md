> Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous medicine or folk medicine) 
> refers to the knowledge, skills, and practices 
> rooted in the cultural beliefs of various societies, especially indigenous groups, 
> used with the intent of treating illness and maintaining health.
>
> In some Asian and African countries, 
> up to 80% of people rely on traditional medicine for primary health care. 
> 
> Traditional medicine includes systems like 
> Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, and Unani. 
> 
> The World Health Organization supports their integration, 
> but warns of potential risks and calls for more research on their safety and effectiveness.
>
> The use of medicinal herbs spans over 5,000 years, 
> beginning with ancient civilizations like the Sumerians, Egyptians, Indians, and Chinese, 
> evolving through Greek, Roman, Islamic, and medieval European traditions, 
> and continuing into colonial America, 
> with beliefs passed down, translated, and expanded across cultures and centuries. 
> 
> Indigenous folk medicine is traditionally passed down orally within communities, 
> often through designated healers like shamans or midwives, 
> and remains practiced based on personal belief, community trust, 
> and perceived effectiveness—even as broader cultural acceptance wanes.
>
> Traditional medicine faces criticism due to absence of scientific evidence 
> and safety concerns from unregulated natural remedies 
> and the use of endangered animals, like slow lorises, sharks, elephants, and pangolins, 
> which contributes to biodiversity loss and illegal wildlife trade.
