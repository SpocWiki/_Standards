> A **Vaccine** is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity 
> to a particular infectious or malignant disease. 
> 
> The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. 
> A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism 
> and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. 
> 
> The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, 
> and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent 
> that it may encounter in the future.
>
> Vaccines can be 
> - prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or "wild" pathogen), 
> - or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). 
> - Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.
>
> The administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are available for twenty-five different preventable infections.
>
> The first recorded use of inoculation to prevent smallpox (see variolation) occurred in the 16th century in China, with the earliest hints of the practice in China coming during the 10th century. It was also the first disease for which a vaccine was produced. The folk practice of inoculation against smallpox was brought from Turkey to Britain in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.
>
> The terms vaccine and vaccination are derived from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner (who both developed the concept of vaccines and created the first vaccine) to denote cowpox. He used the phrase in 1798 for the long title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae Known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed. The science of vaccine development and production is termed vaccinology.
