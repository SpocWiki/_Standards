> Palliative care (from Latin root palliare "to cloak") 
> is an interdisciplinary medical care-giving approach 
> aimed at optimizing quality of life and mitigating or reducing suffering 
> among people with serious, complex, and often terminal illnesses. 
> Many definitions of palliative care exist. 
>
> The World Health Organization (WHO) describes palliative care as:
> [A]n approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Since the 1990s, many palliative care programs involved a disease-specific approach. However, as the field developed throughout the 2000s, the WHO began to take a broader patient-centered approach that suggests that the principles of palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and ultimately fatal illness. This shift was important because if a disease-oriented approach is followed, the needs and preferences of the patient are not fully met and aspects of care, such as pain, quality of life, and social support, as well as spiritual and emotional needs, fail to be addressed. Rather, a patient-centered model prioritizes relief of suffering and tailors care to increase the quality of life for terminally ill patients.

> Palliative care is appropriate for individuals with serious/chronic illnesses across the age spectrum and can be provided as the main goal of care or in tandem with curative treatment. It is ideally provided by interdisciplinary teams which can include physicians, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and dietitians. Palliative care can be provided in a variety of contexts, including but not limited to: hospitals, outpatient clinics, and home settings. Although an important part of end-of-life care, palliative care is not limited to individuals nearing end of life and can be helpful at any stage of a complex or chronic illness.
