## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In a physical examination, medical examination, clinical examination, or medical checkup, 
> a medical practitioner examines a patient for any possible medical signs 
> or symptoms of a medical condition. 
> 
> It generally consists of a series of questions about the patient's medical history 
> followed by an examination based on the reported symptoms. 
> 
> Together, the medical history and the physical examination help to determine a diagnosis 
> and devise the treatment plan. 
> 
> These data then become part of the medical record.
