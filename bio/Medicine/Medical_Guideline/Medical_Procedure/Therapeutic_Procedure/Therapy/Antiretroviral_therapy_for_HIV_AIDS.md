> The management of HIV/AIDS normally includes the use of 
> multiple antiretroviral drugs as a strategy to control HIV infection. 
> 
> There are several classes of antiretroviral agents 
> that act on different stages of the replication cycle of HIV. 
> 
> The use of multiple drugs that act on different viral targets 
> is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). 
> HAART decreases the patient's total burden of HIV, maintains function of the immune system, 
> and prevents opportunistic infections that often lead to death. 
> HAART also **prevents the transmission of HIV** between serodiscordant sex partners 
> so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load.
>
> Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world, 
> HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression to AIDS is increasingly rare. 
> 
> Anthony Fauci, former head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
> has written, "With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, 
> an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach." 
> 
> In the same paper, he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone 
> by antiretroviral therapy. 
> 
> As another commentary noted, "Rather than dealing with acute 
> and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with 
> managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades."
>
> The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization 
> (WHO) recommend offering antiretroviral treatment to all patients with HIV. 
> Because of the complexity of selecting and following a regimen, the potential for side effects, 
> and the importance of taking medications regularly to prevent viral resistance, 
> such organizations emphasize the importance of involving patients in therapy choices 
> and recommend analyzing the risks and the potential benefits.
>
> The WHO has defined health as more than the absence of disease. 
> For this reason, many researchers have dedicated their work 
> to better understanding the effects of HIV-related stigma, 
> the barriers it creates for treatment interventions, 
> and the ways in which those barriers can be circumvented.
