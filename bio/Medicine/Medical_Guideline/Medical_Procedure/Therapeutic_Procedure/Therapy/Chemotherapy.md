> **Chemotherapy** (often abbreviated chemo, sometimes CTX and CTx) 
> is the type of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs 
> (chemotherapeutic agents or alkylating agents) in a standard regimen. 
> 
> Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent 
> (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), 
> or it may aim only to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). 
> Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline 
> specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology.
>
> The term chemotherapy now means the non-specific use of intracellular poisons 
> to inhibit mitosis (cell division) or to induce DNA damage 
> (so that DNA repair can augment chemotherapy). 
> 
> This meaning excludes the more-selective agents that block extracellular signals 
> (signal transduction). 
> 
> Therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-
> promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones 
> (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer), 
> are now called hormonal therapies. 
> Other inhibitions of growth-signals, 
> such as those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases, are targeted therapy.

> The use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy) is systemic therapy for cancer: they are introduced into the blood stream (the system) and therefore can treat cancer anywhere in the body. Systemic therapy is often used with other, local therapy (treatments that work only where they are applied), such as radiation, surgery, and hyperthermia.

> Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells, hence that also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called autoimmunity). These include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis and many others.
