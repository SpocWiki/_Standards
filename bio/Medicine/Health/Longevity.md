## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Longevity** may refer to especially long-lived members of a population, 
> whereas life expectancy is defined statistically as 
> the average number of years remaining at a given age. 
> 
> For example, a population's life expectancy at birth is the same as 
> the average age at death for all people born in the same year (in the case of cohorts).
>
> Longevity studies may involve putative methods to extend life. 
> Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community 
> but also for writers of travel, science fiction, and utopian novels. 
> 
> The legendary fountain of youth appeared in the work of the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus.
>
> There are difficulties in authenticating the longest human life span, 
> owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics. 
> 
> Fiction, legend, and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards, and longevity narratives and unverified longevity claims frequently speak of their existence in the present.
>
> A life annuity is a form of longevity insurance.
