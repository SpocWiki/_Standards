## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, 
> the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities. 
> 
> Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, 
> moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.
>
> Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as 
> the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. 
> 
> However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, 
> physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability 
> to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, 
> to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve immune system function, 
> and to meet emergency situations.
