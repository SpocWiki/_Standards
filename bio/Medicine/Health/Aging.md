## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Ageing (or **aging** in American English) is the process of becoming older. 
> The term refers mainly to humans, many other animals, and fungi, 
> whereas for example, bacteria, perennial plants 
> and some simple animals are potentially biologically immortal (e.g. Polyps). 
> 
> In a broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing, 
> or to the population of a species.
>
> In humans, ageing represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time 
> and can encompass physical, psychological, and social changes. 
> 
> Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while memories and general knowledge typically increase. 
> Ageing is associated with increased risk of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, 
> cardiovascular disease, increased mental health risks, and many more. 
> 
> Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, 
> about two-thirds die from age-related causes. 
> Certain lifestyle choices and socioeconomic conditions have been linked to ageing. 
>
> Current ageing theories are assigned to the damage concept, 
> whereby the accumulation of damage (such as DNA oxidation) may cause biological systems to fail, 
> or to the programmed ageing concept, 
> whereby the internal processes (epigenetic maintenance such as DNA methylation) inherently may cause ageing. 
> Programmed ageing should not be confused with programmed cell death (apoptosis).
