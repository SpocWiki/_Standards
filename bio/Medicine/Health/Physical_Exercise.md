> Exercise or working out is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health. 
> 
> It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, 
> to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, 
> hone athletic skills, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. 
> 
> Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, 
> and improve well-being as well as mental health.
>
> In terms of health benefits, usually, 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for reducing the risk of health problems. At the same time, even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none. Only doing an hour and a quarter (11 minutes/day) of exercise could reduce the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.
