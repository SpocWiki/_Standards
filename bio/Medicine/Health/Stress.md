> **Stress**, whether physiological, biological or psychological, 
> is an organism's response to a stressor, 
> such as an environmental condition or change in life circumstances. 
> 
> When stressed by stimuli that alter an organism's environment, 
> multiple systems respond across the body. 
> 
> In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system 
> and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
> are the two major systems that respond to stress. 
> 
> Two well-known hormones that humans produce during stressful situations 
> are adrenaline and cortisol.
>
> The sympathoadrenal medullary axis (SAM) 
> may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, 
> which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems 
> to acute adaptation to stress, 
> while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis.
>
> The second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, 
> regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions, 
> such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. 
> 
> The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including 
> the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. 
> 
> Through these mechanisms, stress can alter 
> memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism, and susceptibility to diseases.
>
> Disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, 
> whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses.
