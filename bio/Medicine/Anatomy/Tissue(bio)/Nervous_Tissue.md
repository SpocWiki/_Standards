> **nervous tissue**, also called neural tissue, is the main tissue component of the nervous system. 
> The nervous system regulates and controls body functions and activity. 
> 
> It consists of two parts: 
> - the central nervous system (CNS) comprising the brain and spinal cord, and 
> - the peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprising the branching peripheral nerves. 
> 
> It is composed of neurons, also known as nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses to and from it , and neuroglia, also known as glial cells or glia, which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neurons.
>
> Nervous tissue is made up of different types of neurons, all of which have an axon. An axon is the long stem-like part of the cell that sends action potentials to the next cell. Bundles of axons make up the nerves in the PNS and tracts in the CNS.
>
> Functions of the nervous system are sensory input, integration, control of muscles and glands, homeostasis, and mental activity.
