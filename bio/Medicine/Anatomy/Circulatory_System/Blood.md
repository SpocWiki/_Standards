> **Blood** is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates 
> that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, 
> and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.
>
> Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. 
> Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), 
> and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, and hormones. 
> 
> The blood cells are mainly 
> - red blood cells (erythrocytes), 
> - white blood cells (leukocytes), and 
> - (in mammals) platelets (thrombocytes). 
> 
> The most abundant cells are red blood cells. 
> These contain hemoglobin, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to it, increasing its solubility. 
> Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. 
> White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. 
> Platelets are important in the clotting of blood.
>
> Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. 
> In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, 
> and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, 
> from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. 
> Blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated.
>
> Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo-, hemato-, haemo- or haemato- 
> from the Greek word αἷμα (haima) for "blood". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.
