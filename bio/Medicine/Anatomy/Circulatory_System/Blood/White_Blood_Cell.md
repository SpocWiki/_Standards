## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> White blood cells (scientific name leukocytes), also called immune cells or immunocytes, 
> are cells of the immune system that are involved in 
> protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign entities. 
> White blood cells are generally larger than red blood cells. 
> They include three main subtypes: 
> - granulocytes, 
> - lymphocytes and 
> - monocytes.
>
> All white blood cells are produced and derived 
> from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. 
> 
> Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system. 
> All white blood cells have nuclei, which distinguishes them from the other blood cells, 
> the anucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. 
> 
> The different white blood cells are usually classified by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). 
> White blood cells are part of the body's immune system. They help the body fight infection and other diseases. 
> 
> Types of white blood cells are 
> - granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and 
> - agranulocytes (monocytes, and lymphocytes (T cells and B cells)). 
> 
> Myeloid cells (myelocytes) include neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and monocytes. 
> Monocytes are further subdivided into dendritic cells and macrophages. 
> Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils are phagocytic. 
> 
> Lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) include T cells (subdivided into helper T cells, memory T cells, cytotoxic T cells), 
> B cells (subdivided into plasma cells and memory B cells), and natural killer cells. 
> 
> Historically, white blood cells were classified by their physical characteristics (granulocytes and agranulocytes), 
> but this classification system is less frequently used now. 
> Produced in the bone marrow, white blood cells defend the body against infections and disease. 
> An excess of white blood cells is usually due to infection or inflammation. 
> Less commonly, a high white blood cell count could indicate certain blood cancers or bone marrow disorders.
>
> The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of disease, 
> and thus the white blood cell count is an important subset of the complete blood count. 
> The normal white cell count is usually between 4 billion/L and 11 billion/L. 
> 
> In the US, this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. 
> White blood cells make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult, 
> making them substantially less numerous than the red blood cells at 40% to 45%. 
> However, this 1% of the blood makes a huge difference to health because immunity depends on it. 
> 
> An increase in the number of leukocytes over the upper limits is called leukocytosis. 
> It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. 
> It is occasionally abnormal when it is neoplastic or autoimmune in origin. 
> A decrease below the lower limit is called leukopenia, which indicates a weakened immune system.
