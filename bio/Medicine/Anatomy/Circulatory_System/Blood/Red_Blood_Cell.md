## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Red blood cells (RBCs), referred to as erythrocytes (from Ancient Greek  erythros 'red' and  kytos 'hollow vessel', 
> with -cyte translated as 'cell' in modern usage) in academia and medical publishing, 
> also known as red cells, erythroid cells, and rarely haematids, 
> are the most common type of blood cell 
> and the vertebrate's principal means of delivering oxygen (O2) to the body tissues—
> via blood flow through the circulatory system. 
> 
> Erythrocytes take up oxygen in the lungs, or in fish the gills, 
> and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.
>
> The cytoplasm of a red blood cell is rich in hemoglobin (Hb), 
> an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen 
> and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood. 
> 
> Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million hemoglobin molecules. 
> The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, 
> and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function 
> such as deformability and stability of the blood cell while traversing the circulatory system 
> and specifically the capillary network.
>
> In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible biconcave disks. 
> They lack a cell nucleus (which is expelled during development) and organelles, 
> to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; 
> they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. 
> Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults. 
> The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100–120 days in the body 
> before their components are recycled by macrophages.  
> 
> Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute). 
> Approximately 84% of the cells in the human body are the 20–30 trillion red blood cells. 
> Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.
>
> Packed red blood cells are red blood cells that 
> have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion.
