> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. 
> CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: 
> - coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), 
> - heart failure, 
> - hypertensive heart disease, 
> - rheumatic heart disease, 
> - cardiomyopathy, 
> - arrhythmia, 
> - congenital heart disease, 
> - valvular heart disease, 
> - carditis, 
> - aortic aneurysms, 
> - peripheral artery disease, 
> - thromboembolic disease, and 
> - venous thrombosis.
>
> The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. 
> It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths. Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis. This may be caused by high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption,  and poor sleep, among other things. High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6%, and obesity 5%. Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat.
>
> It is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable. Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating, exercise, avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake. Treating risk factors, such as high blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial. Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.
>
> Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females. 
>
> Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In high income countries, the mean age at first cardiovascular disease diagnosis lies around 70 years (73 years in women, 68 years in men). In the United States 11% of people between 20 and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over 80 have CVD. The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80, while it is around 68 in the developing world. 
>
> At same age, men are about 50% more likely to develop CVD and are typically diagnosed seven to ten years earlier in men than in women.
