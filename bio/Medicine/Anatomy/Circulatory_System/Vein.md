## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Vein**s are blood vessels in the circulatory system of humans and most other animals 
> that carry blood towards the heart. 
> Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; 
> exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. 
> In the systemic circulation, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, 
> and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, in the deep veins.
>
> There are three sizes of veins: large, medium, and small. 
> Smaller veins are called venules, and the smallest the post-capillary venules are microscopic 
> that make up the veins of the microcirculation. 
> Veins are often closer to the skin than arteries.
>
> Veins have less smooth muscle and connective tissue and wider internal diameters than arteries. 
> Because of their thinner walls and wider lumens they are able to expand and hold more blood. 
> This greater capacity gives them the term of capacitance vessels. 
> 
> At any time, nearly 70% of the total volume of blood in the human body is in the veins. 
> In medium and large sized veins the flow of blood is maintained 
> by one-way (unidirectional) venous valves to prevent backflow. 
> 
> In the lower limbs this is also aided by muscle pumps, 
> also known as venous pumps that exert pressure on intramuscular veins 
> when they contract and drive blood back to the heart.
