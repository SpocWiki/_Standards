> The sensory nervous system is a part of the nervous system 
> responsible for processing sensory  information.  
> 
> A **Sensory system** consists of sensory neurons (including the sensory receptor cells), neural pathways, 
> and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception and interoception.  
> 
> Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, balance 
> and visceral sensation. 
> 
> Sense organs are transducers that convert data from the outer physical world 
> to the realm of the mind where people interpret the information, 
> creating their perception of the world around them.
>
> The receptive field is the area of the body or environment 
> to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. 
> 
> For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; 
> the light that each rod or cone can see, is its receptive field. 
> 
> Receptive fields have been identified for the visual system, auditory system 
> and somatosensory system.
