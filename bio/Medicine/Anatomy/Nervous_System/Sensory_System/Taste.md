## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The gustatory system or sense of **Taste** 
> is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste. 
> 
> Taste is the perception stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically 
> with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. 
> Taste, along with the sense of smell and trigeminal nerve stimulation 
> (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances. 
> 
> Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas, 
> including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. 
> The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.
>
> The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. 
> Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. 
> The exceptions to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. 
> There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. 
> Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. 
> Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.
>
> Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five basic tastes: 
> - [[Sweetness]], 
> - [[Sourness]], 
> - [[Saltiness]], 
> - [[Bitterness]], and 
> - [[Taste/Savoriness]] (also known as savory or umami). 
> 
> Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another. 
> Taste buds are able to tell different tastes apart when they interact with different molecules or ions. 
> Sweetness, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules 
> to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. 
> 
> Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metals or hydrogen ions meet taste buds, respectively.
>
> The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—
> other factors include 
> - smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; 
> - texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.; 
> - temperature, detected by temperature receptors; and 
> - "coolness" (such as of menthol) and "hotness" (pungency), by chemesthesis.
>
> As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, 
> all basic tastes bring either caution or craving 
> depending upon the effect the things they sense have on the body. 
> Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness warns people of poisons.
>
> Among humans, taste perception begins to fade during ageing, 
> tongue papillae are lost, and saliva production slowly decreases. 
> Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia). 
> 
> Not all mammals share the same tastes: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), 
> cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores, including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, 
> have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five basic tastes.
