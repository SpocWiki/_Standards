## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Umami ( from Japanese: うま味 Japanese pronunciation: [ɯmami]), or **Savoriness**, 
> is one of the five basic tastes. It is characteristic of broths and cooked meats. 
>
> People taste umami through taste receptors that typically respond to glutamates and  nucleotides, 
> which are widely present in meat broths and fermented products. 
> Glutamates are commonly added to some foods in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG), 
> and nucleotides are commonly added in the form of disodium guanylate,  
> inosine monophosphate (IMP) or guanosine monophosphate (GMP). 
> 
> Since umami has its own receptors 
> rather than arising out of a combination of the traditionally recognized taste receptors, 
> scientists now consider umami to be a distinct taste.
>
> Foods that have a strong umami flavor include meats, shellfish, fish (including fish sauce 
> and preserved fish such as Maldives fish, katsuobushi, sardines, and anchovies), dashi, tomatoes, 
> mushrooms, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, meat extract, yeast extract, kimchi, cheeses, and soy sauce.
