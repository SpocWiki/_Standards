> Adipose tissue (also known as body fat or simply fat) is a loose connective tissue 
> composed mostly of adipocytes. 
> It also contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, 
> vascular endothelial cells and a variety of immune cells such as adipose tissue macrophages.     
> Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body.
>
> Previously treated as being hormonally inert, in recent years 
> adipose tissue has been recognized as a major endocrine organ, 
> as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and cytokines (especially TNFα). 
> In obesity, adipose tissue is implicated in the __chronic release of pro-inflammatory markers__ 
> known as adipokines, which are responsible for the development of metabolic syndrome—
> a constellation of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis.
> Especially [[Visceral_Fat]] causes these inflammations. 
>
> Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes 
> and its formation appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. 
> The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy, 
> and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which generates body heat. 
> Adipose tissue—more specifically brown adipose tissue—
> was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.
