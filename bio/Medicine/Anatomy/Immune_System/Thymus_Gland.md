# [[Thymus_Gland]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[WD~Thymus,163987]]

The Thymus generates ca. 5e8 random T-Blood-Cells (hence the T) with arbitrary Antibodies per day, 
from a theoretical set of 1e15, but 98% are eliminated via positive or negative Selection, 
before they are released to the Body. 
Subsequently these T-Cells promulgate via cloning. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Thymus** (pl.: thymuses or thymi) is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. 
> Within the thymus, T cells mature. 
> T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts to specific foreign invaders. 
> The thymus is located in the  upper front part of the chest, 
> in the anterior superior mediastinum, behind the sternum, and in front of the heart. 
> It is made up of two lobes, each consisting of a central medulla and an outer cortex, 
> surrounded by a capsule.
>
> The thymus is made up of immature T cells called thymocytes, 
> as well as lining cells called epithelial cells which help the thymocytes develop. 
> T cells that successfully develop react appropriately with MHC immune receptors of the body 
> (called positive selection) and not against proteins of the body (called negative selection). 
> 
> The thymus is the largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods.  
> By the early teens, the thymus begins to decrease in size and activity 
> and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by fatty tissue.  
> This leads to Immunosenescence.
> 
> Nevertheless, some T cell development continues throughout adult life.
>
> Abnormalities of the thymus can result in a decreased number of T cells and autoimmune diseases 
> such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 and myasthenia gravis. 
> 
> These are often associated with cancer of the tissue of the thymus, called thymoma, 
> or tissues arising from immature lymphocytes such as T cells, called lymphoma. 
> 
> Removal of the thymus is called a thymectomy. 
> 
> Although the thymus has been identified as a part of the body since the time of the Ancient Greeks, 
> it is only since the 1960s that the function of the thymus in the immune system has become clearer.
