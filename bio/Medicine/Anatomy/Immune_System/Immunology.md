## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Immunology** is a branch of biology and medicine that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms.
>
> Immunology charts, measures, and contextualizes 
> the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; 
> malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders 
> (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); 
> and the physical, chemical, and physiological characteristics of the immune system 
> and its components in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. 
> 
> Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in 
> - organ transplantation, 
> - oncology, 
> - rheumatology, 
> - virology, 
> - bacteriology, 
> - parasitology, 
> - psychiatry, and 
> - dermatology.
>
> The term was coined by Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, 
> who advanced studies on immunology and received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1908 
> with Paul Ehrlich "in recognition of their work on immunity". 
> 
> He pinned small thorns into starfish larvae 
> and noticed unusual cells surrounding the thorns. 
> 
> This was the active response of the body trying to maintain its integrity. 
> It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis, 
> in which the body defends itself against a foreign body. 
> 
> Ehrlich accustomed mice to the poisonous ricin and abrin. 
> After feeding them with small but increasing dosages of ricin 
> he ascertained that they had become "ricin-proof". 
> Ehrlich interpreted this as immunization and observed that it was abruptly initiated 
> after a few days and was still in existence after several months.
>
> Prior to the designation of immunity, from the etymological root immunis, 
> which is Latin for 'exempt', early physicians characterized organs 
> that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system. 
> 
> The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the 
> - thymus, bone marrow, and 
> - chief lymphatic tissues such as 
> 	- spleen, 
> 	- tonsils, 
> 	- lymph vessels, 
> 	- lymph nodes, 
> 	- adenoids, and 
> 	- liver. 
> 
> However, many components of the immune system are cellular in nature, 
> and not associated with specific organs, 
> but rather embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body.
