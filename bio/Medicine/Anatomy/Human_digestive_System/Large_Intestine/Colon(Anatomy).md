> The large intestine, also known as the large bowel, 
> is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in tetrapods. 
> 
> Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored in the rectum as feces 
> before being removed by defecation. 
> The colon (progressing from the ascending colon to the transverse, 
> the descending and finally the sigmoid colon) is the longest portion of the large intestine, 
> and the terms "large intestine" and "colon" are often used interchangeably, 
> but most sources define the large intestine as 
> the combination of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal. 
> Some other sources exclude the anal canal.
>
> In humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. It then continues as the colon ascending the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon, and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the  anal canal. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the human gastrointestinal tract.
