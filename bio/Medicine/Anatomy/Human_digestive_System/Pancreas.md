## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Pancreas** (plural pancreases, or pancreata) is an organ of the digestive system 
> and endocrine system of vertebrates. 
> 
> In humans, it is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and functions as a gland. 
> The pancreas is a mixed or heterocrine gland, 
> i.e., it has both an endocrine and a digestive exocrine function. 
> 
> Ninety-nine percent of the pancreas is exocrine and 1% is endocrine. 
> As an endocrine gland, it functions mostly to regulate blood sugar levels, 
> secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. 
> 
> As a part of the digestive system, it functions as an exocrine gland 
> secreting pancreatic juice into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. 
> This juice contains bicarbonate, 
> which neutralizes acid entering the duodenum from the stomach; 
> and digestive enzymes, which break down carbohydrates, proteins and fats in food 
> entering the duodenum from the stomach.
>
> Inflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, 
> with common causes including chronic alcohol use and gallstones. 
> 
> Because of its role in the regulation of blood sugar, 
> the pancreas is also a key organ in diabetes. 
> 
> Pancreatic cancer can arise following chronic pancreatitis or due to other reasons, 
> and carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often only identified after it has spread to other areas of the body.
>
> The word pancreas comes from the Greek πᾶν (pân, "all") & κρέας (kréas, "flesh"). 
> The function of the pancreas in diabetes has been known since at least 1889, 
> with its role in insulin production identified in 1921.
