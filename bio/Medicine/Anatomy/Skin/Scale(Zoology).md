> In zoology, a scale (Ancient Greek: λεπίς, romanized: lepís; Latin: squāma) 
> is a small rigid plate made out of keratin 
> that grows out of vertebrate animals' skin to provide protection. 
> 
> In lepidopterans (butterflies and moths), 
> scales are plates on the surface of the insect wing, 
> made out of chitin instead of keratin, and provide coloration. 
> 
> Scales are quite common 
> and have evolved multiple times through convergent evolution, 
> with varying structure and function.
>
> Scales are generally classified as part of an organism's integumentary system. 
> There are various types of scales according to the shape and class of an animal.
