> A **Cadaver**, often known as a corpse, is a dead human body. 
> Cadavers are used by medical students, physicians and other scientists 
> to study anatomy, identify disease sites, determine causes of death, 
> and provide tissue to repair a defect in a living human being. 
> 
> Students in medical school study and dissect cadavers as a part of their education. 
> Others who study cadavers include archaeologists and arts students. 
> In addition, a cadaver may be used in the development and evaluation of surgical instruments.
>
> The term cadaver is used in courts of law 
> (and, to a lesser extent, also by media outlets such as newspapers) to refer to a dead body, 
> as well as by recovery teams searching for bodies in natural disasters. 
> 
> The word comes from the Latin word cadere ("to fall"). 
> Related terms include cadaverous (resembling a cadaver) 
> and cadaveric spasm (a muscle spasm causing a dead body to twitch or jerk). 
> A cadaver graft (also called “postmortem graft”) is the grafting of tissue from a dead body 
> onto a living human to repair a defect or disfigurement. 
> Cadavers can be observed for their stages of decomposition, 
> helping to determine how long a body has been dead.
>
> Cadavers have been used in art 
> to depict the human body in paintings and drawings more accurately.
