> In biology, tissue is an assembly of similar cells and their extracellular matrix 
> from the same embryonic origin that together carry out a specific function. 
> 
> Tissues occupy a biological organizational level between cells and a complete organ. 
> Accordingly, organs are formed by the functional grouping together of multiple tissues.
> 
> Connective tissue is one of the four primary types of animal tissue, 
> a group of cells that are similar in structure, along with epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. 
> The English word "tissue" derives from the French word "tissu", 
> the past participle of the verb tisser, "to weave".
>
> The study of tissues is known as histology or, in connection with disease, as histopathology. 
> Xavier Bichat is considered as the "Father of Histology". 
> 
> Plant histology is studied in both plant anatomy and physiology. 
> The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block in which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, 
> the  histological stain, and the optical microscope. 
> 
> Developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, 
> and the use of frozen tissue-sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. 
> With these tools, the classical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, 
> enabling considerable refinement of medical diagnosis and prognosis.
