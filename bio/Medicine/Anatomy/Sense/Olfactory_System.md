> The olfactory system is the sensory system used for the sense of smell (olfaction). 
> Olfaction is one of the special senses directly associated with specific organs. 
> 
> Most mammals and reptiles have a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system. 
> The main olfactory system detects airborne substances, 
> while the accessory system senses fluid-phase stimuli.
>
> The senses of smell and taste (gustatory system) are often referred to together 
> as the chemosensory system, 
> because they both give the brain information about the chemical composition of objects 
> through a process called transduction.
