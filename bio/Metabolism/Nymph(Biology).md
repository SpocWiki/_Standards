> In biology, a nymph (from Ancient Greek νύμφα nūmphē meaning "bride") 
> is the juvenile form of some invertebrates, particularly insects, 
> which undergoes gradual metamorphosis (hemimetabolism) before reaching its adult stage.  
> 
> Unlike a typical [[Larva|Larva]], a nymph's overall form already resembles that of the adult, 
> except for a lack of wings (in winged species) and the emergence of genitalia. 
> 
> In addition, while a nymph moults, **it never enters a pupal stage**. 
> Instead, the final moult results in an adult insect. 
> Nymphs undergo multiple stages of development called instars.
