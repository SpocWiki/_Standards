> The **Hayflick limit**, or Hayflick phenomenon, is the 
> number of times a normal somatic, differentiated human cell population will divide 
> before cell division stops.
>
> The concept of the Hayflick limit was advanced by American anatomist Leonard Hayflick 
> in 1961, at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
> 
> Hayflick demonstrated that a normal human fetal cell population 
> will divide between 40 and 60 times in cell culture before entering a senescence phase. 
> This finding refuted the contention by Alexis Carrel that normal cells are immortal.
>
> Hayflick interpreted his discovery to be aging at the cellular level. 
> The aging of cell populations appears to correlate with the overall physical aging of an organism.
>
> Macfarlane Burnet coined the name "Hayflick limit" in his book Intrinsic Mutagenesis: A Genetic Approach to Ageing, published in 1974.
