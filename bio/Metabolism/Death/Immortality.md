> and that this is also a state that the gods at times offer humans. 
> 
> In Christianity, the conviction that God may offer physical immortality 
> with the resurrection of the flesh at the end of time 
> has traditionally been at the center of its beliefs. 
> 
> What form an unending human life would take, 
> or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, 
> has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation and debate. 
> 
> In religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of divinities 
> to human beings who perform virtue or follow divine law.
>
> Some scientists, futurists and philosophers have theorized 
> about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting
