> **burial**, also known as interment or inhumation, is a method of final disposition 
> whereby a dead body is placed into the ground, sometimes with objects. 
> This is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, 
> placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. 
> A funeral is a ceremony that accompanies the final disposition.
>
> Evidence suggests that some archaic and early modern humans buried their dead. 
> Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead. 
> It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure 
> and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones, 
> and in many cultures it has been seen as a necessary step for the deceased to enter the afterlife 
> or to give back to the cycle of life.
>
> Methods of burial may be heavily ritualized and can include natural burial (sometimes called "green burial"); embalming or mummification; and the use of containers for the dead, such as shrouds, coffins, grave liners, and burial vaults, all of which can slow decomposition of the body. Sometimes objects or grave goods are buried with the body, which may be dressed in fancy or ceremonial garb. Depending on the culture, the manner in which the body is positioned may have great significance.
>
> The location of the burial may be determined by taking into account concerns surrounding health and sanitation, religious concerns, and cultural practices. Some cultures keep the dead close to provide guidance to the living, while others "banish" them by locating burial grounds at a distance from inhabited areas. Some religions consecrate special ground to bury the dead, and some families build private family cemeteries.
>
> Most modern cultures document the location of graves with headstones, which may be inscribed with information and tributes to the deceased. However, some people are buried in anonymous or secret graves for various reasons. Sometimes multiple bodies are buried in a single grave either by choice (as in the case of married couples), due to space concerns, or in the case of mass graves as a way to deal with many bodies at once.
>
> Alternatives to burial include cremation (and subsequent interment), burial at sea and cryopreservation. Some human cultures may bury the remains of beloved animals.
