> A **Grave** is a location where a dead body 
> (typically that of a human, although sometimes that of an animal) 
> is buried or interred after a funeral. 
> Graves are usually located in special areas set aside for the purpose of burial, such as graveyards or cemeteries.
>
> In some religions, it is believed 
> that the body must be burned or cremated for the soul to survive; 
> in others, the complete decomposition of the body 
> is considered to be important for the rest of the soul (see bereavement).
