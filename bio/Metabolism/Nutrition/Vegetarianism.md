## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Vegetarianism** is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat 
> (red meat, poultry, seafood, freshwater fish, insects, and the flesh of any other animal). 
> It may also include abstaining from eating all by-products of animal slaughter. 
> A person who practices vegetarianism is known as a vegetarian.
>
> Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. 
> Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient animal life. 
> Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs 
> as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, taste-related, or relate to other personal preferences.
>
> A small number of towns and cities around the world are exclusively vegetarian or have outlawed meat, including Rishikesh in India, which banned meat, fish, and eggs in 1956. A larger number of towns and cities are vegetarian-friendly. In other locations, finding vegetarian food can pose some difficulties.
>
> There are many variations of the vegetarian diet: a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs, and a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet includes both. All of them include honey. As the strictest of vegetarian diets, a vegan diet excludes all animal products, and can be accompanied by the abstention from animal-derived products, such as leather shoes and silk clothes.
>
> Vegetarian diets pose some difficulties. For vitamin B12, depending on the presence or absence of eggs and dairy products in the diet or other reliable B12 sources, vegetarians may incur a nutritional deficiency. Packaged and processed foods may contain minor quantities of animal ingredients. While some vegetarians scrutinize product labels for such ingredients, others do not object to consuming them, or are unaware of their presence.
