> A **Saturated fat** is a type of fat: a glyceride in which the fatty acid chains have all single bonds between the carbon atoms (i.e. an alkane). Glyceride fats with single bonds are called saturated because they are "saturated with" hydrogen atoms, having no double bonds available to react with more hydrogen. 
>
> Saturated fats are generally solid at room temperature. All fats, both saturated and unsaturated, contain 9kcal per gram, making them more energy dense than both proteins and carbohydrates. 
>
> Most  animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated. Various foods contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated. Many processed foods, like foods deep-fried in hydrogenated oil and sausages, are high in saturated fat content. Some store-bought baked goods are as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils. Other examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol include animal fat products such as lard or schmaltz, fatty meats and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter. Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. 
>
> Guidelines released by many medical organizations, including the World Health Organization, have advocated for reduction in the intake of saturated fat to promote health and reduce the risk from cardiovascular diseases.
