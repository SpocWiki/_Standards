> **Oil** is **any nonpolar chemical substance** that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons 
> and is hydrophobic (does not mix with water) and lipophilic (mixes with other oils). 
> 
> Oils are usually flammable and surface active. 
> Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
>
> The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds 
> that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses. 
> 
> Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile. 
> They are used for 
> - food (e.g., olive oil), 
> - fuel (e.g., heating oil), 
> - medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), 
> - lubrication (e.g. motor oil), and 
> - the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials. 
> 
> Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
