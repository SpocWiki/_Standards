## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> In chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, a fatty acid is a [[Carboxylic_Acid]] 
> with an [[Aliphatic_Chain]], which is either saturated or unsaturated. 
> 
> Most naturally occurring fatty acids have an unbranched chain of an even number of carbon atoms, 
> from 4 to 28. 
> 
> Fatty acids are a major component of the lipids (up to 70% weight) in some species such as microalgae 
> but in some other organisms are not found in their standalone form, 
> but instead exist as three main classes of esters: [[Triglyceride]]s, [[Phospholipid]]s, and cholesteryl esters. 
> 
> In any of these forms, fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals 
> and important structural components for cells.
