> Trans fat is a type of unsaturated fat that occurs in foods. 
> Small amounts of trans fats occur naturally, 
> but large amounts are found in some processed foods made with partially hydrogenated oils. 
> 
> Because consumption of trans fats is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, 
> artificial trans fats are highly regulated or banned in many countries. 
> 
> However, they are still widely consumed in developing nations 
> where they are associated with increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and death.
>
> In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that 
> artificial trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils were not generally recognized as safe (GRAS), 
> and the use of such oils and trans fats should be limited or eliminated from manufactured foods. 
> 
> Numerous governing bodies followed, including the 
> European Union, Canada, and Australia/New Zealand, 
> with restrictions or **bans on the use of partially hydrogenated oils and trans fats in food**.  
> 
> The World Health Organization (WHO) had set a 
> goal to make the world free from industrially produced trans fat by the end of 2023. 
> The goal was not met, and the WHO announced 
> another goal in 2024 "for accelerated action until 2025 to complete this effort".
>
> Trans fatty acids (also called trans-unsaturated fatty acids) are derived from trans fats, 
> which are triglycerides (esters of glycerin).  
> Trans fats are converted to trans fatty acids in the digestive tract prior to absorption.
