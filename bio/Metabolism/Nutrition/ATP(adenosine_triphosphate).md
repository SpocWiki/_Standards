> Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleoside triphosphate 
> that provides energy of approximate 30.5kJ/mol 
> to drive and support many processes in living cells, such as 
> - muscle contraction, 
> - nerve impulse propagation, and 
> - chemical synthesis. 
> 
> Found in all known forms of life, it is often referred to as the 
> "molecular unit of currency" for intracellular energy transfer.
> 
> When consumed in a metabolic process, ATP converts 
> - either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
> - or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). 
> 
> Other processes regenerate ATP. 
> 
> It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme. 
> An average adult human processes around 50 kilograms (about 100 moles) daily.
> 
> From the perspective of biochemistry, 
> ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, 
> which indicates that it consists of three components: 
> - a nitrogenous base (adenine), 
> - the sugar ribose, and 
> - the triphosphate.
