To maximize creatine phosphate “resorption” — more accurately, intracellular retention and turnover — combine:

- Adequate dietary or supplemental creatine (3–5 g·day⁻¹).
- Co-ingestion with carbohydrates or carbohydrate + protein blends.
- Regular high-intensity or resistance training.
- Adequate rest for phosphocreatine resynthesis during exercise sessions.

When these approaches are implemented, phosphocreatine levels can increase by **up to 40 %**, thereby enhancing muscular energy buffering and overall performance.
