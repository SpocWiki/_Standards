# [[Carbohydrate]] 


The different levels of carbohydrates are classified based on their complexity and structure.

> A **carbohydrate** is a biomolecule composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms. The typical hydrogen-to-oxygen atomic ratio is 2:1, analogous to that of water, and is represented by the empirical formula Cm(H2O)n (where m and n may differ). This formula does not imply direct covalent bonding between hydrogen and oxygen atoms; for example, in CH2O, hydrogen is covalently bonded to carbon, not oxygen. While the 2:1 hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio is characteristic of many carbohydrates, exceptions exist. For instance, uronic acids and deoxy-sugars like fucose deviate from this precise stoichiometric definition. Conversely, some compounds conforming to this definition, such as formaldehyde and acetic acid, are not classified as carbohydrates.
>
> The term is predominantly used in biochemistry, functioning as a synonym for saccharide (from Ancient Greek  σάκχαρον (sákkharon) 'sugar'), a group that includes sugars, starch, and cellulose. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars. While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose, which was originally taken from the word glucose (from Ancient Greek  γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must'), and is used for almost all sugars (e.g., fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose (cane or beet sugar), ribose, lactose (milk sugar)).
>
> Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve as an energy store (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g., cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods and fungi). The 5-carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes (e.g., ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.
>
> Carbohydrates are central to nutrition and are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide and is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal flour, such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from sugarcane or sugar beets), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in honey, many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey is often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.
>
> Cellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble dietary fiber. Although it is not digestible by humans, cellulose and insoluble dietary fiber generally help maintain a healthy digestive system by facilitating bowel movements. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include resistant starch and inulin, which feed some bacteria in the microbiota of the large intestine, and are metabolized by these bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids.

## Simple Carbohydrates

### **Monosaccharides**

These are the simplest form of carbohydrates, consisting of a single sugar unit. Examples include:

- [[Carbohydrate/Monosaccharide/Glucose]] 
- [[Carbohydrate/Monosaccharide/Fructose]] 
- [[Carbohydrate/Monosaccharide/Galactose]] 

### **Disaccharides**

These are carbohydrates composed of two monosaccharide molecules linked together. Examples include:

- [[Carbohydrate/Sugar]] (glucose + fructose)
- [[Carbohydrate/Disaccharide/Lactose]] (glucose + galactose)
- [[Carbohydrate/Disaccharide/Maltose]] (glucose + glucose)


## Complex Carbohydrates

### **Oligosaccharides**

These are carbohydrates composed of 3–10 sugar units. 
They are commonly found in foods such as beans and lentils. Examples include:

- [[Carbohydrate/Oligosaccharide/Raffinose]] (galactose + glucose + fructose)
- [[Carbohydrate/Oligosaccharide/Stachyose]]

### **Polysaccharides**

These are long chains of monosaccharide units and are classified into two types based on their biological role:

#### **Storage Polysaccharides**

- [[Carbohydrate/Polysaccharide/Starch]]: A storage carbohydrate in plants, composed of amylose and amylopectin.
- [[Carbohydrate/Polysaccharide/Glycogen]]: A storage carbohydrate in animals, stored in liver and muscle cells.

#### **Structural Polysaccharides**

- [[Carbohydrate/Polysaccharide/Cellulose]]: A primary component of plant cell walls, not digestible by humans.
- [[Carbohydrate/Polysaccharide/Chitin]]: Found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and fungal cell walls.
