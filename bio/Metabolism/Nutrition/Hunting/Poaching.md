## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Poaching** is the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals, 
> usually associated with land use rights.
>
> Poaching was once performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes 
> and to supplement meager diets. 
> It was set against the hunting privileges of nobility and territorial rulers.
>
> Since the 1980s, the term "poaching" has also been used 
> to refer to the illegal harvesting of wild plants. 
> 
> In agricultural terms, the term 'poaching' is also applied to the loss of soils or grass 
> by the damaging action of feet of livestock, which can affect availability of productive land, 
> water pollution through increased runoff and welfare issues for cattle. 
> Stealing livestock, as in cattle raiding, classifies as theft rather than poaching.
>
> The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 15 
> enshrines the sustainable use of all wildlife. 
> 
> It targets the taking of action on dealing with poaching 
> and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna 
> to ensure their availability for present and future generations.
