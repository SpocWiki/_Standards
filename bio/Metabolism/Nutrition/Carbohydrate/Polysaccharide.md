> **Polysaccharide**s, or polycarbohydrates, are the most abundant carbohydrates found in food. 
> They are long-chain polymeric carbohydrates composed of 
> [[Monosaccharide]] units bound together by glycosidic linkages. 
> 
> This carbohydrate can react with water (hydrolysis) using amylase enzymes as catalyst, 
> which produces constituent sugars (monosaccharides or oligosaccharides). 
> They range in structure from linear to highly branched. 
> 
> Examples include storage polysaccharides such as [[Polysaccharide/Starch]], [[Polysaccharide/Glycogen]] and [[galactogen]] 
> and structural polysaccharides such as hemicellulose and [[Polysaccharide/Chitin]].
>
> Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, 
> containing slight modifications of the repeating unit. 
> Depending on the structure, these macromolecules can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building blocks. They may be amorphous or even insoluble in water.
>
> 
>
> When all the monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are the same type, the polysaccharide is called a homopolysaccharide or homoglycan, but when more than one type of monosaccharide is present, it is called a heteropolysaccharide or heteroglycan.

> Natural saccharides are generally composed of simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides with general formula (CH2O)n where n is three or more. Examples of monosaccharides are glucose, fructose, and glyceraldehyde. Polysaccharides, meanwhile, have a general formula of Cx(H2O)y where x and y are usually large numbers between 200 and 2500. When the repeating units in the polymer backbone are six-carbon monosaccharides, as is often the case,  the general formula simplifies to  (C6H10O5)n, where typically 40 ≤ n ≤ 3000.
>
> As a rule of thumb, polysaccharides contain more than ten monosaccharide units, whereas oligosaccharides contain three to ten monosaccharide units, but the precise cutoff varies somewhat according to the convention. Polysaccharides are an important class of biological polymers. Their function in living organisms is usually either structure- or storage-related. [[Polysaccharide/Starch]] (a polymer of glucose) is used as a storage polysaccharide in plants, being found in the form of both amylose and the branched amylopectin. In animals, the structurally similar glucose polymer is the more densely branched [[Polysaccharide/Glycogen]], sometimes called "animal starch". Glycogen's properties allow it to be metabolized more quickly, which suits the active lives of moving animals. In bacteria, they play an important role in bacterial multicellularity.
>
> [[Polysaccharide/Cellulose]] and [[Polysaccharide/Chitin]] are examples of structural polysaccharides. [[Polysaccharide/Cellulose]] is used in the cell walls of plants and other organisms and is said to be the most abundant organic molecule on Earth. It has many uses such as a significant role in the paper and textile industries and is used as a feedstock for the production of rayon (via the viscose process), [[Polysaccharide/Cellulose]] acetate, celluloid, and nitrocellulose. [[Polysaccharide/Chitin]] has a similar structure but has nitrogen-containing side branches, increasing its strength. It is found in arthropod exoskeletons and in the cell walls of some fungi. It also has multiple uses, including surgical threads. Polysaccharides also include callose or laminarin, chrysolaminarin, xylan, arabinoxylan, mannan, fucoidan, and galactomannan.
