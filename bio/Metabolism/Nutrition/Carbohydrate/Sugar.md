## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Sugar** is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. 
> 
> Specifically it refers to [[Disaccharide/Sucrose]], a [[Disaccharide]], 
> is a sugar composed of [[Monosaccharide/Glucose|glucose]] and [[Monosaccharide/Fructose|fructose]] subunits. 
> It is produced naturally in plants and is the main constituent of white sugar. 
> It has the molecular formula C12H22O11.
>
> For human consumption, sucrose is extracted and refined from either sugarcane or sugar beet. 
> 
> Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. 
> Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, 
> are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; 
> common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), 
> and maltose (two molecules of glucose). 
> White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. 
> In the body, compound sugars are hydrolyzed into simple sugars.
>
> Longer chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars and 
> are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. 
> Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. 
> Some other chemical substances, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol and sugar alcohols, 
> may have a sweet taste but are not classified as sugar.
>
> Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants. 
> Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. 
> Sucrose is especially concentrated in [[sugarcane]] a[[../../../bio~Domain/Eukarya/Plant/Land_Plant/Seed_Plant/Flowering_Plant/Eudicots/Core_Eudicots/Caryophyllales/Amaranth/Betoideae/Sugar_Beet]]], 
> making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. 
> 
> In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. 
> Maltose may be produced by malting grain. 
> 
> Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. 
> It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. 
> A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, 
> industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.
>
> Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), 
> is sometimes added to commercially available ultra-processed food and beverages, 
> and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). 
> 
> The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year, 
> with North and South Americans consuming up to 50 kg (110 lb) and Africans consuming under 20 kg (44 lb).
>
> In 2015, the World Health Organization strongly recommended 
> that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake, 
> and encouraged a reduction to below 5%. 
> 
> Sucrose is particularly dangerous as a risk factor for tooth decay, 
> because Streptococcus mutans bacteria convert it into a sticky, extracellular, dextran-based [[Polysaccharide]] 
> that allows them to cohere, forming plaque. 
> Sucrose is the only sugar that bacteria can use to form this sticky [[Polysaccharide]].
>
> In general, high sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefit, 
> and is associated with a risk of cardiometabolic and other health detriments.
>



> Sugar mills – typically located in tropical regions near where sugarcane is grown – 
> crush the cane and produce raw sugar which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose. 
> 
> Sugar beet factories are located in temperate climates where the beet is grown, 
> and process the beets directly into refined sugar. 
> 
> The sugar-refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals before dissolving them into a sugar syrup 
> which is filtered and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour. 
> The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum 
> and crystallized as the final purification process 
> to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.
>
> Sugar is often an added ingredient in food production and recipes. 
> About 185 million tonnes of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017.
