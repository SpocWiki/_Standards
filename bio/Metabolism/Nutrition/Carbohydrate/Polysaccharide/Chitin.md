> **Chitin** (C8H13O5N)n ( KY-tin) is a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, 
> an amide derivative of glucose. 
> 
> Chitin is the __second most abundant polysaccharide__ in nature (behind only cellulose); 
> an estimated 1 billion tons of chitin are produced each year in the biosphere. 
> 
> It is a primary component of cell walls in fungi (especially filamentous and mushroom-forming fungi), 
> the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae, cephalopod beaks 
> and gladii of molluscs and in some nematodes and diatoms.
>
> It is also synthesized by at least some fish and lissamphibians. 
> 
> Commercially, chitin is extracted from the shells of crabs, shrimps, shellfish and lobsters, 
> which are major __by-products of the seafood industry__. 
> 
> The structure of chitin is comparable to cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. 
> It is functionally comparable to the protein [[Keratin]]. 
> 
> Chitin has proved useful for several medicinal, industrial and biotechnological purposes.
