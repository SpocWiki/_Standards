> **Galactose** (, galacto- + -ose, "milk sugar"), sometimes abbreviated Gal, 
> is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 65% as sweet as sucrose. 
> 
> It is an aldohexose and a C-4 epimer of glucose. 
> A galactose molecule linked with a glucose molecule forms a lactose molecule.
>
> Galactan is a polymeric form of galactose found in hemicellulose, 
> and forming the core of the galactans, a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates.
>
> D-Galactose is also known as brain sugar, 
> since it is a component of glycoproteins (oligosaccharide-protein compounds) found in nerve tissue.
