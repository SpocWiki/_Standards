> **Fructose**, or fruit sugar, is a ketonic simple sugar found in many plants, 
> where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. 
> 
> It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, 
> that are absorbed by the gut directly into the blood of the portal vein during digestion. 
> The liver then converts most fructose and galactose into glucose 
> for distribution in the bloodstream or deposition into glycogen. 
>
> Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. 
> The name "fructose" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller. 
> Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. 
> Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.
>
> Commercially, fructose is derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and [[../Maize]]. 
> High-fructose corn syrup is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. 
> 
> Sucrose is a compound with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. 
> All forms of fructose, including those found in fruits and juices, 
> are commonly added to foods and drinks for palatability and taste enhancement, 
> and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. 
> As of 2004, about 240,000 tons of crystalline fructose were being produced annually.
>
> Excessive consumption of sugars, including fructose, (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) 
> may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, 
> leading to metabolic syndrome. 
> 
> The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated in 2011 
> that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages 
> because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels, 
> while also noting the potential downside that "high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications 
> such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity". 
> 
> The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the 
> claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, 
> stating that "there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake, 
> at levels consumed in the normal UK diet, leads to adverse health outcomes 
> independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars."
