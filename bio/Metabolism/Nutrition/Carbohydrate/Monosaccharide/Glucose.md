> **Glucose** is a Monosaccharide sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6. 
> 
> It is overall the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. 
> 
> It is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, 
> using energy from sunlight. 
> 
> It is used by plants to make cellulose, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world, for use in cell walls, 
> and by all living organisms to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.
>
> In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. 
> 
> Glucose for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as amylose and amylopectin, 
> and in animals as glycogen. 
> 
> Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. 
> 
> The naturally occurring form is d-glucose, 
> while its stereoisomer l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts 
> and is less biologically active. 
> 
> Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. 
> The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. 
> Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. 
> In animals, it is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis.
>
> Glucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. 
> It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride (table salt).
>
> The name glucose is derived from Ancient Greek γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must', from γλυκύς (glykýs) 'sweet'. 
> The suffix -ose is a chemical classifier denoting a sugar.
