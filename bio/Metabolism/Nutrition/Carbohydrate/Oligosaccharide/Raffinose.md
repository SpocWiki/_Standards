> **Raffinose** is a trisaccharide composed of galactose, glucose, and fructose. 
> 
> It can be found in beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, other vegetables, and whole grains. 
> 
> Raffinose can be hydrolyzed to D-galactose and sucrose by the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL), 
> an enzyme synthesized by bacteria found in the large intestine. 
> 
> α-GAL also hydrolyzes other α-galactosides such as stachyose, verbascose, and galactinol, if present. 
> 
> In plants, raffinose plays a significant role in stress responses, 
> particularly temperature sensitivity, seed vigour, resistance to pathogens, and desiccation.
