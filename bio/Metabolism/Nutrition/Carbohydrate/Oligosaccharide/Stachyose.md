> **Stachyose** is a tetrasaccharide 
> consisting of two α-D-galactose units, one α-D-glucose unit, and one β-D-fructose unit 
> sequentially linked as Gal(α1→6)Gal(α1→6)Glc(α1↔2β)Fruf. 
> 
> Together with related oligosaccharides such as raffinose, 
> stachyose occurs naturally in numerous vegetables (e.g. green beans, soybeans and other beans) and other plants.  
>
> Stachyose is less sweet than sucrose, at about 28% on a weight basis. 
> 
> It is mainly used as a bulk sweetener or for its functional oligosaccharide properties. 
> Stachyose is not completely digestible by humans and delivers 1.5 to 2.4 kcal/g (6 to 10 kJ/g).
