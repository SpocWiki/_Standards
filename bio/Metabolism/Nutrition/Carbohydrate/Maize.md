> **Maize**  (Zea mays), also known as corn in North American English, 
> is a tall stout grass that produces cereal grain. 
> 
> It was domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago from wild teosinte. 
> Native Americans planted it alongside beans and squashes in the Three Sisters polyculture. 
> 
> The leafy stalk of the plant gives rise to male inflorescences or tassels which produce pollen, 
> and female inflorescences called ears. 
> 
> The ears yield grain, known as kernels or seeds. 
> In modern commercial varieties, these are usually yellow or white; other varieties can be of many colors. 
>
> Maize relies on humans for its propagation. 
> Since the [[../../../../../_private/bio/Medicine/Health/Ernährung/Columbian_Exchange]], it has become a staple food in many parts of the world, 
> with the total production of maize surpassing that of wheat and rice. 
> 
> Much maize is used for animal feed, whether as grain or as the whole plant, 
> which can either be baled or made into the more palatable silage. 
> 
> Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are grown for human consumption, 
> while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, for uses such as 
> - cornmeal or masa, 
> - corn starch, 
> - corn syrup, 
> - pressing into corn oil, 
> - alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey, and as 
> - chemical feedstocks including ethanol and other biofuels.
>
> Maize is cultivated throughout the world; 
> a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain. 
> In 2020, world production was 1.1 billion tonnes. 
> 
> It is afflicted by many pests and diseases; 
> two major insect pests, European corn borer and corn rootworms, 
> have each caused annual losses of a billion dollars in the US. 
> 
> Modern plant breeding has greatly increased output and qualities such as 
> nutrition, drought tolerance, and tolerance of pests and diseases. 
> Much maize is now genetically modified. 
>
> As a food, maize is used to make a wide variety of dishes including 
> Mexican tortillas and tamales, Italian polenta, and American hominy grits. 
> 
> Maize protein is low in some essential amino acids, 
> and the niacin it contains only becomes available if freed by alkali treatment. 
> In Mesoamerica, maize is deified as a maize god and depicted in sculptures.
