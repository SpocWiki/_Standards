> **Monosaccharide**s (from Greek monos: single, sacchar: sugar), also called simple sugars, 
> are the simplest forms of sugar and the most basic units (monomers) 
> from which all carbohydrates are built. 
> 
> Chemically, monosaccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes with the formula H-[CHOH]n-CHO 
> or polyhydroxy ketones with the formula H-[CHOH]m-CO-[CHOH]n-H 
> with three or more carbon atoms.
>
> They are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline organic solids. 
> Contrary to their name (sugars), only some monosaccharides have a sweet taste. 
> Most monosaccharides have the formula (CH2O)x 
> (though not all molecules with this formula are monosaccharides).
>
> Examples of monosaccharides include glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose), and galactose. 
> Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides (such as sucrose, lactose and maltose) 
> and polysaccharides (such as cellulose and starch). 
> The table sugar used in everyday vernacular is itself a disaccharide sucrose 
> comprising one molecule of each of the two monosaccharides D-glucose and D-fructose.
>
> Each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group is chiral, except those at the end of the chain. 
> This gives rise to a number of isomeric forms, all with the same chemical formula. 
> For instance, galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses, 
> but have different physical structures and chemical properties.
>
> The monosaccharide glucose plays a pivotal role in metabolism, 
> where the chemical energy is extracted through glycolysis 
> and the citric acid cycle to provide energy to living organisms.  
> Maltose is the dehydration condensate of two glucose molecules.
