> **Maltose** ( or ), also known as maltobiose or malt sugar, is a disaccharide 
> formed from two units of glucose joined with an α(1→4) bond. 
> 
> In the isomer isomaltose, the two glucose molecules are joined with an α(1→6) bond. 
> 
> Maltose is the two-unit member of the amylose homologous series, 
> the key structural motif of starch. 
> 
> When beta-amylase breaks down starch, 
> it removes two glucose units at a time, producing maltose. 
> 
> An example of this reaction is found in germinating seeds, 
> which is why it was named after malt. 
> Unlike sucrose, it is a reducing sugar.
