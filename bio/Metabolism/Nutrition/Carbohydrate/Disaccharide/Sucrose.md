> **sucrose**, a disaccharide, is a sugar composed of [[../Monosaccharide/Glucose]] and [[../Monosaccharide/Fructose]] subunits. 
> It is produced naturally in plants and is the main constituent of white sugar. 
> It has the molecular formula C12H22O11.
>
> For human consumption, sucrose is extracted and refined from either [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]. 
> Sugar mills – typically located in tropical regions near where sugarcane is grown – 
> crush the cane and produce raw sugar 
> which is shipped to other factories for refining into pure sucrose. 
> 
> Sugar beet factories are located in temperate climates where the beet is grown, 
> and process the beets directly into refined sugar. 
> 
> The sugar-refining process involves washing the raw sugar crystals 
> before dissolving them into a sugar syrup which is filtered 
> and then passed over carbon to remove any residual colour. 
> 
> The sugar syrup is then concentrated by boiling under a vacuum 
> and crystallized as the final purification process 
> to produce crystals of pure sucrose that are clear, odorless, and sweet.
>
> Sugar is often an added ingredient in food production and recipes. 
> About 185 million tonnes of sugar were produced worldwide in 2017.
>
> Sucrose is particularly dangerous as a risk factor for tooth decay 
> because Streptococcus mutans bacteria convert it into a sticky, extracellular, 
> dextran-based polysaccharide that allows them to cohere, forming plaque. 
> Sucrose is the only sugar that bacteria can use to form this sticky polysaccharide.
