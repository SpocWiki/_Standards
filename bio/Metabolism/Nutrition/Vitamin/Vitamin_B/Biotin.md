## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Biotin** (also known as vitamin B7) is one of the B vitamins – a group of essential dietary micronutrients. Present in every living cell, it is involved as a cofactor for enzymes in numerous metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the biochemistry of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids.
>
> When isolated, biotin is a white, needle-like crystalline solid. Biotin is obtained from foods, particularly meats and liver, and is sold as a dietary supplement.
>
> The name biotin, borrowed from the German biotin, derives from the Ancient Greek word βίοτος (bíotos; 'life') and the suffix "-in" (a suffix used in chemistry usually to indicate 'forming').
