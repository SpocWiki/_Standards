> Thiamine deficiency is a medical condition of low levels of thiamine (vitamin B1). 
> A severe and chronic form is known as beriberi. 
> The name beriberi was possibly borrowed in the 18th century from the Sinhalese phrase බැරි බැරි 
> (bæri bæri, “I cannot, I cannot”), owing to the weakness caused by the condition. 
> 
> The two main types in adults are wet beriberi and dry beriberi. 
> Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system, resulting in a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, 
> and leg swelling. 
> Dry beriberi affects the nervous system, resulting in numbness of the hands and feet, 
> confusion, trouble moving the legs, and pain. 
> A form with loss of appetite and constipation may also occur. 
> Another type, acute beriberi, found mostly in babies, presents with loss of appetite, 
> vomiting, lactic acidosis, changes in heart rate, and enlargement of the heart.
>
> Risk factors include a diet of mostly white rice, alcoholism, dialysis, chronic diarrhea, 
> and taking high doses of diuretics. 
> In rare cases, it may be due to a genetic condition 
> that results in difficulties absorbing thiamine found in food. 
> Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are forms of dry beriberi. 
> Diagnosis is based on symptoms, low levels of thiamine in the urine, high blood lactate, 
> and improvement with thiamine supplementation.
>
> Treatment is by thiamine supplementation, either by mouth or by injection. 
> With treatment, symptoms generally resolve in a few weeks. 
> The disease may be prevented at the population level through the fortification of food.
>
> Thiamine deficiency is rare in the United States. It remains relatively common in sub-Saharan Africa. 
> Outbreaks have been seen in refugee camps. 
> Thiamine deficiency has been described for thousands of years in Asia, 
> and became more common in the late 1800s with the increased __processing of rice__.
