> Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate) is a water-soluble vitamin found in citrus and other fruits, berries and vegetables. 
> It is also a generic prescription medication and in some countries is sold as a non-prescription dietary supplement. 
> As a therapy, it is used to prevent and treat scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.
>
> Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue, the formation of collagen, and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. 
> It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function. 
> It also functions as an antioxidant. 
> 
> Vitamin C may be taken by mouth or by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous injection. 
> 
> Various health claims exist on the basis that moderate vitamin C deficiency increases disease risk, such as for the common cold, cancer or COVID-19. 
> There are also claims of benefits from vitamin C supplementation in excess of the recommended dietary intake for people who are not considered vitamin C deficient. 
> Vitamin C is generally well tolerated. 
> Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, trouble sleeping, and flushing of the skin. 
> The United States National Academy of Medicine recommends against consuming large amounts.:  
>
> Most animals are able to synthesize their own vitamin C. 
> However, apes (including humans) and monkeys (but not all primates), most bats, most fish, some rodents, and certain other animals 
> must acquire it from dietary sources because a gene for a synthesis enzyme has mutations that render it dysfunctional.
>
> Vitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928, and in 1933, was the first vitamin to be chemically produced. 
> Partly for its discovery, Albert Szent-Györgyi was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
