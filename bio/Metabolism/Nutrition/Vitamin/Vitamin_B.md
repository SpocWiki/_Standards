# [[Vitamin_B]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> B vitamins are a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism and synthesis of red blood cells. They are a chemically diverse class of compounds.
>
> Dietary supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamins are referred to by B-number or by chemical name, such as B1 for thiamine, B2 for riboflavin, and B3 for niacin, while some are more commonly recognized by name than by number, such as pantothenic acid (B5), biotin (B7), and folate (B9). B vitamins are present in protein-rich foods, such as fish, poultry, meat, dairy products, and eggs; they are also found in leafy green vegetables, beans, and peas. Fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals, baked products, and infant formulas, may contain B vitamins.
>
> Each B vitamin is either a cofactor (generally a coenzyme) for key metabolic processes or is a precursor needed to make one.
