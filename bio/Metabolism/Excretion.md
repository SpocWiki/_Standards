> **Excretion** is elimination of metabolic waste, which is an essential process in all organisms. 
> In vertebrates, this is primarily carried out by the lungs, kidneys, and skin. 
> 
> This is in contrast with [[Secretion]], where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell. 
> For example, placental mammals expel urine from the bladder through the urethra, 
> which is part of the excretory system. 
> Unicellular organisms discharge waste products directly through the surface of the cell.
>
> During life activities such as cellular respiration, several chemical reactions take place in the body. 
> These are known as metabolism. These chemical reactions produce waste products 
> such as carbon dioxide, water, salts, urea and uric acid. 
> 
> Accumulation of these wastes beyond a level inside the body is harmful to the body. 
> The excretory organs remove these wastes. 
> This process of removal of metabolic waste from the body is known as excretion.
