## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Herbivore** is an animal anatomically and physiologically evolved to feed on plants, 
> especially upon vascular tissues such as foliage, fruits or seeds, 
> as the main component of its diet. 
> 
> These more broadly also encompass animals that eat non-vascular autotrophs 
> such as mosses, algae and lichens, 
> but do not include those feeding on decomposed plant matters (i.e. detritivores) 
> or macrofungi (i.e. fungivores).
>
> As a result of their plant-based diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouth structures 
> (jaws or mouthparts) well adapted to mechanically break down plant materials, 
> and their digestive systems have special enzymes (e.g. amylase and cellulase) 
> to digest polysaccharides. 
> 
> Grazing herbivores such as horses and cattles have wide flat-crowned teeth 
> that are better adapted for grinding grass, tree bark 
> and other tougher lignin-containing materials, 
> and many of them evolved rumination or cecotropic behaviors 
> to better extract nutrients from plants. 
> 
> A large percentage of herbivores also have mutualistic gut flora 
> made up of bacteria and protozoans that help to degrade the cellulose in plants, 
> whose heavily cross-linking polymer structure makes it far more difficult to digest 
> than the protein- and fat-rich animal tissues that [[Carnivore]]s eat.
