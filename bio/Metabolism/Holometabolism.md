> **holometabolism**, also called complete metamorphosis, 
> is a form of insect development which includes four life stages: 
> - [[../Reproduction/Egg|Egg]], 
> - [[Larva]], 
> - pupa, and 
> - imago (or adult). 
> 
> Holometabolism is a synapomorphic trait of all insects in the clade Holometabola. 
> Immature stages of holometabolous insects are very different from the mature stage. 
> In some species, a holometabolous life cycle minimizes competition between larvae and adults 
> by separating their ecological niches. 
> 
> The morphology and behavior of each stage are adapted for different activities. 
> For example, larval traits maximize feeding, growth, and development, 
> while adult traits enable dispersal, mating, and egg laying. 
> 
> Some species of holometabolous insects protect and feed their offspring. 
> Other insect developmental strategies include ametabolism and hemimetabolism.
