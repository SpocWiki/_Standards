## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Nutrition** is the biochemical and physiological process 
> by which an organism uses food to support its life. 
> It provides organisms with nutrients, 
> which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures. 
> Failure to obtain the required amount of nutrients causes malnutrition. 
> Nutritional science is the study of nutrition, though it typically emphasizes human nutrition.
>
> The type of organism determines what nutrients it needs and how it obtains them. 
> Organisms obtain nutrients by consuming organic matter, 
> consuming inorganic matter, absorbing light, or some combination of these. 
> 
> Some can produce nutrients internally by consuming basic elements, 
> while some must consume other organisms to obtain pre-existing nutrients. 
> 
> All forms of life require carbon, energy, and water as well as various other molecules. 
> Animals require complex nutrients such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, 
> obtaining them by consuming other organisms. 
> 
> Humans have developed agriculture and cooking to replace foraging and advance human nutrition. 
> Plants acquire nutrients through the soil and the atmosphere. 
> Fungi absorb nutrients around them by breaking them down and absorbing them through the mycelium.
