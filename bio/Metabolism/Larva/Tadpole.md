## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Tadpole** or polliwog (also spelled pollywog) 
> is the larval stage in the biological life cycle of an amphibian. 
> 
> Most tadpoles are fully aquatic, 
> though some species of amphibians have tadpoles that are terrestrial. 
> 
> Tadpoles have some fish-like features that may not be found in adult amphibians, 
> such as a lateral line, gills and swimming tails. 
> As they undergo metamorphosis, 
> they start to develop functional lungs for breathing air, 
> and the diet of tadpoles changes drastically. 
>
> A few amphibians, such as some members of the frog family Brevicipitidae, undergo direct development –  i.e., they do not undergo a free-living larval stage as tadpoles –  instead emerging from eggs as fully formed "froglet" miniatures of the adult morphology. Some other species hatch into tadpoles underneath the skin of the female adult or are kept in a pouch until after metamorphosis. Having no hard skeletons, it might be expected that tadpole fossils would not exist. However, traces of biofilms have been preserved and fossil tadpoles have been found dating back to the Middle Jurassic. 
>
> Tadpoles are eaten as human food in some parts of the world and are mentioned in various folk tales from around the world.
