> Cellular **Respiration** is the process of oxidizing biological fuels 
> using an inorganic electron acceptor, such as oxygen, 
> to drive production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
> which stores chemical energy in a biologically accessible form. 
> 
> Cellular respiration may be described as a set of metabolic reactions and processes 
> that take place in the cells to transfer chemical energy from nutrients to ATP, 
> with the flow of electrons to an electron acceptor, and then release waste products.
>
> If the electron acceptor is oxygen, 
> the process is more specifically known as aerobic cellular respiration. 
> 
> If the electron acceptor is a molecule other than oxygen, 
> this is anaerobic cellular respiration – not to be confused with fermentation, 
> which is also an anaerobic process, but it is not respiration, 
> as no external electron acceptor is involved.

> The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, producing ATP. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it is an unusual one because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.

> Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (the bond of its third phosphate group to the rest of the molecule can be broken, allowing more stable products to form, thereby releasing energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion, or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.
