> A **Pupa** (from Latin  pupa 'doll'; pl.: pupae) 
> is the life stage of insects from the Holometabola clade 
> undergoing transformation between immature and mature stages. 
> 
> Insects that go through a pupal stage are holometabolous: 
> they go through four distinct stages in their life cycle, 
> the stages thereof being egg, larva, pupa, and imago. 
> 
> The processes of entering and completing the pupal stage 
> are controlled by the insect's hormones, especially juvenile hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone, and ecdysone. 
> 
> The act of becoming a pupa is called pupation, 
> and the act of emerging from the pupal case is called eclosion or emergence.
>
> The pupae of different groups of insects have different names such as 
> chrysalis for the pupae of butterflies and tumbler for those of the mosquito family. 
> 
> Pupae may further be enclosed in other structures such as cocoons, nests, or shells.
