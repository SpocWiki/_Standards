## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Vasco da Gama** ( VAS-koo də GA(H)M-ə; Portuguese: [ˈvaʃku ðɐ ˈɣɐmɐ]; c. 1460s – 24 December 1524), 
> was a Portuguese explorer and nobleman who was the first European to reach India by sea.
>
> His initial voyage to India by way of the Cape of Good Hope (1497–1499) 
> was the first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian oceans. 
> This was a milestone in Portuguese maritime exploration 
> which marked the beginning of a sea-based phase of globalization. 
> 
> Da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India opened the way for an age of global imperialism 
> and enabled the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire along the way from Africa to Asia. 
> Traveling the ocean route allowed the Portuguese 
> to avoid sailing across the highly disputed Mediterranean Sea 
> and traversing the dangerous Arabian Peninsula. 
> 
> The sum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages 
> made this expedition the longest ocean voyage ever made until then.
>
> After decades of sailors trying to reach the Indies, 
> with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, 
> da Gama landed at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498. 
> 
> Unopposed access to the Indian spice routes boosted the economy of the Portuguese Empire, 
> which was previously based along North and coastal West Africa. 
> The main spices at first obtained from Southeast Asia were pepper and cinnamon, 
> but soon included other products, all new to Europe. 
> Portugal maintained a commercial monopoly of these commodities for several decades. 
> It was not until a century later 
> that other European powers were able to challenge Portugal's monopoly 
> and naval supremacy in the Cape Route.
>
> Da Gama led two of the Portuguese India Armadas, the first and the fourth. 
> The latter was the largest and departed for India three years after his return from the first one. 
> For his contributions, in 1524 da Gama was appointed Governor of India, with the title of Viceroy, 
> and was ennobled as Count of Vidigueira in 1519. 
> 
> He remains a leading figure in the history of exploration, 
> and homages worldwide have celebrated his explorations and accomplishments. 
> The Portuguese national epic poem, Os Lusíadas, was written in his honour by Luís de Camões.
