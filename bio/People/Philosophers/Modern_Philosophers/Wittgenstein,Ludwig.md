> Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein ( VIT-gən-s(h)tyne; German: [ˈluːdvɪk ˈjoːzɛf 'joːhan ˈvɪtɡn̩ʃtaɪn]; 
> 26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian philosopher who worked primarily in logic, 
> the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. 
>
> From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge. 
> Despite his position, only one book of his philosophy was published during his entire life: 
> the 75-page Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung (Logical-Philosophical Treatise, 1921), 
> which appeared, together with an English translation, in 1922 
> under the Latin title Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. 
> 
> His only other published works were an article, "Some Remarks on Logical Form" (1929); 
> a book review; and a children's dictionary. 
> His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. 
> The first and best-known of this posthumous series is the 1953 book [[Philosophical_Investigations(book)]]. 
> A 1999 survey among American university and college teachers 
> ranked the Investigations as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, 
> standing out as "the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, 
> appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations".
>
> His philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the Tractatus, 
> and a later period, articulated primarily in the Philosophical Investigations. 
> The "early Wittgenstein" was concerned with the logical relationship 
> between propositions and the world, and he believed that 
> by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, 
> he had solved all philosophical problems. 
> The "later Wittgenstein", however, rejected many of the assumptions of the Tractatus, 
> arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given language game.
>
> Born in Vienna into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. 
> Before World War I, he "made a very generous financial bequest to a group of poets and artists 
> chosen by Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of Der Brenner, from artists in need. 
> These included Trakl as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and the architect Adolf Loos." 
> Later, in a period of severe personal depression after World War I, 
> he gave away his remaining fortune to his brothers and sisters. 
> Three of his four older brothers died by separate acts of suicide. 
> Wittgenstein left academia several times: serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, 
> where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; 
> teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages, where he encountered controversy 
> for using sometimes violent corporal punishment on girls and a boy (the Haidbauer incident) 
> especially during mathematics classes; working during World War II as a hospital porter in London; 
> and working as a hospital laboratory technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. 
> 
> He later expressed remorse for these incidents, and spent the remainder of his life lecturing 
> and attempting to prepare a second manuscript for publication, 
> which was published posthumously as the hugely influential Philosophical Investigations.
