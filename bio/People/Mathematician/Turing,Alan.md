> Alan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, 
> computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. 
> He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, 
> providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, 
> which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. 
> Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.
>
> Born in London, Turing was raised in southern England. 
> He graduated in maths from King's College, Cambridge, and in 1938, 
> earned a maths PhD from Princeton University. 
> 
> During the Second World War, Turing worked for the 
> Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, 
> Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. 
> 
> He led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. 
> Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, 
> including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, 
> an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. 
> He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages 
> that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, 
> including the Battle of the Atlantic.
>
> After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, 
> where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, 
> one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. 
> In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory 
> at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers 
> and became interested in mathematical biology. 
> 
> Turing wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis 
> and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, 
> first observed in the 1960s. 
> Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised during his lifetime 
> because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
>
> In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment, 
> a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. 
> Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged 41, from cyanide poisoning. 
> An inquest determined his death as suicide, 
> but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. 
>
> Following a campaign in 2009, British prime minister 
> Gordon Brown made an official public apology for "the appalling way [Turing] was treated". 
> Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013. 
> The term "**Alan Turing** law" is used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the UK 
> that retroactively pardoned men 
> cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.
>
> Turing has an extensive legacy with statues and many things named after him, 
> including an annual award for computer science innovations. 
> 
> He appears on the current Bank of England £50 note, 
> which was released on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday. 
> A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named Turing the greatest person of the 20th century.
