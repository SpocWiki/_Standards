> Hermann Günther Grassmann (German: Graßmann, 
> pronounced [ˈhɛʁman ˈɡʏntɐ ˈɡʁasman]; 15 April 1809 – 26 September 1877) 
> was a German polymath known in his day as a linguist 
> and now also as a mathematician. 
> 
> He was also a physicist, general scholar, and publisher. 
> His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties. 
> His work preceded and exceeded the concept 
> which is now known as a vector space. 
> 
> He introduced the [[Grassmannian]], 
> the space which parameterizes all k-dimensional linear subspaces 
> of an n-dimensional vector space V.
