> Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor ( KAN-tor, German: [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfɛʁdinant ˈluːtvɪç ˈfiːlɪp ˈkantoːɐ̯]; 3 March [O.S. 19 February] 1845 – 6 January 1918) 
> was a  mathematician who played a pivotal role in the creation of set theory, 
> which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics. 
> 
> Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, 
> defined infinite and well-ordered sets, 
> and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. 
> Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an infinity of infinities. 
> He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic. 
> Cantor's work is of great philosophical interest, a fact he was well aware of.
>
> Originally, Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers was regarded as counter-intuitive – even shocking. 
> This caused it to encounter resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker 
> and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, 
> while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections; see Controversy over Cantor's theory. 
> 
> Cantor, a devout Lutheran Christian, believed the theory had been communicated to him by God. 
> Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) 
> saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – 
> on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – 
> a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected. 
> Not all theologians were against Cantor's theory; 
> prominent neo-scholastic philosopher Constantin Gutberlet was in favor of it 
> and Cardinal Johann Baptist Franzelin accepted it as a valid theory 
> (after Cantor made some important clarifications).
>
> The objections to Cantor's work were occasionally fierce: 
> Leopold Kronecker's public opposition and personal attacks included 
> describing Cantor as a "scientific charlatan", a "renegade" and a "corrupter of youth". 
> Kronecker objected to Cantor's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable, 
> and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable, 
> results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum. 
> 
> Writing decades after Cantor's death, Wittgenstein lamented 
> that mathematics is "ridden through and through with the pernicious idioms of set theory", 
> which he dismissed as "utter nonsense" that is "laughable" and "wrong". 
> Cantor's recurring bouts of depression from 1884 to the end of his life 
> have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries, 
> though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a bipolar disorder.
>
> The harsh criticism has been matched by later accolades. 
> In 1904, the Royal Society awarded Cantor its Sylvester Medal, 
> the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics. 
> David Hilbert defended it from its critics by declaring, 
> "No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created."
