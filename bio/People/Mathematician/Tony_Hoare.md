> Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare , also known as Tony Hoare or by his initials C. A. R. Hoare 
> (; born 11 January 1934) is a British computer scientist 
> who has made foundational contributions to programming languages, algorithms, 
> operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. 
> His work earned him the Turing Award, 
> usually regarded as the highest distinction in computer science, in 1980.
>
> Hoare developed the sorting algorithm [[Quicksort]] in 1959–1960. 
> 
> He developed Hoare logic, an axiomatic basis for verifying program correctness. 
> 
> In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language 
> communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, 
> and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem. 
> Since 1977, he has held positions at the University of Oxford 
> and Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
>
> Tony Hoare was born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to British parents; 
> his father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter. 
> Hoare was educated in England at the Dragon School in Oxford 
> and the King's School in Canterbury. 
> 
> He then studied Classics and Philosophy ("Greats") at Merton College, Oxford. 
> 
> On graduating in 1956 he did 18 months National Service in the Royal Navy, 
> where he learned Russian. 
> He returned to the University of Oxford in 1958 
> to study for a postgraduate certificate in statistics, 
> and it was here that he began computer programming, 
> having been taught Autocode on the Ferranti Mercury by Leslie Fox. 
> He then went to Moscow State University as a British Council exchange student, 
> where he studied machine translation under Andrey Kolmogorov.
>
> In 1960, Hoare left the Soviet Union and began working at Elliott Brothers Ltd, 
> a small computer manufacturing firm located in London. 
> There, he implemented the language ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms.
>
> He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, 
> as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) 
> Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, 
> which specified, maintains, and supports the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.
>
> He became the Professor of Computing Science at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1968, 
> and in 1977 returned to Oxford as the Professor of Computing 
> to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory 
> (now Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford), 
> following the death of Christopher Strachey. 
> He became the first Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing on its establishment in 1988 
> until his retirement at Oxford in 2000. 
> He is now an Emeritus Professor there, 
> and is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
>
> Hoare's most significant work has been in the following areas: 
> his sorting and selection algorithm (Quicksort and Quickselect), 
> Hoare logic, 
> the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) 
> used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes 
> (and implemented in various programming languages such as occam), 
> structuring computer operating systems using the monitor concept, 
> and the axiomatic specification of programming languages.
>
> Speaking at a software conference in 2009, 
> Tony Hoare hyperbolically apologized for "inventing" the null reference:
>
> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. 
> At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system 
> for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). 
> My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, 
> with checking performed automatically by the compiler. 
> 
> But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, 
> simply because it was so easy to implement. 
> This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, 
> which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
>
> For many years under his leadership, 
> Hoare's Oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as CSP and Z. 
> These did not achieve the expected take-up by industry, 
> and in 1995 Hoare was led to reflect upon the original assumptions:
>
> Ten years ago, researchers into formal methods (and I was the most mistaken among them) 
> predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude 
> every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability 
> that arise when programs get large and more safety-critical. 
> 
> Programs have now got very large and very critical – 
> well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods. 
> 
> There have been many problems and failures, 
> but these have nearly always been attributable to inadequate analysis of requirements 
> or inadequate management control. 
> It has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem 
> that our research was originally intended to solve.
>
> A commemorative article was written in tribute to Hoare on his 90th birthday.
>
> In 1962, Hoare married Jill Pym, a member of his research team.
