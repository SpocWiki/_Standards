## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Zhu Xi** ([ʈʂú ɕí]; October 18, 1130 – April 23, 1200), formerly romanized Chu Hsi, 
> was a Chinese calligrapher, historian, philosopher, poet, and politician of the Southern Song dynasty. 
> 
> Zhu was influential in the development of Neo-Confucianism. 
> He contributed greatly to Chinese philosophy and fundamentally reshaped the Chinese worldview. 
> 
> His works include his editing of and commentaries to the Four Books (which later formed the curriculum of the imperial examinations in China between 1313 and 1905), his writings on the process of the 'investigation of things' (格物; géwù), and his development of meditation as a method for self-cultivation.
>
> Zhu was a scholar with a wide learning in the classics, commentaries, histories and other writings of his predecessors. In his lifetime, he was able to serve multiple times as a government official, although he avoided public office for most of his adult life. He also wrote, compiled and edited almost a hundred books and corresponded with dozens of other scholars. He acted as a teacher to groups of students, many of whom chose to study under him for years. He built upon the teachings of the Cheng brothers and others, further developing their metaphysical theories in regards to principle (li) and vital force (qi). His followers recorded thousands of his conversations in writing.
