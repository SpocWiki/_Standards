> **Socrates** (Greek: Σωκράτης, translit. Sōkrátēs; c. 470 – 399 BC) 
> was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy 
> and as among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought. 
> 
> An enigmatic figure, Socrates authored no texts 
> and is known mainly through the posthumous accounts of classical writers, 
> particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. 
> 
> These accounts are written as dialogues, 
> in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer; 
> they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue literary genre. 
> 
> Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, 
> a situation known as the Socratic problem. 
> 
> Socrates was a polarizing figure in Athenian society. 
> In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. 
> After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. 
> He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape.
>
> Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates 
> to survive from antiquity. They demonstrate the Socratic approach to areas of philosophy 
> including epistemology and ethics. 
> 
> The Platonic Socrates lends his name to the concept of the Socratic method, 
> and also to Socratic irony. 
> The Socratic method of questioning, or elenchus, takes shape in dialogue 
> using short questions and answers, epitomized by those Platonic texts 
> in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine various 
> aspects of an issue or an abstract meaning, usually relating to one of the virtues, 
> and find themselves at an impasse, 
> completely unable to define what they thought they understood. 
> Socrates is known for proclaiming his total ignorance; 
> he used to say that the only thing he was aware of was his ignorance, 
> seeking to imply that the realization of our ignorance is the first step in philosophizing.
>
> Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity 
> and has continued to do so in the modern era. 
> He was studied by medieval and Islamic scholars 
> and played an important role in the thought of the Italian Renaissance, 
> particularly within the humanist movement. 
> 
> Interest in him continued unabated, as reflected in the works of Søren Kierkegaard 
> and Friedrich Nietzsche. 
> Depictions of Socrates in art, literature, and popular culture 
> have made him a widely known figure in the Western philosophical tradition.
