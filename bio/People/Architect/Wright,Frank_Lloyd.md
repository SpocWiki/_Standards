> **Frank Lloyd Wright** Sr. (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) 
> was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator.  
> 
> He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. 
> Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, 
> influencing architects worldwide through his works 
> and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. 
> 
> Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, 
> a philosophy he called organic architecture. 
> This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), 
> which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture".
>
> Wright was a pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture 
> and also developed the concept of the Usonian home 
> in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. 
> 
> He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, 
> and other commercial projects. 
> 
> Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) 
> were integrated into these structures. 
> He wrote several books and numerous articles 
> and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. 
> 
> Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as 
> "the greatest American architect of all time". 
> 
> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site 
> as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.
>
> Raised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin 
> and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, 
> and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan.  
> 
> Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 
> and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. 
> 
> His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: 
> leaving his first wife Catherine "Kitty" Tobin for Mamah Cheneyin 1909; 
> the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; 
> his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923–1927); 
> and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazović (m. 1928–1959).
