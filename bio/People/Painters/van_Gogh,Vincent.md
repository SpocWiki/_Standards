> Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləɱ vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] ; 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) 
> was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter 
> who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. 
> 
> In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, 
> most of them in the last two years of his life. 
> 
> His oeuvre includes landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, 
> most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork 
> that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. 
> 
> Van Gogh's work was only beginning to gain critical attention 
> before he died from a self-inflicted gunshot at age 37. 
> During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard, was sold. 
>
> Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child 
> and was serious, quiet and thoughtful, but showed signs of mental instability. 
> 
> As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, 
> but became depressed after he was transferred to London. 
> He turned to religion and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium. 
> Later he drifted into ill-health and solitude. 
> He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art and, while back with his parents, took up painting in 1881. 
> His younger brother, Theo, supported him financially, 
> and the two of them maintained a long correspondence.
>
> Van Gogh's early works consist of mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers. 
> In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the artistic avant-garde, 
> including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism. 
> 
> Frustrated in Paris and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration, 
> in February 1888 Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France 
> to establish an artistic retreat and commune. 
> 
> Once there, his paintings grew brighter and he turned his attention to the natural world, 
> depicting local olive groves, wheat fields and sunflowers. 
> Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles and eagerly anticipated Gauguin's arrival in late 1888.
>
> Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions. 
> He worried about his mental stability, and often neglected his physical health, 
> did not eat properly and drank heavily. 
> 
> His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor 
> when, in a rage, he mutilated his left ear. 
> 
> Van Gogh spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. 
> After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, 
> he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. 
> His depression persisted, and 
> on 29 July 1890 Van Gogh died from his injuries after shooting himself in the chest with a revolver.
>
> Van Gogh's work began to attract critical artistic attention in the last year of his life. 
> After his death, his art and life story captured public imagination as an emblem of misunderstood genius, 
> due in large part to the efforts of his widowed sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. 
> 
> His bold use of colour, expressive line and thick application of paint 
> inspired avant-garde artistic groups like the Fauves and German Expressionists in the early 20th century. 
> 
> Van Gogh's work gained widespread critical and commercial success in the following decades, 
> and he has become a lasting icon of the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. 
> 
> Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings ever sold. 
> His legacy is celebrated by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, 
> which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.
