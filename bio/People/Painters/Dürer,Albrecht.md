> **Albrecht Dürer** (21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528), sometimes spelled in English as Durer, 
> was a German painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. 
> Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe in his twenties 
> due to his high-quality woodcut prints. 
> He was in contact with the major Italian artists of his time, 
> including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, Fra Luca Pacioli and Leonardo da Vinci, 
> and from 1512 was patronized by Emperor Maximilian I.
>
> Dürer's vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, 
> altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. 
> 
> The woodcuts series are stylistically more Gothic than the rest of his work, 
> but revolutionised the potential of that medium, 
> while his extraordinary handling of the burin expanded especially the tonal range of his engravings; 
> well-known engravings include the three Meisterstiche (master prints) 
> - Knight, Death and the Devil (1513), 
> - Saint Jerome in his Study (1514), and 
> - Melencolia I (1514). 
> 
> His watercolours mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, 
> and with his confident self-portraits he pioneered them as well as autonomous subjects of art.
>
> Dürer's introduction of classical motifs  and of the nude into Northern art, 
> through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, 
> has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. 
> 
> This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, 
> which involve principles of mathematics for linear perspective and body proportions.
