> Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) 
> was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer 
> who spent most of his adult life in France. 
> 
> One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, 
> the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, 
> and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. 
> 
> Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) 
> and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), 
> a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.
>
> Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, 
> painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. 
> 
> During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed 
> as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. 
> After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse 
> motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, 
> who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.
>
> Picasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. 
> While the names of many of his later periods are debated, 
> the most commonly accepted periods in his work are 
> - the Blue Period (1901–1904), 
> - the Rose Period (1904–1906), 
> - the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), 
> - Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and 
> - Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. 
> 
> Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, 
> and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. 
> His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.
>
> Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, 
> Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, 
> and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.
