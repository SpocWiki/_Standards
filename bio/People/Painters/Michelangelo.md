> **Michelangelo** di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), 
> known mononymously as Michelangelo, 
> was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. 
> 
> Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity 
> and had a lasting influence on Western art. 
> 
> Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas 
> define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, 
> along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. 
> 
> Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, 
> Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. 
> He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.
>
> Michelangelo achieved fame early. 
> Two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. 
> Although he did not consider himself a painter, 
> Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: 
> the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, 
> and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. 
> 
> His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. 
> At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. 
> Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, 
> as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.
>
> Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. 
> Three biographies were published during his lifetime. 
> One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that 
> Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, 
> and was "supreme in not one art alone but in all three".
>
> In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino ("the divine one"). 
> His contemporaries admired his terribilità—his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. 
> Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style 
> contributed to the rise of Mannerism, 
> a short-lived movement in Western art between the High Renaissance and the Baroque.
