> Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, Marquess of Dalí of Púbol 
>  (11 May 1904 – 23 January 1989), known as **Salvador Dalí** (DAH-LEE; [səlβəˈðo ðəˈli]), 
>  was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for his technical skill, precise draftsmanship, 
>  and the striking and bizarre images in his work. 
>
> Born in Figueres in Catalonia, Dalí received his formal education in fine arts in Madrid. 
> Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age, 
> he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. 
> 
> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, 
> soon becoming one of its leading exponents. 
> 
> His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. 
> Dalí lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) 
> before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. 
> He returned to Spain in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith 
> and developed his "nuclear mysticism" style, 
> based on his interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.
>
> Dalí's artistic repertoire included painting, sculpture, film, graphic arts, animation, fashion, 
> and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. 
> 
> He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays, and criticism. 
> Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science 
> and his closest personal relationships. 
> 
> To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, 
> and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior 
> often drew more attention than his artwork. 
> 
> His public support for the Francoist regime, his commercial activities 
> and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial. 
> 
> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art, popular culture, 
> and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.
>
> There are two major museums devoted to Salvador Dalí's work: 
> - the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Spain, and 
> - the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.
