> and Dutch and Flemish artists who had studied in Italy.  
> 
> After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, 
> Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. 
>

> his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters. 
> 
> Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits 
> and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. 
> His approximately 40 self-portraits form an intimate autobiography.
