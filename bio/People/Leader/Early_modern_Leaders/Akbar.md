> Abu'l-Fath Jalal-ud-din Muhammad **Akbar** (1542-10-15 – 1605-10-27, 
> popularly known as Akbar the Great, and also as Akbar I (Persian pronunciation: [ak.baɾ]), 
> was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. 
> 
> Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, 
> who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in the Indian subcontinent. 
> He is generally considered one of the greatest emperors in Indian history 
> and led a successful campaign to unify the various kingdoms of Hindūstān or India proper.
>
> Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include much of the Indian subcontinent 
> through Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. 
> To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration 
> and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. 
> To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, 
> he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects, 
> including abolishing the sectarian tax and appointing them to high civil and military posts.
>
> Under Akbar, Mughal India developed a strong and stable economy, 
> which tripled in size and wealth, leading to commercial expansion 
> and greater patronage of an Indo-Persian culture. 
> 
> Akbar's courts at Delhi, Agra, and Fatehpur Sikri attracted holy men of many faiths, 
> poets, architects, and artisans, and became known as centres of the arts, letters, and learning. 
> Timurid and Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements 
> into a distinct style of Mughal arts, including painting and architecture. 
> 
> Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, 
> Akbar promulgated Din-i Ilahi, a syncretic creed derived mainly from Islam and Hinduism 
> as well as elements of Zoroastrianism and Christianity.
>
> Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as Jahangir.
