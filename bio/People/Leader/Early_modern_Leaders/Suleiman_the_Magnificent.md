> Presiding over the apex of the Ottoman Empire's economic, military, and political strength, 
> Suleiman rose to become a prominent monarch of 16th-century Europe, 
> as he personally led Ottoman armies in their conquests of a number of European Christian strongholds 
> before his advances were finally checked at the siege of Vienna in 1529. 
> On the front against the Safavids, his efforts enabled the Ottomans to annex much of the Middle East, 
> in addition to large areas of North Africa as far west as modern-day Algeria. 
> Simultaneously, the Ottoman fleet dominated the seas from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea 
> and through the Persian Gulf.:
>
> At the helm of the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire, 
> Suleiman personally instituted major judicial changes 
> relating to society, education, taxation, and criminal law.

> His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the Ottoman chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, 
> harmonized the relationship between the two forms of Ottoman law: 
> sultanic (Kanun) and Islamic (Sharia). 
> He was a distinguished poet and goldsmith; he also became a great patron of fine culture,

> In 1533, Suleiman broke with Ottoman tradition by marrying Roxelana (Ukrainian: Роксолана), 
> a woman from his Imperial Harem. Roxelana, so named in Western Europe for her red hair, 
> was a Ruthenian who converted to Sunni Islam from Eastern Orthodox Chrisitianity 
> and thereafter became one of the most influential figures 
> of the "Sultanate of Women" period in the Ottoman Empire.

> Upon Suleiman's death in 1566, which ended his 46-year-long reign, 
> he was succeeded by his and Roxelana's son Selim II. 
> Suleiman's other potential heirs, Mehmed and Mustafa, had died; 
> Mehmed had succumbed to smallpox in 1543, 
> while Mustafa had been executed via strangling on Suleiman's orders in 1553. 
> His other son Bayezid was also executed on his orders, along with Bayezid's four sons, 
> after a rebellion in 1561. 
> 
> Although scholars typically regarded the period after his death to be one of crisis and adaptation 
> rather than of simple decline, the end of Suleiman's reign was a watershed in Ottoman history. 
> In the decades after Suleiman, 
> the Ottoman Empire began to experience significant political, institutional, and economic changes—
> a phenomenon often referred to as the Era of Transformation
