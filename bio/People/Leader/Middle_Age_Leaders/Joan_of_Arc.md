> **Joan of Arc** (French: Jeanne d'Arc [ʒan daʁk] ; Middle French: Jehanne Darc [ʒəˈãnə ˈdark]; 
> c. 1412 – 30 May 1431) is a patron saint of France, honored as a defender of the French nation 
> for her role in the siege of Orléans and her insistence on the coronation of Charles VII of France 
> during the Hundred Years' War. 
> 
> Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader 
> who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.
>
> Joan was born to a propertied peasant family at Domrémy in northeast France. 
> In 1428, she requested to be taken to Charles VII, 
> later testifying that she was guided by visions from the archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, 
> and Saint Catherine to help him save France from English domination. 
> 
> Convinced of her devotion and purity, Charles sent Joan, 
> who was about seventeen years old, to the siege of Orléans as part of a relief army. 
> 
> She arrived at the city in April 1429, wielding her banner and bringing hope to the demoralized French army. 
> Nine days after her arrival, the English abandoned the siege. 
> Joan encouraged the French to aggressively pursue the English during the Loire Campaign, 
> which culminated in another decisive victory at Patay, 
> opening the way for the French army to advance on Reims unopposed, 
> where Charles was crowned as the King of France with Joan at his side. 
> These victories boosted French morale, 
> paving the way for their final triumph in the Hundred Years' War several decades later.
>
> After Charles's coronation, Joan participated in the unsuccessful siege of Paris in September 1429 
> and the failed siege of La Charité in November. 
> Her role in these defeats reduced the court's faith in her. 
> 
> In early 1430, Joan organized a company of volunteers to relieve Compiègne, 
> which had been besieged by the Burgundians—French allies of the English. 
> She was captured by Burgundian troops on 23 May. 
> After trying unsuccessfully to escape, she was handed to the English in November. 
> 
> She was put on trial by Bishop Pierre Cauchon on accusations of heresy, 
> which included blaspheming by wearing men's clothes, acting upon visions that were demonic, 
> and refusing to submit her words and deeds to the judgment of the church. 
> She was declared guilty and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431, aged about nineteen.
>
> In 1456, an inquisitorial court reinvestigated Joan's trial and overturned the verdict, 
> declaring that it was tainted by deceit and procedural errors. 
> 
> Joan has been described as an obedient daughter of the Roman Catholic Church, an early feminist, 
> and a symbol of freedom and independence. She is popularly revered as a martyr. 
> 
> After the French Revolution, she became a national symbol of France. 
> In 1920, Joan of Arc was canonized by Pope Benedict XV 
> and, two years later, was declared one of the patron saints of France. 
> She is portrayed in numerous cultural works, including literature, music, paintings, sculptures, and theater.
