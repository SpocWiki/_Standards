> George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel ( HAN-dəl; baptised Georg Fried[e]rich Händel, German: 
> [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈhɛndl̩] ; 23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759) was a German-British Baroque composer 
> well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concertos. 
> 
> Handel received his training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy 
> before settling in London in 1712, where he spent the bulk of his career 
> and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. 
> 
> He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition 
> and by composers of the Italian Baroque. 
> In turn, Handel's music forms one of the peaks of the "high baroque" style, 
> bringing Italian opera to its highest development, 
> creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, 
> and introducing a new style into English church music. 
> He is consistently recognized as one of the greatest composers of his age.
>
> Handel started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. 
> In 1737, he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively, 
> addressed the middle class and made a transition to English choral works. 
> 
> After his success with Messiah (1742), he never composed an Italian opera again. 
> His orchestral Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks remain steadfastly popular. 
> One of his four coronation anthems, Zadok the Priest, 
> has been performed at every British coronation since 1727. 
> He died a respected and rich man in 1759, aged 74, and was given a state funeral at Westminster Abbey. 
>
> Interest in Handel's music has grown since the mid-20th century. 
> The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that "Handel was not only a great composer; 
> he was a dramatic genius of the first order." 
> His music was admired by Classical-era composers, especially Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven.
