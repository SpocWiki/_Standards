> Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) 
> was an English writer, prolific in many genres. 
> 
> He wrote more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories. 
> His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, 
> history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. 
> 
> Wells's science fiction novels are so well regarded 
> that he has been called the "father of science fiction".
>
> In addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime 
> as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents 
> to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. 
> 
> As a futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works 
> and foresaw aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television 
> and something resembling the World Wide Web. 
> 
> His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility 
> and biological engineering before these subjects were common in the genre. 
> [[Brian Aldiss]] referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction", 
> while Charles Fort called him a "wild talent". 
>
> Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail 
> alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work – dubbed "Wells's law" – 
> leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 with "O Realist of the Fantastic!". 
> 
> His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), 
> which was his first novella, The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), 
> The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), 
> the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907), 
> and the dystopian When the Sleeper Wakes (1910). 
> 
> Novels of social realism such as Kipps (1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910), 
> which describe lower-middle-class English life, 
> led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to [[Modern_Writers/Dickens,Charles|Charles Dickens]],:  
> but Wells described a range of social strata 
> and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. 
> Wells was nominated for the [[../../../International/NGO/Nobel_Prize|Nobel Prize]] in Literature four times.
>
> Wells's earliest specialised training was in biology, 
> and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a Darwinian context. 
> 
> He was also an outspoken socialist from a young age, often 
> (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) 
> sympathising with pacifist views. 
> 
> In his later years, he wrote less fiction 
> and more works expounding his political and social views, 
> sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist.  
> 
> Wells was a diabetic 
> and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (Diabetes UK) in 1934.
