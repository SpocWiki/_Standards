## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910), known by the pen name **Mark Twain**, 
> was an American writer, humorist, and essayist. 
> He was praised as the "greatest humorist the United States has produced," 
> with William Faulkner calling him "the father of American literature." 
> 
> Twain's novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, 
> Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), with the latter often called the "Great American Novel." 
> 
> He also wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889) and Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894) 
> and cowrote The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873) with Charles Dudley Warner. 
> The novelist Ernest Hemingway claimed that 
> "All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn."
>
> Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, 
> which later provided the setting for both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. 
> He served an apprenticeship with a printer early in his career, and then worked as a typesetter, 
> contributing articles to his older brother Orion Clemens' newspaper. 
> 
> Twain then became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, 
> which provided him the material for Life on the Mississippi (1883). 
> Soon after, Twain headed west to join Orion in Nevada. 
> He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, 
> turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise.
>
> Twain first achieved success as a writer 
> with the humorous story "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," 
> which was published in 1865; it was based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel 
> in Angels Camp, California, where Twain had spent some time while he was working as a miner. 
> The short story brought Twain international attention. 
> 
> He wrote both fiction and non-fiction. As his fame grew, Twain became a much sought-after speaker. 
> His wit and satire, both in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, 
> and Twain was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.
>
> Although Twain initially spoke out in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands, 
> he later reversed his position, going on to become vice president of the American Anti-Imperialist League 
> from 1901 until his death in 1910, coming out strongly against the Philippine–American War 
> and American colonialism. 
> Twain published a satirical pamphlet, "King Leopold's Soliloquy", in 1905 
> about Belgian atrocities in the Congo Free State.
>
> Twain earned a great deal of money from his writing and lectures, 
> but invested in ventures that lost most of it, such as the Paige Compositor, 
> a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. 
> He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, 
> but in time overcame his financial troubles 
> with the help of Standard Oil executive Henry Huttleston Rogers. 
> 
> Twain eventually paid all his creditors in full, 
> even though his declaration of bankruptcy meant he was not required to do so. 
> One hundred years after his death, the first volume of his autobiography was published. 
> 
> Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley's Comet and predicted that his death would accompany it as well, writing in 1909: “I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835; it’s coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It would be a great disappointment in my life if I don’t. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.'" He died a day after the comet was at its closest to Earth.
