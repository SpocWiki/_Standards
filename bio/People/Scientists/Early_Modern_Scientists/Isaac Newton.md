> Sir **Isaac Newton** (; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English polymath 
> active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author. 
> 
> Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. 
> His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), 
> first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. 
> 
> Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, 
> and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 
> for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz. 
> He contributed to and refined the scientific method, 
> and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.
>
> In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation 
> that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries 
> until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. 
> 
> He used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, 
> account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, 
> eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. 
> 
> Newton solved the two-body problem, and introduced the three-body problem. 
> He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for 
> by the same principles. 
> Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed 
> by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, 
> thereby convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.
>
> Newton built the first reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour 
> based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. 
> 
> His work on light was collected in his book Opticks, published in 1704. 
> He originated prisms as beam expanders and multiple-prism arrays, 
> which would later become integral to the development of tunable lasers. 
> 
> Newton also formulated an empirical law of cooling, which was the first heat transfer formulation 
> and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer, 
> made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, 
> and introduced the notions of a Newtonian fluid and a black body. 
> 
> Furthermore, he made early investigations into electricity, with an idea from his book Opticks 
> arguably the beginning of the field theory of the electric force. 
> 
> In addition to his creation of calculus, as a mathematician, 
> he generalized the binomial theorem to any real number, 
> contributed to the study of power series, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, 
> classified most of the cubic plane curves, 
> and also originated the Newton-Cotes formulas for numerical integration. 
> He further devised an early form of regression analysis.
>
> Newton was a fellow of Trinity College 
> and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge; 
> he was appointed at the age of 26. 
> 
> He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. 
> He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, 
> unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. 
> 
> Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, 
> Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, 
> but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. 
> 
> Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, 
> Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, 
> in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. 
> 
> He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, 
> serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, 
> in which he increased the accuracy and security of British coinage, 
> as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).
