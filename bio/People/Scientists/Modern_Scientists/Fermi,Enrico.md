## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Enrico Fermi** (Italian: [enˈriːko ˈfermi]; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) 
> was an Italian and naturalized American physicist, 
> renowned for being the creator of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, 
> and a member of the Manhattan Project. 
> He has been called the "architect of the nuclear age" and the "architect of the atomic bomb". 
> He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. 
> Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics 
> for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment 
> and for the discovery of transuranium elements. 
> 
> With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, 
> all of which were taken over by the US government. 
> He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, 
> and nuclear and particle physics.
>
> Fermi's first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics. 
> After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925, 
> Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas, 
> employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. 
> Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called "fermions". 
> 
> Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle 
> emitted along with an electron during beta decay, to satisfy the law of conservation of energy. 
> Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, 
> which he named the "neutrino". 
> 
> His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction and now called weak interaction, 
> described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. 
> 
> Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron, 
> Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones, 
> and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this. 
> After bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, 
> he concluded that he had created new elements. 
> Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, 
> the new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products.
>
> Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected his Jewish wife, Laura Capon. 
> He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. 
> Fermi led the team at the University of Chicago that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, 
> which went critical on 2 December 1942, 
> demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. 
> He was on hand when the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee went critical in 1943, 
> and when the B Reactor at the Hanford Site did so the next year. 
> At Los Alamos, he headed F Division, 
> part of which worked on Edward Teller's thermonuclear "Super" bomb. 
> He was present at the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, the first test of a full nuclear bomb explosion, 
> where he used his Fermi method to estimate the bomb's yield.
>
> After the war, he helped establish the Institute for Nuclear Studies in Chicago, 
> and served on the General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, 
> which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters. 
> 
> After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, 
> he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. 
> He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf 
> at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. 
>
> Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, 
> and he speculated that cosmic rays arose 
> when the material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. 
> 
> Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, 
> including the Fermi 1 (breeder reactor),  the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station,  
> the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), 
> the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Fermi paradox, 
> and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.
