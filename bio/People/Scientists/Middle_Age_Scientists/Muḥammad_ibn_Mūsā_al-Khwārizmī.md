## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (Persian: محمد بن موسى خوارزمی; c. 780 – c. 850), 
> or simply al-Khwarizmi, was a polymath 
> who produced vastly influential Arabic-language works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. 
> Around 820, he worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, 
> the contemporary capital city of the Abbasid Caliphate.
>
> His popularizing treatise on algebra, compiled between 813–833 
> as Al-Jabr (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing), 
> presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. 
> 
> One of his achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve quadratic equations 
> by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications.  
> Because al-Khwarizmi was the first person to treat algebra as an independent discipline 
> and introduced the methods of "reduction" and "balancing" 
> (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, 
> that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation), 
> he has been described as the father or founder of algebra. 
> 
> The English term algebra comes from the short-hand title of his aforementioned treatise (الجبر Al-Jabr,  
> transl. "completion" or "rejoining"). 
> His name gave rise to the English terms algorism and algorithm; 
> the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese terms algoritmo; 
> and the Spanish term guarismo and Portuguese term algarismo, both meaning 'digit'.
>
> In the 12th century, Latin translations of al-Khwarizmi's textbook on Indian arithmetic 
> (Algorithmo de Numero Indorum), which codified the various Indian numerals, 
> introduced the decimal-based positional number system to the Western world. 
> Likewise, Al-Jabr, translated into Latin by the English scholar Robert of Chester in 1145, 
> was used until the 16th century as the principal mathematical textbook of European universities.
>
> Al-Khwarizmi revised Geography, 
> the 2nd-century Greek-language treatise by the Roman polymath Claudius Ptolemy, 
> listing the longitudes and latitudes of cities and localities. 
> He further produced a set of astronomical tables and wrote about calendric works, 
> as well as the astrolabe and the sundial. 
> Al-Khwarizmi made important contributions to trigonometry, 
> producing accurate sine and cosine tables and the first table of tangents.
