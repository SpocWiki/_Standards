> **Jane Austen** ( OST-in, AW-stin; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) 
> was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels, which implicitly interpret, critique, 
> and comment on the English landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. 
> 
> Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage 
> for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. 
> Her works are implicit critiques of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century 
> and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. 
> Her use of social commentary, realism, wit, and irony 
> have earned her acclaim amongst critics and scholars.
>
> The anonymously published 
> - Sense and Sensibility (1811), 
> - Pride and Prejudice (1813), 
> - Mansfield Park (1814), and 
> - Emma (1816) 
> were modest successes, but they brought her little fame in her lifetime. 
> She wrote two other novels—Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1817—and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but it was left unfinished on her death. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel Lady Susan, and the unfinished novel The Watsons.

> (illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering and sold as a set).
