> Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) 
> was an English novelist, journalist, short story writer and social critic. 
> 
> He created some of literature's best-known fictional characters, 
> and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. 
> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime 
> and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. 
> His novels and short stories are widely read today.
>
> Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at age 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory 
> when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. 
> 
> After three years, he returned to school before beginning his literary career as a journalist. 
> Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years; wrote 15 novels, five novellas, 
> hundreds of short stories and nonfiction articles; 
> lectured and performed readings extensively; was a tireless letter writer; 
> and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education and other social reforms.
>
> Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers, 
> a publishing phenomenon—thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller—
> that sparked Pickwick merchandise and spin-offs. 
> 
> Within a few years, Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, 
> famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. 
> 
> His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly instalments, 
> pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, 
> which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. 
> 
> Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense. 
> The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, 
> and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. 
> 
> For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress 
> at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her own disabilities, 
> Dickens improved the character with positive features. 
> 
> His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. 
> Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny 
> to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.
>
> His 1843 novella A Christmas Carol remains especially popular 
> and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. 
> Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted 
> and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. 
> 
> His 1853 novel Bleak House, a satire on the judicial system, 
> helped support a reformist movement that culminated in the 1870s legal reform in England. 
> 
> A Tale of Two Cities (set in London and Paris) is regarded as his best-known work of historical fiction. 
> The most famous celebrity of his era, in response to public demand, 
> he undertook a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career. 
> The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, 
> such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.
