> James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) 
> was an Irish novelist, poet, and literary critic. 
> 
> He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement 
> and is regarded as one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. 
> 
> Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922) is a landmark 
> in which the episodes of Homer's Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, 
> particularly stream of consciousness. 
> 
> Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), 
> and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). 
> His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, letters, and occasional journalism.
>
> Joyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family. 
> He attended the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare, 
> then, briefly, the Christian Brothers–run O'Connell School. 
> 
> Despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances, 
> he excelled at the Jesuit Belvedere College and graduated from University College Dublin in 1902. 
> 
> In 1904, he met his future wife, Nora Barnacle, and they moved to mainland Europe. 
> He briefly worked in Pola and then moved to Trieste in Austria-Hungary, working as an English instructor. 
> 
> Except for an eight-month stay in Rome working as a correspondence clerk and three visits to Dublin, 
> Joyce lived there until 1915. 
> In Trieste, he published his book of poems Chamber Music and his short story collection Dubliners, 
> and began serially publishing A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in the English magazine The Egoist. 
> 
> During most of World War I, Joyce lived in Zurich, Switzerland, and worked on Ulysses. 
> After the war, he briefly returned to Trieste and in 1920 moved to Paris, 
> which was his primary residence until 1940.
>
> Ulysses was first published in Paris in 1922, 
> but its publication in the United Kingdom and the United States was prohibited 
> because of its perceived obscenity. 
> 
> Copies were smuggled into both countries and pirated versions were printed up until the mid-1930s 
> when publication became legal. 
> 
> Joyce started his next major work, Finnegans Wake, in 1923, publishing it sixteen years later in 1939. 
> Between these years, Joyce travelled widely. 
> He and Nora were married in a civil ceremony in London in 1931. 
> He made several trips to Switzerland, 
> frequently seeking treatment for his increasingly severe eye problems 
> and psychological help for his daughter, Lucia. 
> When France was occupied by Germany during World War II, 
> Joyce moved back to Zurich in 1940. He died there in 1941 after surgery for a perforated ulcer at age 58.
>
> Ulysses frequently ranks high in lists of great books, 
> and academic literature analysing his work is extensive and ongoing. 
> 
> Many writers, film-makers, and other artists have been influenced by his stylistic innovations, 
> such as his meticulous attention to detail, use of interior monologue, wordplay, 
> and the radical transformation of traditional plot and character development. 
> 
> Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, his fictional universe centres on Dublin 
> and is largely populated by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and 
> friends from his time there. 
> 
> Ulysses is set in the streets and alleyways of the city. 
> Joyce is quoted as saying, "For myself, I always write about Dublin, 
> because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. 
> In the particular is contained the universal."
