> **Franz Kafka** (3 July 1883 â€“ 3 June 1924) was a Jewish Austrian-Czech novelist and writer 
> from Prague who wrote in German. 
> 
> He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature. 
> His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, 
> and typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surrealistic predicaments 
> and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. 
> 
> It has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. 
> His best known works include the novella The Metamorphosis (1915) 
> and the novels The Trial (1924) and The Castle (1926). 
> The term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his writing.
>
> Kafka was born into a middle-class German- and Yiddish-speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, 
> the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, 
> which belonged to the Austrian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 
> (today the capital of the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia). 
> 
> He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education 
> was employed full-time in various legal and insurance jobs. 
> Being employed full-time forced Kafka to relegate writing to his spare time. 
> Few of his works were published during his lifetime; 
> the story collections Contemplation (1912) and A Country Doctor (1919), 
> and individual stories, such as his novella The Metamorphosis, were published in literary magazines, 
> but they received little attention. 
> 
> Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, 
> including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. 
> He became engaged to several women but never married. 
> He died relatively unknown in 1924 of tuberculosis, at the age of 40.
>
> Kafka was a prolific writer, 
> but he burned an estimated 90 percent of his total work due to persistent struggles with self-doubt. 
> 
> Much of the remaining 10 percent is lost or otherwise unpublished. 
> In his will, Kafka instructed his close friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy his unfinished works, 
> including his novels The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika (1927), 
> but Brod ignored these instructions and had much of his work published. 
> 
> Kafka's writings became famous in German-speaking countries after World War II, 
> influencing German literature, and its influence spread elsewhere in the world in the 1960s. 
> It has also influenced artists, composers, and philosophers.
