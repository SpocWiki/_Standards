> Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (; Russian: Антон Павлович Чехов, 29 January 1860 – 15 July 1904) 
> was a Russian playwright and short-story writer. 
> 
> His career as a playwright produced four classics, 
> and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. 
> Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as 
> one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. 
> Chekhov was a physician by profession. 
> "Medicine is my lawful wife," he once said, "and literature is my mistress."
>
> Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896, 
> but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre, 
> which subsequently also produced Chekhov's Uncle Vanya 
> and premiered his last two plays, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard. 
> 
> These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, 
> because in place of conventional action 
> Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text." 
> The plays that Chekhov wrote were not complex, but easy to follow, 
> and created a somewhat haunting atmosphere for the audience.
>
> Chekhov began writing stories to earn money, 
> but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations 
> that influenced the evolution of the modern short story. 
> 
> He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, 
> insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.
