> Publius Vergilius Maro (Latin: [ˈpuːbliʊs wɛrˈɡɪliʊs ˈmaroː]; 15 October 70 BC – 21 September 19 BC), 
> usually called **Virgil** or Vergil ( VUR-jil) in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. 
> 
> He composed three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: 
> - the Eclogues (or Bucolics), 
> - the Georgics, and 
> - the epic Aeneid. 
> 
> A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, were attributed to him in ancient times, 
> but modern scholars generally regard these works as spurious, 
> with the possible exception of a few short pieces.
>
> Already acclaimed in his own lifetime as a classic author, 
> Virgil rapidly replaced Ennius and other earlier authors as a standard school text, 
> and stood as the most popular Latin poet through late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and early modernity, 
> exerting inestimable influence on all subsequent Western literature. 
> 
> Geoffrey Chaucer assigned Virgil a uniquely position among all the celebrities of human history 
> in The House of Fame (1374–85), describing him as standing on a pilere / that was of tinned yren clere 
> ("on a pillar that was of bright tin-plated iron"), 
> and in the Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and Purgatory, 
> Dante pays tribute to Virgil with the words 
> "tu se' solo colui da cu'io tolsi / lo bello stile che m'ha fatto onore" (Inf. I.86–7) 
> ("thou art alone the one from whom I took the beautiful style that has done honour to me"). 
> 
> In the 20th Century, T. S. Eliot famously began a lecture on the subject "What Is a Classic?" 
> by asserting as self-evidently true that "whatever the definition we arrive at, 
> it cannot be one which excludes Virgil – 
> we may say confidently that it must be one which will expressly reckon with him."
