## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Archimedes** of Syracuse ( AR-kim-EE-deez; c. 287 – c. 212 BC) 
> was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, 
> and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily. 
> 
> Although few details of his life are known, 
> he is considered one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. 
> Regarded as the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time, 
> Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis 
> by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion 
> to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems. 
> These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, 
> the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, 
> the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.
>
> Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi (π), 
> defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, 
> and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. 
> He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, 
> working on statics and hydrostatics. 
> 
> Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever, 
> the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, 
> and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy known as Archimedes' principle. 
> 
> In astronomy, he made measurements of the apparent diameter of the Sun and the size of the universe. 
> He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, 
> and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.
>
> Archimedes died during the siege of Syracuse, 
> when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. 
> Cicero describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder 
> that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his most valued mathematical discovery.
>
> Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. 
> Alexandrian mathematicians read and quoted him, 
> but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD 
> by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, 
> while Eutocius' commentaries on Archimedes' works in the same century 
> opened them to wider readership for the first time. 
> 
> The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the Middle Ages 
> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance and again in the 17th century, 
> while the discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest 
> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.
