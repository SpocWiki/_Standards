> Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev ( MEN-dəl-AY-əf; 8 February 1834 – 2 February 1907) 
> was a Russian chemist known for formulating the periodic law 
> and creating a version of the periodic table of elements. 
> 
> He used the periodic law not only to correct the then-accepted properties of some known elements, 
> such as the valence and atomic weight of uranium, 
> but also to predict the properties of three elements that were yet to be discovered 
> (germanium, gallium and scandium).
