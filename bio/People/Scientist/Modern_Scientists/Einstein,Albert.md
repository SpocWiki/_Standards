> **Albert Einstein** (, EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) 
> was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theories of relativity. 
> Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. 
> 
> His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, 
> has been called "the world's most famous equation". 
> He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, 
> and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
>
> Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. 
> In 1897, at the age of seventeen he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program 
> at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, graduating in 1900. 
> 
> He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later 
> and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. 
> 
> In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. 
> In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, 
> becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. 
> In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. 
> Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, 
> and was granted American citizenship in 1940. 
> 
> On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
> alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research.
>
> In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year). 
> These papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, 
> introduced his special theory of relativity, 
> and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. 
> In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. 
> A cosmological paper that he published the following year 
> laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. 
> 
> In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which laid the foundations for the concepts of both laser and maser, 
> and contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, 
> such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. 
> A joint paper in 1935, with physicist Nathan Rosen, introduced the notion of a wormhole.
>
> In the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. 
> Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of photons. 
> With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose-Einstein statistics. 
> 
> For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. 
> 
> First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness 
> into science's picture of the world, objecting that God does not play dice. 
> 
> Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory 
> by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. 
> 
> As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics. 
> In 1999, he was named Time's  Person of the Century.
