> **James Clerk Maxwell**  (13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879) was a Scottish physicist and mathematician 
> who was responsible for the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, 
> which was the first theory to describe electricity, magnetism and light 
> as different manifestations of the same phenomenon. 
> 
> Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism achieved the second great unification in physics, 
> where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton. 
> Maxwell was also key in the creation of statistical mechanics.
>
> With the publication of "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field" in 1865, 
> Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves 
> moving at the speed of light. 
> 
> He proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium 
> that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. 
> The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to his prediction of the existence of radio waves, 
> and the paper contained his final version of his equations, which he had been working on since 1856. 
> 
> As a result of his equations, and other contributions 
> such as introducing an effective method to deal with network problems and linear conductors, 
> he is regarded as a founder of the modern field of electrical engineering. 
> In 1871, Maxwell became the first Cavendish Professor of Physics, serving until his death in 1879.
>
> Maxwell was the first to derive the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, 
> a statistical means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases, 
> which he worked on sporadically throughout his career. 
> 
> He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 
> and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) 
> like those in many bridges. 
> 
> Maxwell helped to established the CGS system of measurement, 
> and he is responsible for modern dimensional analysis. 
> 
> Maxwell is also recognized for laying the groundwork for chaos theory. 
> Maxwell correctly predicted that the rings of Saturn were made up of many unattached small fragments. 
> 
> His 1863 paper On Governors serves as an important foundation for control theory and cybernetics, 
> and was also the earliest mathematical analysis on control systems. 
> In 1867, he proposed the thought experiment known as Maxwell's demon.
>
> His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, 
> laying the foundations for such fields as relativity, 
> also being the one to introduce the term into physics, and quantum mechanics. 
> Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist 
> having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. 
> 
> His contributions to the science are considered by many 
> to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. 
> 
> In the millennium poll—a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists—
> Maxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein, 
> with another survey of rank-and-file physicists also voting him third. 
> 
> On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, 
> his work was described by Einstein as 
> the "most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton". 
> 
> When Einstein visited the University of Cambridge in 1922, 
> he was told by his host that he had done great things because he stood on Newton's shoulders; 
> Einstein replied: "No I don't. I stand on the shoulders of Maxwell." 
> 
> Tom Siegfried described Maxwell as "one of those once-in-a-century geniuses 
> who perceived the physical world with sharper senses than those around him".
