## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1870 – 21 January 1924), 
> better known as **Vladimir Lenin**, was a Russian revolutionary, politician and political theorist 
> who was the founder and first head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 until his death in 1924, 
> and of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death. 
> 
> As the founder and leader of the Bolsheviks, Lenin led the October Revolution 
> which established the world's first socialist state. 
> His government won the Russian Civil War and created a one-party state under the Communist Party. 
> Ideologically a Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called Leninism.
>
> Born into a middle-class family in Simbirsk, 
> Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's execution in 1887. 
> He was expelled from Kazan Imperial University 
> for participating in protests against the Tsarist government, 
> and devoted the following years to a law degree before relocating to Saint Petersburg in 1893 
> and becoming a leading Marxist activist. 
> In 1897, Lenin was arrested for sedition and exiled to Siberia for three years, 
> after which he moved to Western Europe 
> and became a key figure in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. 
> In the party's 1903 schism, he led his Bolshevik faction against the Mensheviks. 
> Lenin briefly returned to Russia during the failed Revolution of 1905, 
> and during World War I campaigned for its transformation into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, 
> which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the collapse of capitalism and the rise of socialism. 
> After the February Revolution of 1917 ousted Tsar Nicholas II and established a Provisional Government, 
> Lenin returned to Russia and played a leading role in the October Revolution, 
> in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the regime.
>
> Lenin's government abolished private ownership of land, nationalised major industry and banks, 
> withdrew from the war by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, 
> and promoted world revolution through the Communist International. 
> The Bolsheviks initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries 
> and allowed a multi-party Constituent Assembly, 
> but during the Russian Civil War centralised power in their Communist Party 
> and suppressed opposition in the Red Terror, in which tens of thousands were killed or imprisoned. 
> 
> Responding to devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, 
> Lenin reversed his policy of war communism in 1921 and stabilised the economy 
> by introducing the New Economic Policy. 
> The Soviet Red Army defeated several right- and left-wing anti-Bolshevik and separatist armies in the civil war, after which some of the non-Russian nations which had broken away from the empire were re-united in the Soviet Union in 1922; others, notably Poland, gained independence. Lenin suffered three debilitating strokes in 1922 and 1923 before his death in 1924, beginning a power struggle which ended in the rise to power of Joseph Stalin.
>
> Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Under Stalin, he became an ideological figurehead of Marxism–Leninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive figure, Lenin is praised by his supporters for establishing a revolutionary government which took steps towards socialism, while his critics accuse him of establishing a dictatorship which oversaw mass killings and political repression. Today, he is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century.
