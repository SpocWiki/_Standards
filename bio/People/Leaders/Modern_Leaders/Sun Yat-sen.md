> After the success of the 1911 Revolution, Sun proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of China but had to relinquish the presidency to general Yuan Shikai, ultimately going into exile in Japan. He later returned to launch a revolutionary government in southern China to challenge the warlords who controlled much of the country following Yuan's death in 1916. In 1923, Sun invited representatives of the Communist International to Guangzhou to reorganize the KMT and formed the First United Front with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, Chiang Kai-shek, in the Northern Expedition. While residing in Beijing, Sun died of gallbladder cancer in 1925.

> Uniquely among 20th-century Chinese leaders, 
> Sun is revered in both Taiwan (where he is officially the "Father of the Nation") 
> and in the People's Republic of China (where he is officially the "Forerunner of the Revolution") 
> for his instrumental role in ending Qing rule 
> and overseeing the conclusion of the Chinese dynastic system. 
> 
> His political philosophy, known as the Three Principles of the People, 
> sought to modernise China by advocating for nationalism, democracy, 
> and the livelihood of the people in an ethnically harmonious union (Zhonghua minzu). 
> The philosophy is commemorated as the National Anthem of the Republic of China, which Sun composed.
