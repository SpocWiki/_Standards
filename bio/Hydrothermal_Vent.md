> Hydrothermal vents are fissures on the seabed from which geothermally heated water discharges. 
> They are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas 
> where tectonic plates are moving apart at mid-ocean ridges, ocean basins, and hotspots. 
> 
> The dispersal of hydrothermal fluids throughout the global ocean at active vent sites creates hydrothermal plumes. 
> Hydrothermal deposits are rocks and mineral ore deposits formed by the action of hydrothermal vents.
>
> Hydrothermal vents exist because the Earth is both geologically active 
> and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. 
> 
> Under the sea, they may form features called **black smoker**s or white smokers, 
> which deliver a wide range of elements to the world's oceans, 
> thus contributing to global marine biogeochemistry. 
> 
> Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, 
> often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. 
> 
> Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea found around hydrothermal vents form the base of the food chain, 
> supporting diverse organisms including giant tube worms, clams, limpets, and shrimp. 
> Active hydrothermal vents are thought to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, 
> and it is speculated that ancient hydrothermal vents once existed on Mars.
>
> Hydrothermal vents have been hypothesized to have been 
> a significant factor to starting abiogenesis and the survival of primitive life. 
> The conditions of these vents have been shown to support the synthesis of molecules important to life. 
> Some evidence suggests that certain vents such as alkaline hydrothermal vents 
> or those containing supercritical CO2 are more conducive to the formation of these organic molecules. 
> However, the origin of life is a widely debated topic, and there are many conflicting viewpoints.
