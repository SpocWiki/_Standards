## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 – c. December 26, 1985) was an American primatologist and conservationist 
> known for undertaking an extensive study of mountain gorilla groups from 1966 until her murder in 1985. 
> 
> She studied them daily in the mountain forests of [[../../Earth/Continent/Africa/Africa~Central/Rwanda|Rwanda]], initially encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. 
> Gorillas in the Mist, a book published two years before her death, 
> is Fossey's account of her scientific study of the gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center and prior career. 
> It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name.
>
> Fossey was a leading primatologist, and a member of the "Trimates", a group of female scientists recruited by Leakey 
> to study great apes in their natural environments, along with Jane Goodall who studied chimpanzees, 
> and [[Galdikas,Birutė]], who studies orangutans.
>
> Fossey spent 20 years in Rwanda, where she supported conservation efforts, 
> strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, 
> and made more people acknowledge the sapience of gorillas. 
> 
> Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985. 
> Although Fossey's American research assistant was convicted in absentia, there is no consensus as to who killed her.
>
> Her research and conservation work helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain gorillas.
