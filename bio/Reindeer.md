# [[Reindeer]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Reindeer** or caribou (Rangifer tarandus) 
> is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, 
> native to Arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions 
> of Northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. 
> 
> It is the only representative of the genus Rangifer. 
> More recent studies suggest the splitting of reindeer and caribou into six distinct species over their range.
>
> Reindeer occur in both migratory and sedentary populations, 
> and their herd sizes vary greatly in different regions. 
> The tundra subspecies are adapted for extreme cold, and some are adapted for long-distance migration.
>
> Reindeer vary greatly in size and color from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer (R. (t.) platyrhynchus), 
> to the largest, Osborn's caribou (R. t. osborni). 
> Although reindeer are quite numerous, some species are in decline and considered vulnerable. 
> They are unique among deer (Cervidae) in that females may have antlers, 
> although the prevalence of antlered females varies by subspecies.
>
> Reindeer are the only successfully semi-domesticated deer on a large scale in the world. 
> Both wild and domestic reindeer have been an important source of food, clothing, 
> and shelter for Arctic people from prehistorical times.  
> 
> They are still herded and hunted today. 
> In some traditional Christmas legends, Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky 
> to help Santa Claus deliver gifts to good children on Christmas Eve.
