# Tree_of_Life   

The [Tree of Life (Biology) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology))is a hierarchical Folder Structure  
of the evolutionary relationships among living organisms. 
Each Folder represents a phylogenetic Group. 

It depicts the evolutionary history of species, 
illustrating how they are related through common ancestors 
and how they have diversified over time 
through processes such as speciation and genetic divergence.
