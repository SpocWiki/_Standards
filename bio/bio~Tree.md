# Tree_of_Life   

The [Tree of Life (Biology) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology))is a hierarchical Folder Structure  
of the evolutionary relationships among living organisms. 
Each Folder represents a phylogenetic Group. 

It depicts the evolutionary history of species, 
illustrating how they are related through common ancestors 
and how they have diversified over time 
through processes such as genetic divergence and isolation.

This is much more detailed than the 8-Level [[bio~Domain]] [[Taxonomy]] created in the 1990s.

> [!warning] This is a very deep folder Structure with up to 200-Character-long Paths! 
> Make sure to check it out into a shallow Location on Windows! 
> 
> Due to the Depth of this Tree, some Names had to be abbreviated 
> to fit into the 260 Character Limit imposed e.g. by Windows. 
> 
> If you see an opportunity to reduce this Depth, create an Issue and discuss first, 
> because Changes may break Links or at least require every User
