> **Zoology** (UK:  zoo-OL-ə-jee,  US:  zoh-OL-ə-jee) is the scientific study of animals. 
> Its studies include the structure, embryology, classification, habits, and distribution of 
> all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. 
> 
> Zoology is one of the primary branches of biology. 
> The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον, zōion ('animal'), and λόγος, logos ('knowledge', 'study').
>
> Although humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, 
> and used this knowledge to domesticate certain species, 
> the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with Aristotle. 
> 
> He viewed animals as living organisms, studied their structure and development, 
> and considered their adaptations to their surroundings and the function of their parts. 
> Modern zoology has its origins during the Renaissance and early modern period, with 
> Carl Linnaeus, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and many others.
>
> The study of animals has largely moved on to deal with form and function, adaptations, relationships between groups, behaviour and ecology. Zoology has increasingly been subdivided into disciplines such as classification, physiology, biochemistry and evolution. With the discovery of the structure of DNA by Francis Crick and James Watson in 1953, the realm of molecular biology opened up, leading to advances in cell biology, developmental biology and molecular genetics.
