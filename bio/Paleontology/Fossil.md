> A **Fossil** (from Classical Latin fossilis, lit. 'obtained by digging') 
> is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. 
> Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, 
> objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. 
> The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record. 
> Though the fossil record is incomplete, 
> numerous studies have demonstrated that there is enough information available 
> to give a good understanding of the pattern of diversification of life on Earth. 
> In addition, the record can predict and fill gaps such as the discovery of Tiktaalik in the arctic of Canada.
>
> Paleontology includes the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. 
> Specimens are sometimes considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. 
> The oldest fossils are around 3.48 billion years  to 4.1 billion years old. 
> The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata 
> led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. 
> The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century 
> allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host.
>
> There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, 
> authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration.
>
> Fossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1 μm) bacteria 
> to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. 
> 
> The largest presently known is a Sequoia sp. measuring 88 m (289 ft) in length at Coaldale, Nevada. 
> A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, 
> usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, 
> or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. 
> 
> Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, 
> such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). 
> 
> These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils, as opposed to body fossils. 
> Some fossils are biochemical and are called chemofossils or biosignatures.
