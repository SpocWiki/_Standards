> Competition is an interaction between organisms or species 
> in which both require one or more resources that are in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). 
> Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved 
> since the presence of one of the organisms always 
> reduces the amount of the resource available to the other.
>
> In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species 
> is an important biological interaction. 
> Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors 
> that affect community structure, species diversity, and population dynamics 
> (shifts in a population over time).
>
> There are three major mechanisms of competition (in order from most direct to least direct): 
> - interference, 
> - exploitation, and 
> - apparent competition. 
> Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, 
> while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, 
> but instead share a predator. 
> 
> Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition.

> According to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources must either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. According to evolutionary theory, competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven not by competition between organisms, but by these animals adapting to colonize empty livable space; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.
