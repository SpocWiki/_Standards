> Competition is an interaction between organisms or species 
> in which both require one or more resources that are in limited supply (such as food, water, or territory). 
> Competition lowers the fitness of both organisms involved 
> since the presence of one of the organisms always 
> reduces the amount of the resource available to the other.
>
> In the study of community ecology, competition within and between members of a species 
> is an important biological interaction. 
> Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors 
> that affect community structure, species diversity, and population dynamics 
> (shifts in a population over time).
>
> There are three major mechanisms of competition (in order from most direct to least direct): 
> - interference, 
> - exploitation, and 
> - apparent competition. 
> Interference and exploitation competition can be classed as "real" forms of competition, 
> while apparent competition is not, as organisms do not share a resource, 
> but instead share a predator. 
> 
> Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, 
> while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition.
>
> According to the competitive exclusion principle, 
> species less suited to compete for resources must either adapt or die out, 
> although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. 
> 
> According to evolutionary theory, 
> competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. 
> More recently, however, researchers have suggested that evolutionary 
> biodiversity for vertebrates has been driven **not by competition** between organisms, 
> but by these animals adapting to **colonize empty livable space**; 
> this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.
