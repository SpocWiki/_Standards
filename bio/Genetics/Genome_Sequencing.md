> Whole **Genome Sequencing** (WGS) is the process of determining the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of the DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time. This entails sequencing all of an organism's chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast.
>
> Whole genome sequencing has largely been used as a research tool, but was being introduced to clinics in 2014. In the future of personalized medicine, whole genome sequence data may be an important tool to guide therapeutic intervention. The tool of gene sequencing at SNP level is also used to pinpoint functional variants from association studies and improve the knowledge available to researchers interested in evolutionary biology, and hence may lay the foundation for predicting disease susceptibility and drug response.
>
> Whole genome sequencing should not be confused with DNA profiling, which only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group, and does not contain additional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to specific diseases. In addition, whole genome sequencing should not be confused with methods that sequence specific subsets of the genome – such methods include whole exome sequencing (1–2% of the genome) or SNP genotyping (< 0.1% of the genome).

 ## Cost Reduction in Genome Sequencing

### Historical Cost Trend

The cost of genome sequencing has significantly decreased 
since the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2003. 
The first complete sequencing of a human genome cost approximately **2.7 billion USD** 
and took over a decade to complete (NHGRI, [genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov)). 
Since then, advancements in sequencing technology have led to an exponential decline in costs.

| Year | USD / Genome |
| ---- | -----------: |
| 2001 |        2.7e9 |
| 2007 |         10e6 |
| 2010 |         50e3 |
| 2015 |        1,5e3 |
| 2020 |          600 |
| 2023 |          200 |
| 2030 |          100 |

This decline by a factor of 13million is waaaay more than in [[../../../Knowledge/Technology.internal/Power_Plant/Solar_Power/Solar_Cell|Solar_Cell]]s, but not as much as in Computer . 

### Factors Driving Cost Reduction

#### **Technological Advances**

##### **1. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**

The shift from Sanger sequencing (used in the HGP) to NGS platforms, 
such as Illumina's sequencing-by-synthesis technology, enabled massive parallel sequencing. 
This increased throughput and reduced per-base costs by more than **99.9999** (NHGRI, [genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov)).

##### **2. Third-Generation Sequencing (TGS)**

TGS methods, such as **Oxford Nanopore** and **PacBio**, allow real-time sequencing of long DNA fragments, 
reducing costs associated with data processing and error correction.

##### **3. Automation and AI Integration**

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in genome assembly, error correction, 
and base calling has further reduced costs by improving efficiency and reducing computational overhead.

#### **Economies of Scale**

As sequencing demand increased, companies like **Illumina** and **BGI** achieved significant cost reductions 
through manufacturing efficiency, competition, and increased market size.

#### **Government and Private Investments**

Public initiatives like the **NHGRI's Advanced Sequencing Technology Program** 
and private investments from companies such as **Illumina, PacBio, and BGI** contributed to reducing costs.

### Projected Future Costs

With technologies like **Illumina's NovaSeq X** and **Oxford Nanopore's PromethION**, 
experts predict that sequencing costs could drop below **100 USD** by 2030. 
Some estimates suggest that ultra-high-throughput sequencing 
could make **10 USD genomes** feasible in research settings.

### Conclusion

Genome sequencing has transitioned from a multi-billion-dollar scientific endeavor 
to an affordable and scalable process, largely due to advancements in sequencing technologies, 
increased automation, and economies of scale. This cost reduction is expected to continue, making genomics more accessible for personalized medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.
