> Gregor Johann Mendel OSA (German: [ˈmɛndl̩]; Czech: Řehoř Jan Mendel; 
> 20 July 1822 – 6 January 1884) 
> was an Austrian biologist, meteorologist, mathematician, Augustinian friar 
> and abbot of St. Thomas' Abbey in Brno (Brünn), Margraviate of Moravia. 
> Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire 
> (today's Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition 
> as the founder of the modern science of genetics. 
> 
> Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants 
> could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments 
> conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, 
> now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.
>
> Mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: 
> plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. 
> 
> Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that 
> when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred, 
> their offspring always produced yellow seeds. 
> 
> However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. 
> To explain this phenomenon, 
> Mendel coined the terms "recessive" and "dominant" in reference to certain traits. 
> In the preceding example, the green trait, 
> which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive, 
> and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, 
> demonstrating the actions of invisible "factors"—now called genes—
> in predictably determining the traits of an organism. 
> The actual genes were only discovered in a long process that ended in 2025 
> when the last three of the seven Mendel genes were identified in the pea genome.
>
> The profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized 
> until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) 
> with the rediscovery of his laws. 
> 
> Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns 
> independently verified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, 
> ushering in the modern age of genetics.
