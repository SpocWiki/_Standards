## Cell Mechanisms for DNA and RNA Duplication

### DNA Duplication: Replication

The primary cell mechanism for duplicating DNA is called **DNA Replication**.  

1. **Process Overview**  
   DNA replication is a semi-conservative process where each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the production of the complementary strand. 

2. **Key Enzymes and Components**  
   - **DNA Polymerases**: Enzymes that synthesize new DNA strands by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand.
   - **Helicase**: Unwinds the DNA double helix to expose the template strands.
   - **Primase**: Synthesizes short RNA primers needed to initiate the synthesis of the new strand.
   - **Ligase**: Joins Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand to create a continuous DNA strand.

3. **Replication Fork**  
   Replication occurs at regions called replication forks, where the DNA double helix is unwound, and nucleotide chains are synthesized.

4. **Error Checking and Correction**  
   DNA polymerases have proofreading capabilities, correcting mismatched bases to reduce the error rate to about 1 mistake per 10 million nucleotides.

### Scientific Opinions and Evidence

While the basic principles are universally agreed upon, 
slight differences in replication and transcription exist among different organisms, 
such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

Eukaryotic cells, for example, have additional complexity 
due to the presence of histones and nucleosomes affecting DNA unwinding.

### Error Rates: errors per base pair per replication

| Replication stage     | Error rate value      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Base selection only   | 1 × 10⁻⁵              |
| After proofreading    | 1 × 10⁻⁷              |
| After mismatch repair | 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ to 1 × 10⁻⁹ |

In humans, the diploid genome contains approximately 6.4 × 10⁹ base pairs.  
At an error rate of 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ errors per base pair per replication, 
this corresponds to roughly 0.64 errors per cell division, 
meaning fewer than 1 new mutation per genome per replication cycle on average.

1. **Replication**: Despite proofreading, some errors occur, contributing to genetic variation and potential mutations. 
2. **Transcription**: While not as accurate as replication, 
   errors in transcription are generally **less critical since RNA is not heritable** 
   and errors can be corrected through processes such as splicing and degradation.
