> In molecular biology, messenger ribonucleic acid (**mRNA**) 
> is a single-stranded molecule of RNA that corresponds to the genetic sequence of a gene, 
> and is read by a ribosome in the process of synthesizing a protein.
>
> mRNA is created during the process of transcription, 
> where an enzyme (RNA polymerase) converts the gene into primary transcript mRNA (AKA pre-mRNA). 
> This pre-mRNA usually still contains introns, 
> regions that will not go on to code for the final amino acid sequence. 
> These are removed in the process of RNA splicing, leaving only exons, regions that will encode the protein. 
> This exon sequence constitutes mature mRNA. 
> Mature mRNA is then read by the ribosome, 
> and the ribosome creates the protein utilizing amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA). 
> This process is known as translation. 
> All of these processes form part of the central dogma of molecular biology, 
> which describes the flow of genetic information in a biological system.
>
> As in DNA, genetic information in mRNA is contained in the sequence of nucleotides, 
> which are arranged into codons consisting of three ribonucleotides each. 
> Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. 
> The translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: 
> transfer RNA, which recognizes the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, 
> and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing machinery.

> The concept of mRNA was developed by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick in 1960 
> during a conversation with FranÃ§ois Jacob. 
> In 1961, mRNA was identified and described independently by one team consisting of Brenner, Jacob, 
> and Matthew Meselson, and another team led by James Watson. 
> While analyzing the data in preparation for publication, 
> Jacob and Jacques Monod coined the name "messenger RNA".
