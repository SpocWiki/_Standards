## Process of Transcription. 

1. **Process Overview**  
   During transcription, a segment of DNA is read by RNA polymerase, generating a complementary RNA strand known as messenger RNA (mRNA).

2. **Key Enzymes and Components**  
   - **RNA Polymerase**: Catalyzes the synthesis of RNA from the DNA template.
   - **Promoter Regions**: Specific DNA sequences where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.
   - **Termination Signals**: DNA sequences signaling the end of transcription.

3. **Transcription Factor**  
   A protein that assists in the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter and the subsequent initiation of transcription.
