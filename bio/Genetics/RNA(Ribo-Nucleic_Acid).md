> Ribonucleic acid (**RNA**) is a polymeric molecule that is essential for most biological functions, 
> either by performing the function itself (non-coding RNA) 
> or by forming a template for the production of proteins (messenger RNA). 
> 
> RNA and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are nucleic acids. 
> The nucleic acids constitute one of the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. 
> RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides. 
> Cellular organisms use [[mRNA(messenger_RNA)]] to convey genetic information 
> (using the nitrogenous bases of guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine, denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) 
> that directs synthesis of specific proteins. 
> Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.
>
> Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, 
> controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. 
> 
> One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function 
> in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of proteins on ribosomes. 
> This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, 
> where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form coded proteins.
>
> It has become widely accepted in science that early in the history of life on Earth, 
> prior to the evolution of DNA and possibly of protein-based enzymes as well, an "RNA world" existed 
> in which RNA served as both living organisms' storage method for genetic information—
> a role fulfilled today by DNA, except in the case of RNA viruses—
> and potentially performed catalytic functions in cells—
> a function performed today by protein enzymes, 
> with the notable and important exception of the ribosome, which is a ribozyme.
