> In vascular plants, the **Root**s are the organs of a plant 
> that are modified to provide anchorage for the plant 
> and take in water and nutrients into the plant body, 
> which allows plants to grow taller and faster. 
> 
> They are most often below the surface of the soil, 
> but roots can also be aerial or aerating, 
> that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water.
