> Plant hormones (or phytohormones) are signal molecules, produced within plants, 
> that occur in extremely low concentrations. 
> 
> Plant hormones control all aspects of plant growth and development, 
> including embryogenesis, the regulation of organ size, pathogen defense, stress tolerance 
> and reproductive development. 
> 
> Unlike in animals (in which hormone production is restricted to specialized glands) 
> each plant cell is capable of producing hormones. 
> Went and Thimann coined the term "phytohormone" and used it in the title of their 1937 book.
>
> Phytohormones occur across the plant kingdom, and even in algae, 
> where they have similar functions to those seen in vascular plants ("higher plants"). 
> 
> Some phytohormones also occur in microorganisms, such as unicellular fungi and bacteria, 
> however in these cases they do not play a hormonal role 
> and can better be regarded as secondary metabolites.
