> The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular. 
> It can be divided into three types based on the nature of the cell walls. 
> This tissue system is present between the dermal tissue 
> and forms the main bulk of the plant body.
>
> Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature. 
> Parenchyma forms the "filler" tissue in the soft parts of plants, 
> and is usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith, and medullary rays in primary stem and root.
>
> Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening. 
> Collenchyma provides extra mechanical and structural support, 
> particularly in regions of new growth.
>
> **Sclerenchyma** cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature. 
> Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to the plant.
>
> Aerenchyma cells are found in aquatic plants. 
> They are also known to be parenchyma cells 
> with large air cavities surrounded by irregular cells which form columns called trabeculae.
