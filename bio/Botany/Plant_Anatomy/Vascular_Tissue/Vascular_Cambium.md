> The vascular cambium is the main growth tissue in the stems and roots of many plants 
> exhibiting secondary growth, specifically in dicots such as buttercups and oak trees, 
> gymnosperms such as pine trees, as well as in certain other vascular plants. 
> 
> It produces secondary xylem inwards, towards the pith, 
> and secondary phloem outwards, towards the bark. 
> Generally, more secondary xylem is produced than secondary phloem.
>
> In herbaceous plants, it occurs in the vascular bundles 
> which are often arranged like beads on a necklace 
> forming an interrupted ring inside the stem. 
> 
> In woody plants, it forms a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells, 
> as a continuous ring from which the new tissues are grown. 
> Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant. 
> 
> Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, 
> wood cambium, or bifacial cambium.
