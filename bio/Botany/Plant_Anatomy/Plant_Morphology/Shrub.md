> A **Shrub** or bush is a small to medium-sized perennial woody plant. 
> Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. 
> Shrubs can be either deciduous or evergreen. 
> 
> They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6–10 m (20–33 ft) tall. 
> Small shrubs, less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall are sometimes termed as subshrubs.
>
> Some define a shrub as less than 6 m (20 ft) and a tree as over 6 m tall. 
> Others use 10 m (33 ft) as the cutoff point for classification. 
> 
> Many trees do not reach this mature height because of hostile, 
> less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble shrub-sized plants. 
> 
> Others in such species have the potential to grow taller in ideal conditions. 
> Some only last about five years in good conditions. 
> Others, usually larger and more woody, live beyond 70 years. 
> On average, they die after eight years.
>
> Shrubland is the natural landscape dominated by various shrubs; 
> there are many distinct types around the world, including 
> fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland. 
> 
> In gardens and parks, an area largely dedicated to shrubs 
> (now less fashionable than a century ago) is called a shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden. 
> There are many garden cultivars of shrubs, bred for flowering, 
> for example rhododendrons, and sometimes even leaf colour or shape.
>
> Apart from the several berry-bearing shrub species 
> (using the culinary rather than botanical definition), 
> few are eaten directly, and they are generally too small for much timber use unlike trees. 
> 
> Those that are used include several perfumed species such as lavender and rose, 
> and a wide range of plants with medicinal uses. 
> 
> Tea and coffee are on the tree-shrub boundary; 
> they are normally harvested from shrub-sized plants, 
> but these would be large enough to become small trees if left to grow instead.
