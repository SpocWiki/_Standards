## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Transpiration** is the process of water movement through a plant 
> and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. 
> 
> It is a passive process that requires no energy expense by the plant. 
> Transpiration also cools plants, changes osmotic pressure of cells, 
> and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients. 
> 
> When water uptake by the roots is 
> less than the water lost to the atmosphere by evaporation, 
> plants close small pores called [[Transpiration/Stomata|Stomata]] to decrease water loss, 
> which slows down nutrient uptake and decreases CO2 absorption from the atmosphere 
> limiting metabolic processes, photosynthesis, and growth.
