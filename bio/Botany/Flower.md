## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Flower**, also known as a bloom or blossom, 
> is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). 
> 
> Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ 
> sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. 
> 
> Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, 
> which in flowering plants produce gametes. 
> The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, 
> are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. 
> 
> The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary. 
> In some plants, multiple flowers occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), 
> and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle (inflorescence stalk).
>
> Most flowering plants depend on animals, 
> such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, 
> and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, 
> including brightly colored, large petals with patterns only visible to under ultraviolet light, 
> attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators. 
> 
> In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators 
> to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one anotherâ€”
> in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.
>
> When pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma to another, it is called pollination. 
> Some flowers may self-pollinate, 
> producing seed using pollen from a different flower of the same plant, 
> but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, 
> when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower 
> on a different individual of the same species. 
> 
> Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, 
> and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. 
> This pollination does not require an investment from the plant 
> to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. 
> Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). 
> After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
>
> Flowers have long been appreciated for their beauty and pleasant scents, 
> and also hold cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, 
> or sources of medicine and food.
