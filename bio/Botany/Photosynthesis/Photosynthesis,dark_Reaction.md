> The **Calvin cycle**, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, 
> dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis 
> is a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide 
> and hydrogen-carrier compounds into glucose. 
> 
> The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes 
> and also many photosynthetic bacteria. 
> 
> In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, 
> the fluid-filled region of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. 
> 
> These reactions 
> take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions 
> and perform further chemical processes on them. 
> 
> The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP 
> and the reducing power of NADPH from the light-dependent reactions 
> to produce sugars for the plant to use. 
> 
> These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions 
> to produce sugars in a step-wise process; 
> 
> there is no direct reaction that converts several molecules of CO2 to a sugar. 
> There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, 
> collectively called the Calvin cycle: 
> - carboxylation, 
> - reduction reactions, and 
> - ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.
>
> Though it is also called the "dark reaction", 
> the Calvin cycle does not occur in the dark or during nighttime. 
> 
> This is because the process requires NADPH, 
> which is short-lived and comes from light-dependent reactions. 
> 
> In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem 
> from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant. 
> 
> The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available 
> independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)); 
> 
> CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night 
> and release it by day to make this process work.
