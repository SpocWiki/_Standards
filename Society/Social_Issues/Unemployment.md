## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Unemployment** is the state not being in paid employment or self-employment 
> but currently available for work. 
> 
> Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, 
> which is the number of people who are unemployed 
> as a percentage of the labour force 
> (the total number of people employed above a specified age 
> added to those unemployed) during the reference period.
>
> Unemployment can have many sources, such as the following:
> - the status of the economy, which can be influenced by a recession
> - competition caused by globalization and international trade
> - new technologies and inventions
> - policies of the government
> - regulation and market
> - war, civil disorder, and natural disasters
>
> Unemployment and the status of the economy can be influenced by a country 
> through, for example, fiscal policy. 
> 
> Furthermore, the monetary authority of a country, such as the central bank, 
> can influence the availability and cost for money through its monetary policy.
>
> In addition to theories of unemployment, 
> a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely 
> modelling the effects of unemployment within the economic system. 
> 
> Some of the main types of unemployment include 
> - structural unemployment, 
> - frictional unemployment, 
> - cyclical unemployment, 
> - involuntary unemployment and 
> - classical unemployment. 
> 
> Structural unemployment focuses on foundational problems in the economy 
> and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, 
> including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skills. 
> 
> Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions 
> related to disruptive technologies and globalization. 
> 
> Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work 
> based on individuals' valuation of their own work 
> and how that compares to current wage rates 
> added to the time and effort required to find a job. 
> 
> Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment 
> often address job entry threshold and wage rates.
>
> According to the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO), 
> there were 172 million people worldwide without work in 2018.
> (5% of the reported global workforce) 
>
> Because of the difficulty in measuring the unemployment rate by, for example, 
> using surveys (as in the United States) 
> or through registered unemployed citizens (as in some European countries), 
> statistical figures such as the employment-to-population ratio 
> might be more suitable for evaluating the status of the workforce and the economy 
> if they were based on people who are registered, for example, as taxpayers.
