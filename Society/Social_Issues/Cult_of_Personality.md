> A cult of personality, or a cult of the leader, is the result of an effort which is made 
> to create an idealized and heroic image of an admirable leader, 
> often through unquestioning flattery and praise. 
> 
> Historically, it has been developed through techniques such as the 
> - manipulation of the mass media, 
> - the dissemination of propaganda, 
> - the staging of spectacles, 
> - the manipulation of the arts, 
> - the instilling of patriotism, and 
> - government-organized demonstrations and rallies. 
> 
> A cult of personality is similar to apotheosis, except that 
> it is established through the use of modern social engineering techniques, 
> it is usually established by the state or the party in one-party states and dominant-party states. 
> 
> Cults of personality often accompany the leaders of totalitarian or authoritarian governments. 
> They can also be seen in some monarchies, theocracies, failed democracies, and even in liberal democracies.
