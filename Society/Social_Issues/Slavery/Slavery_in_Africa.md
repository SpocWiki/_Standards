## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Slavery has historically been widespread in Africa. 
> Systems of servitude and slavery were once commonplace in parts of Africa, 
> as they were in much of the rest of the ancient and medieval world. 
> 
> When the trans-Saharan slave trade, Red Sea slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade 
> and Atlantic slave trade (which started in the 16th century) began, 
> many of the pre-existing local African slave systems 
> began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa. 
> 
> Slavery in contemporary Africa still exists in some regions despite being illegal.
>
> In the relevant literature, African slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery, depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the continent. Slavery in historical Africa was practiced in many different forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery, slavery for prostitution and enslavement of criminals were all practiced in various parts of Africa. Slavery for domestic and court purposes was widespread throughout Africa. Plantation slavery also occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of West Africa. The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased during the 19th century. Due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, many African states that were dependent on the international slave trade reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave labour.
