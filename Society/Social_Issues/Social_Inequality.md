## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Social inequality occurs when resources within a society are distributed unevenly, 
> often as a result of inequitable allocation practices 
> that create distinct unequal patterns based on socially defined categories of people. 
> 
> Differences in accessing social goods within society are influenced by factors like 
> power, religion, kinship, prestige, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, intelligence and class. 
> 
> Social inequality usually implies the lack of equality of outcome, 
> but may alternatively be conceptualized as a lack of equality in access to opportunity. 
>
> Social inequality is linked to economic inequality, 
> usually described as the basis of the unequal distribution of income or wealth. 
> 
> Although the disciplines of economics and sociology generally use different theoretical approaches to examine and explain economic inequality, both fields are actively involved in researching this inequality. However, social and natural resources other than purely economic resources are also unevenly distributed in most societies and may contribute to social status. Norms of allocation can also affect the distribution of rights and privileges, social power, access to public goods such as education or the judicial system, adequate housing, transportation, credit and financial services such as banking and other social goods and services.
>
> Social inequality is shaped by a range of structural factors, such as geographical location or citizenship status, and is often underpinned by cultural discourses and identities defining, for example, whether the poor are 'deserving' or 'undeserving'. Understanding the process of social inequality highlights the importance of how society values its people and identifies significant aspects of how biases manifest within society.
