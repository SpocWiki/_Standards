> Debt bondage, also known as debt slavery, bonded labour, or peonage, 
> is the pledge of a person's services as security for the 
> repayment for a debt or other obligation. 
> 
> Where the terms of the repayment are not clearly or reasonably stated, 
> or where the debt is excessively large, 
> the person who holds the debt has thus some control over the laborer, 
> whose freedom depends on the undefined or excessive debt repayment. 
> 
> The services required to repay the debt may be undefined, 
> and the services' duration may be undefined, 
> thus allowing the person supposedly owed the debt to demand services indefinitely. 
> 
> Debt bondage can be **passed on from generation to generation**.
>
> In 2021, the International Labour Organization estimated that, 
> of the 27.6 million people currently participating in forced labour, 
> 20.9%, or about 5.8 million, were in debt bondage. 
> 
> Debt bondage has been described by the United Nations as 
> a form of "modern day slavery", and the 
> Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery seeks to abolish the practice.
>
> The practice is still prevalent primarily in South Asia 
> and parts of Western and Southern Africa, although most countries in these regions 
> are parties to the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery. 
> 
> Lack of prosecution or insufficient punishment of this crime 
> are the leading causes of the practice as it exists at this scale today.
