> Sustainable development is an approach to growth and human development 
> that aims to meet the needs of the present 
> without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 
> 
> The aim is to have a society where living conditions and resources meet human needs 
> without undermining planetary integrity. 
> 
> Sustainable development aims to balance the needs of the economy, 
> environment, and society. 
> The Brundtland Report in 1987 helped 
> to make the concept of sustainable development better known.
>
> Sustainable development overlaps with the idea of sustainability which is a normative concept. 
> UNESCO formulated a distinction between the two concepts as follows: 
> "Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), 
> while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it."
>
> The Rio Process that began at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 
> has placed the concept of sustainable development on the international agenda. 
> 
> Sustainable development is the foundational concept of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
> These global goals for the year 2030 
> were adopted in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). 
> They address the global challenges, including poverty, climate change, biodiversity loss, and peace.
>
> There are some problems with the concept of sustainable development. 
> Some scholars say it is an oxymoron 
> because according to them, development is inherently unsustainable. 
> 
> Other commentators are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far. 
> Scholars have stated that "sustainable development" is 
> open-ended, ambiguous, and incoherent, so it can be easily appropriated. 
> 
> Furthermore, while digitalization is often promoted as a tool for sustainable development, 
> recent scholarly analysis has introduced a more complex view, 
> indicating that the rapid reliance on digital technologies 
> can have a negative overall impact on environmental sustainability, 
> despite positive influences on economic and social development aspects. 
> 
> Therefore, it is important that there is increased funding for research on sustainability 
> in order to better understand sustainable development and address its vagueness and shortcomings.
