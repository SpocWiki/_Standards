> The harm principle holds that the actions of individuals should be limited only 
> to prevent harm to other individuals. 
> 
> John Stuart Mill articulated the principle in the 1859 essay On Liberty, where he argued that 
> "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."  
> 
> An equivalent was earlier stated in France's 
> Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 as, 
> "Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; 
> hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits 
> except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law." 
> 
> It finds earlier expression in Thomas Jefferson's 1785 "Notes on the State of Virginia", 
> Query 17 (Religion) in which he writes, "The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others."
