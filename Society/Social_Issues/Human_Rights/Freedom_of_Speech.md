## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community 
> to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. 
> The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in 
> - the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and 
> - international human rights law. 
> 
> Many countries have constitutional laws that protect freedom of speech. 
> Terms such as free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression 
> are often used interchangeably in political discourse. 
> However, in legal contexts, freedom of expression more broadly encompasses 
> the right to seek, receive, and impart information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.
>
> Article 19 of the UDHR states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals".
>
> Therefore, freedom of speech and expression may not be recognized as absolute. 
> Common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to 
> - libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, blasphemy and perjury. 
> Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, 
> which suggests that "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others".
>
> The "offense principle" is also used to justify speech limitations, 
> describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, 
> considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, 
> and ease with which it could be avoided.
>
> With the evolution of the digital age, new means of communication emerged. 
> However, these means are also subject to new restrictions. 
> Countries or organizations may use internet censorship to block undesirable or illegal material. 
> Social media platforms frequently use content moderation 
> to filter or remove user-generated content that is deemed against the terms of service, 
> even if that content is not illegal.
