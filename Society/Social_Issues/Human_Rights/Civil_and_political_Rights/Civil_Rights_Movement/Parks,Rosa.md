> Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) 
> was an American civil rights activist. 
> 
> She is best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, 
> in defiance of Jim Crow racial segregation laws, in 1955, 
> which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. 
> She is sometimes known as the "mother of the civil rights movement".
>
> Born in Tuskegee, Alabama, Parks grew up under Jim Crow segregation. 
> She later moved to Montgomery and joined the city's chapter of 
> the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1943, 
> serving as the organization's secretary. 
> 
> Despite policies designed to disenfranchise Black citizens, 
> Parks successfully registered to vote after three separate attempts between 1943 and 1945. 
> She investigated cases and organized campaigns around cases of racial and sexual violence 
> in her capacity as NAACP secretary, including those of Recy Taylor and Jeremiah Reeves, 
> laying the groundwork for future civil rights campaigns.
>
> Custom in Montgomery required Black passengers 
> to surrender their seats in the front of the bus to accommodate white riders. 
> The rows in the back were designated for Black riders. 
> 
> Prior to Parks's refusal to move, several Black Montgomerians had refused to do so, 
> leading to arrests. 
> When Parks was arrested in 1955, local leaders were searching for 
> a person who would be a good legal test case against segregation. 
> She was deemed a suitable candidate, and the Women's Political Council (WPC) 
> organized a one-day bus boycott on the day of her trial. 
> The boycott was widespread. 
> 
> Many Black Montgomerians refused to ride the buses that day. 
> After Parks was found guilty of violating state law, the boycott was extended indefinitely, 
> the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) 
> organizing its own community transportation network to sustain it. 
> Parks and other boycott leaders faced harassment, ostracization, and legal obstacles. 
> The boycott lasted for 381 days, finally concluding 
> after segregation on buses was deemed unconstitutional in the court case Browder v. Gayle.
>
> Parks faced both financial hardship and health problems 
> as a result of her participation in the boycott, and in 1957, she relocated to Detroit, Michigan. 
> She continued to advocate for civil rights, providing support for individuals such as 
> John Conyers, Joanne Little, Gary Tyler, Angela Davis, Joe Madison, and Nelson Mandela. 
> 
> She was also a supporter of the Black power movement and an anti-apartheid activist, 
> participating in protests and conferences as part of the Free South Africa Movement. 
> 
> In 1987, she co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development 
> with Elaine Eason Steele. 
> 
> After Parks's death in 2005, she was honored with public viewings 
> and memorial services in three cities: 
> - in Montgomery; 
> - in Washington, D.C., where she lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda; and 
> - in Detroit, where she was ultimately interred at Woodlawn Cemetery. 
> 
> Parks received many awards and honors, both throughout her life and posthumously. 
> She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a Congressional Gold Medal, 
> and was also the first Black American to be memorialized in the National Statuary Hall.
