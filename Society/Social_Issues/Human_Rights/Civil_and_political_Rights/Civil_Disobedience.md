> Civil disobedience is the active and professed refusal of a citizen 
> to obey certain laws, demands, orders, or commands of a government (or any other authority). 
> 
> By some definitions, civil disobedience has to be nonviolent to be called "civil". 
> Hence, civil disobedience is sometimes equated with peaceful protests or nonviolent resistance. 
> Henry David Thoreau's essay Resistance to Civil Government, first published in 1849 
> and then published posthumously in 1866 as Civil Disobedience,
> popularized the term in the US, although the concept itself was practiced long before this work. 
>
> Various forms of civil disobedience have been used by prominent activists, such as American women's suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony in the late 19th century, Egyptian nationalist Saad Zaghloul during the 1910s, and Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi in 1920s British India as part of his leadership of the Indian independence movement. Martin Luther King Jr.'s and James Bevel's peaceful nonviolent protests during the civil rights movement in the 1960s United States sometimes contained important aspects of civil disobedience. Although civil disobedience is rarely justifiable in court, King regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law: "Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law."
