## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Civil and political rights** are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom 
> from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. 
> They ensure one's entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of society and the state.
>
> Civil rights generally include ensuring peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, 
> and safety, protection from discrimination, the right to privacy, 
> the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.
>
> Political rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, 
> such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; 
> the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; 
> and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, 
> the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote. 
> 
> These rights also must follow the legal norm as in they must have the force of law 
> and fit into the system of administrative justice. 
> A key feature in modern society is that the more a state can guarantee political rights of citizens 
> the better the states relations are with its citizens.
>
> Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights. 
> They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be "first-generation rights", and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.
