> On 26 April 1986, the no. 4 reactor of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, 
> located near Pripyat, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (now Ukraine), exploded. 
> 
> With dozens of direct casualties, it is one of only two nuclear energy accidents 
> rated at the maximum severity on the International Nuclear Event Scale, 
> the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. 
> 
> The response involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles 
> (about $84.5 billion USD in 2025). 
> It remains the worst nuclear disaster and the most expensive disaster in history, 
> with an estimated cost of US$700 billion.
>
> The disaster occurred while running a test 
> to simulate cooling the reactor during an accident in blackout conditions. 
> The operators carried out the test despite an accidental drop in reactor power, 
> and due to a design issue, attempting to shut down the reactor in those conditions 
> resulted in a dramatic power surge. 
> 
> The reactor components ruptured and lost coolants, 
> and the resulting steam explosions and meltdown destroyed the Reactor building no. 4, 
> followed by a reactor core fire 
> that spread radioactive contaminants across the Soviet Union and Europe. 
> A 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) exclusion zone was established 36 hours after the accident, 
> initially evacuating around 49,000 people. 
> The exclusion zone was later expanded to 30 kilometres (19 mi), 
> resulting in the evacuation of approximately 68,000 more people.
>
> Following the explosion, which killed two engineers and severely burned two others, 
> an emergency operation began to put out the fires and stabilize the reactor. 
> Of the 237 workers hospitalized, 134 showed symptoms of acute radiation syndrome (ARS); 
> 28 of them died within three months. 
> Over the next decade, 14 more workers (nine of whom had ARS) died of various causes 
> mostly unrelated to radiation exposure. 
> 
> It is the only instance in commercial nuclear power history 
> where radiation-related fatalities occurred. 
> As of 2005, 6000 cases of childhood thyroid cancer occurred within the affected populations, 
> "a large fraction" being attributed to the disaster. 
> The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation 
> estimates fewer than 100 deaths have resulted from the fallout. 
> 
> Predictions of the eventual total death toll vary; 
> a 2006 World Health Organization study projected 9,000 cancer-related fatalities in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
>
> Pripyat was abandoned and replaced by the purpose-built city of Slavutych. 
> The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus, completed in December 1986, 
> reduced the spread of radioactive contamination 
> and provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors. 
> In 2016–2018, the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement was constructed around the old sarcophagus 
> to enable the removal of the reactor debris, with clean-up scheduled for completion by 2065.
