> [[../../bio/Metabolism/Nutrition/Malnutrition|malnutrition]], starvation, epidemic, and increased mortality. 
> 
> Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. 
> During the 19th and 20th centuries, Southeast and South Asia, 
> as well as Eastern and Central Europe, suffered the greatest number of fatalities due to famine. 
> 
> Deaths caused by famine declined sharply beginning in the 1970s, with numbers falling further since 2000. 
> Since 2010, [[../../Earth/Continent/Africa|Africa]] has been the most affected continent in the world by famine.
