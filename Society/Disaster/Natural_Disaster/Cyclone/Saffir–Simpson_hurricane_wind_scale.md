# [[Saffir–Simpson_hurricane_wind_scale]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) is a tropical cyclone intensity scale 
> that classifies hurricanes—which in the Western Hemisphere are tropical cyclones 
> that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms—
> into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. 
> This measuring system was formerly known as the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, or SSHS.
>
> To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have one-minute-average 
> maximum sustained winds at 10 m (33 ft) above the surface of at least 74 mph (64 kn, 119 km/h; Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, 
> Category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph (137 kn, 252 km/h). 
> The classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding 
> a hurricane will cause upon landfall.
>
> The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale is based on the highest wind speed 
> averaged over a one-minute interval 10 m above the surface. 
> 
> Although the scale shows wind speeds in continuous speed ranges, 
> the US National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 
> assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5-knot (kn) increments (e.g., 100, 105, 110, 115 kn, etc.) 
> because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating the strength of tropical cyclones. 
> Wind speeds in knots are then converted to other units 
> and rounded to the nearest 5 mph or 5 km/h.
>
> The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale is used officially only to describe hurricanes 
> that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line. 
> 
> Other areas use different scales to label these storms, 
> which are called cyclones or typhoons, depending on the area. 
> These areas (except the JTWC) use three-minute or ten-minute averaged winds 
> to determine the maximum sustained wind speed, 
> creating an important difference which frustrates direct comparison 
> between maximum wind speeds of storms measured using the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (usually 14% more intense) 
> and those measured using a ten-minute interval (usually 12% less intense).
>
> There is some criticism of the SSHWS for not accounting for rain, storm surge, 
> and other important factors, but SSHWS defenders say that part of the goal of SSHWS is 
> to be straightforward and simple to understand. 
> 
> There have been proposals for the addition of higher categories to the scale, 
> which would then set a maximum cutoff for Category 5, 
> but none have been adopted as of October 2025.
