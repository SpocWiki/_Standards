> An **Avalanche** is a rapid flow of snow down a slope, such as a hill or mountain. 
> Avalanches can be triggered 
> - spontaneously, by factors such as increased precipitation or snowpack weakening, 
> - or by external means such as humans, other animals, and earthquakes. 
> Primarily composed of flowing snow and air, 
> large avalanches have the capability to capture and move ice, rocks, and trees.
>
> Avalanches occur in two general forms, or combinations thereof: 
> slab avalanches made of tightly packed snow, triggered by a collapse of an underlying weak snow layer, 
> and loose snow avalanches made of looser snow. 
> After being set off, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly 
> and grow in mass and volume as they capture more snow. 
> 
> If an avalanche moves fast enough, some of the snow may mix with the air, 
> forming a powder snow avalanche.
>
> Though they appear to share similarities, avalanches 
> are distinct from slush flows, mudslides, rock slides, and serac collapses. 
> They are also different from large scale movements of ice. 
> Avalanches can happen in any mountain range that has an enduring snowpack. 
> They are most frequent in winter or spring, but may occur at any time of the year. 
> 
> In mountainous areas, avalanches are among the most serious natural hazards to life and property, 
> so great efforts are made in avalanche control. 
> There are many classification systems for the different forms of avalanches. 
> Avalanches can be described by their size, destructive potential, initiation mechanism, composition, 
> and dynamics.
