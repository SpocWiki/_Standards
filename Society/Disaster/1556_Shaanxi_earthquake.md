> The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake (Postal romanization: Shensi), known in Chinese colloquially by its regnal year as the 
> Jiajing Great Earthquake "嘉靖大地震" (Jiājìng Dàdìzhèn) 
> or officially by its epicenter as the Hua County Earthquake "华县地震" (Huàxiàn Dìzhèn), 
> occurred in the early morning of 2 February 1556 in Huaxian, Shaanxi, during the Ming dynasty.
>
> Most of the residents there lived in yaodongs—artificial caves in loess cliffs—
> which collapsed and buried alive those sleeping inside. 
> 
> Modern estimates by China Earthquake Administration's publications 
> put the direct deaths from the earthquake at roughly 100,000, 
> while over 700,000 either migrated away or died from famine and plagues, 
> which summed up to a total reduction of 830,000 people in Imperial hukou registration. 
> It is one of the deadliest earthquakes and one of the deadliest natural disasters in Chinese history.
