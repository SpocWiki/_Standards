> The 1931 China floods, or the 1931 Yangtze–Huai River floods, 
> was a devastating flood that occurred from June to August 1931 in China, 
> hitting major cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing and beyond, 
> and eventually culminated in a dike breach along Lake Gaoyou on 25 August 1931.
>
> Fatality estimates vary widely. 
> A field survey by the University of Nanking led by John Lossing Buck immediately after the flood found 
> "150,000 people had drowned, and that this number represented 
> less than a quarter of all fatalities during the first 100 days of the flood." 
> 
> The official report found 140,000 drowned and claims that 
> "2 million people died during the flood, having drowned or died from lack of food". 
> 
> A cholera epidemic in the subsequent year, from May 1932, 
> was officially reported to have 31,974 deaths and 100,666 cases.
