> The 1970 Bhola cyclone (also known as the Great Cyclone of 1970) 
> was a catastrophic and extremely deadly tropical cyclone 
> that struck East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and India's West Bengal on 12 November 1970. 
> 
> It remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the world's deadliest humanitarian disasters. 
> At least 300,000 people died in the storm, possibly as many as 450,000, 
> primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the Ganges Delta. 
> Bhola was the sixth and strongest cyclonic storm of the 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.
>
> The cyclone formed over the central Bay of Bengal on 8 November and traveled northward, intensifying as it did so. It reached its peak with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on 10 November, and made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan on the following afternoon. The storm surge devastated many of the offshore islands, wiping out villages and destroying crops throughout the region. In the most severely affected upazila Tazumuddin, over 45% of the population of 167,000 were killed by the storm.
>
> The Pakistani government, led by junta leader General Yahya Khan, was criticized for its delayed handling of relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and by the international media. The poor and discriminatory response from the West Pakistan government led to the increasingly widespread disillusionment from the East Pakistani people, allowing the opposition Awami League to gain a landslide victory in the province during the election that took place a month later as well as the Bangladesh Liberation War 7 months later.
