> The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon earthquake, 
> impacted Portugal, the Iberian Peninsula, and Northwest Africa 
> on the morning of Saturday, 1 November, Feast of All Saints, at around 09:40 local time. 
> 
> In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, 
> the earthquake almost completely destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. 
> 
> Seismologists estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 or greater on the moment magnitude scale, 
> with its epicenter in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 km (110 nmi; 120 mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent, 
> a cape in Algarve region, and about 290 km (160 nmi; 180 mi) southwest of Lisbon.
>
> Chronologically, it was the third known large-scale earthquake to hit the city (following those of 1332 and 1531). 
> Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon around 30,000â€“40,000. A further 10,000 may have died in Morocco.
>
> The earthquake accentuated political tensions in Portugal and profoundly disrupted the Portuguese Empire. 
> The event was widely discussed and dwelt upon by European Enlightenment philosophers, 
> and inspired major developments in theodicy. 
> 
> As the first earthquake studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, 
> it led to the birth of modern seismology and earthquake engineering.
