> On 4 August 2020, a major explosion occurred in Beirut, Lebanon, 
> triggered by the ignition of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. 
> 
> The chemical, confiscated in 2014 from the cargo ship MV Rhosus 
> and stored at the Port of Beirut without adequate safety measures for six years, 
> detonated after a fire broke out in a nearby warehouse. 
> 
> The explosion resulted in at least 218 fatalities, 7,000 injuries, 
> and approximately 300,000 displaced individuals, 
> alongside property damage estimated at US$15 billion. 
> 
> The blast released energy comparable to 1.1 kilotons of TNT, 
> ranking it among the most powerful non-nuclear explosions ever recorded 
> and the largest single detonation of ammonium nitrate.
>
> The explosion generated a seismic event measuring 3.3 in magnitude, 
> as reported by the United States Geological Survey. 
> Its effects were felt in Lebanon and neighboring regions, 
> including Syria, Israel, and Cyprus, over 240 km (150 mi) away. 
> 
> Scientific studies noted that the shockwave temporarily disrupted Earth's ionosphere. Adjacent grain silos at the Port of Beirut sustained major damage. Portions of the silos collapsed in July and August 2022 following fires caused by remaining grain stocks.
>
> The Lebanese government declared a two-week state of emergency in response to the disaster. Protests, which had been ongoing since 2019, grew in scale, leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his cabinet on 10 August 2020. Claims surfaced suggesting Hezbollah's possible connection to the explosion, citing unverified reports of weapons stored at the site. Hezbollah denied the allegations but participated in demonstrations opposing the official investigation.
