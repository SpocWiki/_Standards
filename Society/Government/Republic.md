# [[Republic]] 

Republic focuses on __structures and legal frameworks that guide how power is exercised and limited__.

A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" 
(from the Latin _res publica_ ), and is not the private concern or property of the rulers. 
This includes that __any decision can be questioned by the Public__. 
The head of state is usually an elected or appointed president, not a monarch.

Most modern democracies are also republics. 
They blend the principles of democracy (elections and majority rule) 
with those of a republic (constitutional protections for individual rights).

In summary, while both terms relate to systems where power ultimately resides with the people, 
- [[Democracy]] focuses on how decisions are made (through direct or representative participation), and 
- [[Republic]] focuses on the structures and legal frameworks that guide how power is exercised and limited. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Republic**, based on the Latin phrase res publica ('public affair'), 
> is a state in which political power rests with the public through their  representatives—
> in contrast to a [[Monarchy]] or [[../../../_protect/Society/Sociology/Politics/Aristocracy]] .
>
> Representation in a republic may or may not be freely elected by the general citizenry. 
> In many historical republics, representation has been based on personal status 
> and the role of elections has been limited. This remains true today; 
> among the 159 states that use the word republic in their official names as of 2017, 
> are states that narrowly constrain both the right of representation and the process of election.
>
> The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting 
> - from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC 
> - to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. 
> 
> This constitution was characterized by 
> - a [[Roman_Senate]] composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; 
> - a series of [[Roman_Magistrate]]s with varying types of civil and political authority.
> - and several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates from the populace and pass laws; 
>
> Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, 
> but there are also subnational state entities that are referred to as republics, 
> or that have governments that are described as republican in nature.
