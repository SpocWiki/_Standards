> The **Roman magistrate**s (Latin: magistratus) were elected officials in ancient Rome. 
> During the period of the Roman Kingdom, the King of Rome was the principal executive magistrate. 
> His power, in practice, was absolute. He was the chief priest, lawgiver, judge, and the sole commander of the army. 
> When the king died, his power reverted to the Roman Senate, 
> which then chose an Interrex to facilitate the election of a new king.
>
> During the transition from the Roman Kingdom to Roman Republic, 
> the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman king to the Roman Senate. 
> 
> When the Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC, 
> the powers that had been held by the king were transferred to the Roman consuls, 
> of which two were to be elected each year. 
> 
> Magistrates of the republic were elected by the people of Rome, 
> and were each vested with a degree of power called "major powers" (maior potestas). 
> 
> Dictators had more "major powers" than any other magistrate, and 
> after the dictator was the censor, and then the consul, 
> and then the praetor, and then the curule aedile, and then the quaestor. 
> 
> Any magistrate could obstruct ("veto") an action 
> that was being taken by a magistrate with an equal or lower degree of magisterial powers. 
> 
> By definition, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles were technically not magistrates 
> since they were elected only by the plebeians, and plebeian tribunes could veto the actions of any ordinary magistrate.
>
> During the transition from republic to the Roman empire, 
> the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman Senate back to the Roman Emperor. 
> 
> Theoretically, the senate elected each new emperor; in practice each emperor chose his own successor, 
> though the choice was often overruled by the army or civil war. 
> 
> The powers of an emperor (his imperium) existed, in theory at least, by virtue of his legal standing. 
> The two most significant components to an emperor's imperium were the "tribunician powers" and the "proconsular powers". 
> 
> In theory at least, 
> - the tribunician powers (which were similar to those of the plebeian tribunes under the old republic) 
>   gave the emperor authority over Rome's civil government, 
> - while the proconsular powers (similar to those of military governors, or proconsuls, under the old republic) 
>   gave him authority over the Roman army. 
> 
> While these distinctions were clearly defined during the early empire, eventually they were lost, 
> and the emperor's powers became less constitutional and more monarchical. 
> 
> The traditional magistracies that survived the fall of the republic 
> were the consulship, praetorship, plebeian tribunate, aedileship, quaestorship, and military tribunate. 
> 
> Mark Antony abolished the offices of dictator and Master of the Horse during his consulship in 44 BC, 
> while the offices of Interrex and Roman censor were abolished shortly thereafter.
