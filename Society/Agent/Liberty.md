> **Liberty** is an [[../Agent|Agent]]s state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions 
> imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views. 
> 
> The concept of liberty can vary depending on perspective and context. 
> In the Constitutional law of the United States, ordered liberty means 
> creating a balanced society where individuals have the freedom to act 
> without unnecessary interference (negative liberty) 
> and access to opportunities and resources to pursue their goals (positive liberty), 
> all within a fair legal system.
>
> Sometimes **liberty** is differentiated from **freedom** by using the word "freedom" primarily, 
> if not exclusively, to mean the **ability to do as one wills** 
> and what one has the power to do; 
> and using the word "liberty" to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, 
> but taking into account the rights of all involved. 
> 
> In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability 
> and limited by the rights of others. 
> Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law 
> without depriving anyone else of their freedom. 
> 
> Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. 
> In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.
>
> Liberty's etymology is from the Latin word liber, 
> from Proto-Italic louðeros, 
> from Proto-Indo-European h₁léwdʰeros, from h₁lewdʰ- ('people') 
> (thus cognate to archaic English lede meaning 'man, person' and German 'Leute'). 
> 
> The word "liberty" is commonly used in slogans or quotes, 
> such as in "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" 
> from the United States Declaration of Independence, 
> and France's national motto "Liberté, égalité, fraternité".
