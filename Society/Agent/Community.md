> A **Community** is a social unit (a group of people) with a **shared socially-significant characteristic**, 
> such as place, set of norms, culture, religion, values, needs, risks, customs, or identity. 
> 
> Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area 
> (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood) 
> or in virtual space through communication platforms. 
> 
> Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties 
> also define a sense of community, important to people's identity, practice, 
> and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, 
> or humanity at large. 
> 
> Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, 
> "community" may also refer to large-group affiliations 
> such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.
>
> In terms of sociological categories, a community can seem like a sub-set of a social collectivity.
>
> In developmental views, a **community can emerge out of a collectivity**.
>
> The English-language word "community" 
> derives from the Old French comuneté (Modern French: communauté), 
> which comes from the Latin communitas "community", "public spirit" 
> (from Latin communis, "common").
>
> Human communities may have **intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common**, 
> affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.
