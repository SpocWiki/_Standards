## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Person** (pl.: people or persons, depending on context) 
> is a being who has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, 
> and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations 
> such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. 
> 
> The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, 
> differ widely among cultures and contexts.
>
> In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, 
> there are further questions about personal identity and self: 
> both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, 
> and about what makes a person at one time the same person 
> as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.
>
> The plural form "people" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in "a people"), 
> and this was the original meaning of the word; 
> it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. 
> 
> The plural form "persons" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.
