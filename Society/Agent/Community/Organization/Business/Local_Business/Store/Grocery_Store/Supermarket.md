> A **Supermarket** is a self-service shop 
> offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, 
> organized into sections under one roof. 
> 
> The supermarket retail format first appeared around 1930 in the United States 
> as the culmination of almost two decades of retail innovations to the grocery store, 
> and began to spread to other countries after extensive worldwide publicity in 1956. 
> 
> In everyday American English usage, 
> "grocery store" is often used interchangeably with "supermarket", 
> while in other regions a supermarket is larger and has a wider selection, 
> but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or megastore, 
> which developed decades later.
>
> The supermarket typically has places for fresh meat, fresh produce, dairy, 
> deli items, baked goods, and similar foodstuffs. 
> 
> Shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods 
> and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, 
> pharmacy products and pet supplies. 
> 
> Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, 
> such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothing, 
> and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: 
> DVDs, art supplies, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items e.g., 
> Christmas wrapping paper, Easter eggs, school uniforms, Valentine's Day themed gifts, Mother's Day gifts, Father's Day gifts and Halloween.
>
> A larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket. Other services may include those of banks, cafés, childcare centers/creches, insurance (and other financial services), mobile phone sales, photo processing, video rentals, pharmacies, and Filling stations. In the US, if the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a "grocerant", a portmanteau  of "grocery" and "restaurant".
>
> The traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day. Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers and television. They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products.
>
> Supermarkets typically are chain stores, supplied by the distribution centers of their parent companies, thus increasing opportunities for economies of scale. Supermarkets usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can. They also minimize financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors. Certain products (typically staple foods such as bread, milk and sugar) are very occasionally sold as loss leaders so as to attract shoppers to their store. Supermarkets make up for their low margins by a high volume of sales, and with sales of higher-margin items bought by the customers. Self-service with shopping carts (trolleys) or baskets reduces labor costs, and many supermarket chains are attempting further reduction by shifting to self-service check-outs.
