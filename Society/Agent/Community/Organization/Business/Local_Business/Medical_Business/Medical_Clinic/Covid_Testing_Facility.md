A CovidTestingFacility is a [[MedicalClinic]] where testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus
	  disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established [[../Pharmacy]], [[../../Lodging_Business/Hotel]], or other
	  non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information
	  about that place, e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.
