## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **library** is a collection of books, and possibly other materials and media, 
> that is accessible for use by its members and members of allied institutions. 
> 
> Libraries provide physical (hard copies) or digital (soft copies) materials, 
> and may be a physical location, a virtual space, or both. 
> 
> A library's collection normally includes printed materials which can be borrowed, 
> and usually also includes a reference section of publications 
> which may only be utilized inside the premises. 
> 
> Resources such as commercial releases of films, television programmes, 
> other video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings may be available in many formats. 
> These include DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, cassettes, or other applicable formats such as microform. 
> They may also provide access to information, music 
> or other content held on bibliographic databases. 
> In addition, some libraries offer creation stations for makers 
> which offer access to a 3D printing station with a 3D scanner.
>
> Libraries can vary widely in size and may be organised and maintained by a public body 
> such as a government, an institution (such as a school or museum), 
> a corporation, or a private individual. 
> 
> In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians 
> who are trained experts in finding, selecting, circulating and organising information 
> while interpreting information needs 
> and navigating and analysing large amounts of information with a variety of resources. 
> The area of study is known as library and information science or studies.
>
> Library buildings often provide quiet areas for studying, 
> as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, 
> and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources, 
> such as computers and access to the Internet.
>
> The library's clientele and general services offered vary 
> depending on its type, size and sometimes location: 
> users of a public library have different needs from those 
> of a special library or academic library, for example. 
> 
> Libraries may also be community hubs, where programmes are made available 
> and people engage in lifelong learning. 
> 
> Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of the building 
> by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.
>
> The services that libraries offer are variously described as library services, 
> information services, or the combination "library and information services", 
> although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently.
