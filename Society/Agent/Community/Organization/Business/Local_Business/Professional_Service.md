#is_a_/professional_service

Original definition: "provider of professional services."

The general [[ProfessionalService]] type for local businesses was deprecated due to confusion with [[../Service]]. For reference, the types that it included were: [[Dentist]],
		[[AccountingService]], [[Legal_Service/Attorney]], [[Legal_Service/Notary]], as well as types for several kinds of [[HomeAndConstructionBusiness]]: [[Home_and_Construction_Business/Electrician]], [[GeneralContractor]],
		[[HousePainter]], [[Home_and_Construction_Business/Locksmith]], [[Home_and_Construction_Business/Plumber]], [[RoofingContractor]]. [[LegalService]] was introduced as a more inclusive supertype of [[Legal_Service/Attorney]].
