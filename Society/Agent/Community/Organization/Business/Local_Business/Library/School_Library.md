> where students, and sometimes their parents and staff have access 
> to borrow a variety of resources, often literary or digital. 
> 
> The goal of a school library or media center is 
> to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access 
> "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology".

> is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering." 
>
> School libraries are distinct from public libraries
