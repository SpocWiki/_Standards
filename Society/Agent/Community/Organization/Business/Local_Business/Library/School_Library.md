> where students, and sometimes their parents and staff have access 
> to borrow a variety of resources, often literary or digital. 
> 
> The goal of a school library or media center is 
> to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access 
> "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology". 
> 
> A school library or media center "uses all types of media . . . 
> is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering." 
>
> School libraries are distinct from public libraries 
> because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories 
> which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum...
