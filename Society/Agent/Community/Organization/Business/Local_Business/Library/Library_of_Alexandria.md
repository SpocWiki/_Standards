> The Great Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, Egypt, 
> was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. 
> 
> The library was part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion, 
> which was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts. 
> 
> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria 
> may have been proposed by Demetrius of Phalerum, 
> an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, 
> to Ptolemy I Soter, who may have established plans for the library, 
> but the library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son Ptolemy II Philadelphus. 
> 
> The library quickly acquired many papyrus scrolls, 
> owing largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. 
> It is unknown precisely how many scrolls were housed at any given time, 
> but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.
>
> Alexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, 
> in part because of the Great Library. 
> 
> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library 
> during the third and second centuries BC, including: 
> - Zenodotus of Ephesus, who worked towards standardizing the works of Homer; 
> - Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, sometimes considered the world's first library catalog; 
> - Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem the Argonautica; 
> - Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the circumference of the earth within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; 
> - Hero of Alexandria, who invented the first recorded steam engine; 
> - Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and 
> - Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. 
> 
> During the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, 
> a daughter library was established in the Serapeum, a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis.
>
> The influence of the Library declined gradually over the course of several centuries. 
> This decline began with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC 
> during the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, 
> which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, 
> resigning and exiling himself to Cyprus. 
> 
> Many other scholars, including Dionysius Thrax and Apollodorus of Athens, 
> fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. 
> 
> The Library was accidentally burned by Julius Caesar during his civil war in 48 BC, 
> but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed 
> and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter. 
> 
> The geographer Strabo mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC, 
> and the prodigious scholarly output of Didymus Chalcenterus in Alexandria from this period 
> indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.
>
> The Library dwindled during the Roman period, from a lack of funding and support. 
> Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. 
> Between 270 and 275 AD, Alexandria saw a Palmyrene invasion 
> and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, 
> if it still existed. 
> 
> The daughter library in the Serapeum may have survived 
> after the main Library's destruction. 
> The Serapeum, mainly used as a gathering place for Neoplatonist philosophers 
> following the teachings of Iamblichus, was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD 
> under a decree issued by bishop Theophilus of Alexandria.
