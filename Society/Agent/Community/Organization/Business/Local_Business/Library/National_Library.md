> A national library is a library established by a government 
> as a country's preeminent repository of information. 
> 
> Unlike public libraries, these rarely allow citizens to borrow books. 
> Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. 
> 
> A national library is that library which has the duty of 
> collecting and preserving the literature of the nation within and outside the country. 
> 
> Thus, national libraries are those libraries whose community is the nation at large. 
> Examples include the British Library in London, 
> and the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France in Paris.
>
> There are wider definitions of a national library 
> which put less emphasis on the repository character.
>
> National libraries are usually notable for their size, 
> compared to those of the other libraries in the same country. 
> 
> Some subnational states that wish to preserve their particular cultures 
> have established comparable libraries with all the attributes of national libraries, 
> such as with legal deposit.
>
> Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section 
> of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) 
> to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards 
> and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties. 
> 
> National libraries of Europe participate in The European Library. 
> This is a service of The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).
