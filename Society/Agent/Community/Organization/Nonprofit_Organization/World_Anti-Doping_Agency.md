> The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA; French: Agence mondiale antidopage, AMA) 
> is an international organization co-founded by the governments of over 140 nations 
> along with the International Olympic Committee based in Canada 
> to promote, coordinate, and monitor the fight against drugs in sports. 
> 
> The agency's key activities include scientific research, education, 
> development of anti-doping capacities, and monitoring of the World Anti-Doping Code, 
> whose provisions are enforced by the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport. The aims of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention and the United States Anti-Doping Agency are also closely aligned with those of WADA.
>
> WADA is responsible for the World Anti-Doping Code, adopted by more than 650 sports organisations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organisations, the IOC, and the International Paralympic Committee.
