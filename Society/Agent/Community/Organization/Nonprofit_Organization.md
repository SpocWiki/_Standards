## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a nonbusiness entity, nonprofit institution, 
> not-for-profit organization (NFPO), or simply a nonprofit, 
> is a non-governmental legal entity that operates for a collective, public, or social benefit, 
> rather than to generate profit for private owners. 
> 
> Nonprofit organisations are subject to a non-distribution constraint, 
> meaning that any revenue exceeding expenses 
> must be used to further the organization’s purpose. 
> 
> Depending on local laws, nonprofits may include charities, political organizations, schools, 
> hospitals, business associations, churches, foundations, social clubs, and cooperatives. 
> 
> Some nonprofit entities obtain tax-exempt status 
> and may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions; 
> however, an organization can still be a nonprofit without having tax exemption. 
>
> Key aspects of nonprofit organisations are their ability to fulfill their mission with respect to 
> accountability, integrity, trustworthiness, honesty, 
> and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. 
> 
> Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. 
> 
> Theoretically, for a nonprofit that seeks to finance its operations through donations, 
> public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. 
> Presumably, the more a nonprofit focuses on their mission, 
> the more public confidence they will gain. 
> This may result in more money for the organization.
>
> There is an important distinction in the US 
> between non-profit and not-for-profit organizations (NFPOs); 
> while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, 
> it is not required to operate for the public good. 
> 
> An example is a sports club, whose purpose is its members' enjoyment. 
> The names used and precise regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another.
