## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The UEFA European Football Championship, less formally the European Championship 
> and informally the Euro or Euros, is the primary association football tournament 
> organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). 
> 
> The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, 
> determining the continental champion of Europe. 
> 
> It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup; 
> the Euro 2016 final was watched by a global audience of around 600 million. 
> The competition has been held every four years since 1960, 
> except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, 
> but kept the name Euro 2020. 
> 
> Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, 
> it was originally called the European Nations' Cup before changing to its current name in 1968. 
> Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as "UEFA Euro [year]".
>
> Before entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations 
> (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. 
> 
> Until 2016, the championship winners 
> could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so. 
> From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.
>
> The seventeen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: 
> - Spain have won four titles, 
> - Germany have won three titles, 
> - Italy and France have won two titles, and 
> - Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. 
> - 
> - To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.
>
> The most recent championship, held in Germany in 2024, was won by Spain, 
> who lifted a record fourth European title 
> after beating England 2–1 in the final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.
