## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Standardization** (American English) or standardisation (British English) 
> is the process of implementing and developing technical standards 
> based on the consensus of different parties that include 
> firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and governments. 
> 
> Standardization can help maximize 
> compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, efficiency, and quality. 
> 
> It can also facilitate a normalization of formerly custom processes. 
>
> In social sciences, including economics, 
> the idea of standardization is close to the solution for a coordination problem, 
> a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, 
> but only by making mutually consistent decisions. 
> 
> Divergent national, industrial or company standards impose costs on consumers 
> and can be a form of non-tariff trade barrier.
