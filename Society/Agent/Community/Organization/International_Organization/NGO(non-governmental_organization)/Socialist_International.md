## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Socialist (Social Democracy) International (SI) is a political international 
> consisting mostly of social democratic political parties and labour organisations. 
> The SI was founded in support of democratic socialism, 
> albeit it has generally moderated over time.
>
> Although formed in 1951 as a successor to the Labour and Socialist International, 
> it has antecedents in the late 19th century. 
> 
> The organisation currently includes 132 member parties and organisations 
> from over 100 countries. 
> 
> Its members have governed in many countries, including most of Europe. 
> In 2013, a schism in the SI led to the establishment of the Progressive Alliance.
>
> The current secretary general of the SI is Benedicta Lasi of Ghana, the current president is the prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, and the current vice-president is Temirlan Sultanbekov of Kyrgyzstan, all of whom were elected at the last SI Congress held in Madrid, Spain, in November 2022.
