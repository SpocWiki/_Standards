> Pirate Parties International (PPI) is an international non-profit 
> and non-governmental organization with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 
> 
> Formed in 2010, it serves as a worldwide organization for Pirate Parties, 
> currently representing 39 members from 36 countries across 
> Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australasia. 
> 
> The Pirate Parties are political incarnations of the freedom of expression movement, 
> trying to achieve their goals by the means of the established political system 
> rather than just through activism. 
> 
> In 2017, PPI had been granted special consultative status 
> to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
