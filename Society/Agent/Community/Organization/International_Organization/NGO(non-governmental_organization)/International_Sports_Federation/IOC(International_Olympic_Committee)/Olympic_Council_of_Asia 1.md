> The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) is a governing body of sports in Asia, 
> currently with 45 member National Olympic Committees. 
> 
> Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was elected as President of the OCA on 8 July 2023. 
> However, on 30 July 2023, the International Olympic Committee asked Randhir Singh, who was the acting president at the time, to continue as the Acting President of the OCA while the IOC investigated the OCA presidential election of 2023. On 13 October 2023, the IOC ethics committee asked the OCA to annul its 2023 elections due to Talal’s candidacy not fulfilling the eligibility conditions defined by the OCA Constitution and election interference by his brother Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah.
>
> The headquarters of the OCA is located at Kuwait City, Kuwait.
