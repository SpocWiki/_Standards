> The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) is a governing body of sports in Asia, 
> currently with 45 member National Olympic Committees. 
> 
> Talal Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was elected as President of the OCA on 8 July 2023. 
> 
> However, on 30 July 2023, the International Olympic Committee asked Randhir Singh, 
> who was the acting president at the time, to continue as the Acting President of the OCA 
> while the IOC investigated the OCA presidential election of 2023. 
> 
> On 13 October 2023, the IOC ethics committee asked the OCA to annul its 2023 elections 
> due to Talalâ€™s candidacy not fulfilling the eligibility conditions defined by the OCA Constitution 
> and election interference by his brother Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah.
>
> The headquarters of the OCA is located at Kuwait City, Kuwait.
