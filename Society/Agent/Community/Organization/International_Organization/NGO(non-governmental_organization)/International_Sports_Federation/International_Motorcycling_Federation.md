## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The International Motorcycling Federation (Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme) 
> or (FIM) is the global governing/sanctioning body of motorcycle racing. 
> It represents 123 national motorcycle federations that are divided into six continental unions.
>
> There are seven motorcycle-racing disciplines that FIM covers, 
> encompassing 82 world championships as well as hundreds of secondary championships: 
> enduro, trial, circuit racing, motocross and supermoto, cross-country, e-bike, and track racing. FIM is also involved in many non-racing activities that promote the sport, its safety, and support relevant public policy. The FIM is also the first international sporting federation to publish an Environmental Code, in 1994. In 2007, a Commission for Women in Motorcycling was created by the FIM in order to promote the use of powered two-wheelers and the motorcycle sport among women.
