> The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Swedish: Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin) is awarded 
> annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists in the various fields of physiology or medicine. 
> 
> It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), 
> awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. 
> As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation 
> and awarded by a committee that consists of five members and an executive secretary 
> elected by the Karolinska Institute. 
> 
> While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, 
> Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for "physiology or medicine" in his will. 
> 
> Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields. 
> The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring. 
> 
> Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. 
> In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which was equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008. 
> The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.
>
> Laureates have won the Nobel Prize in a wide range of fields that relate to physiology or medicine. 
> As of 2009, 8 Prizes have been awarded for contributions in the field of signal transduction by G proteins and second messengers, 13 have been awarded for contributions in the field of neurobiology 
> and 13 have been awarded for contributions in intermediary metabolism. 
> 
> In 1939 Gerhard Domagk, a German, was not allowed by his government to accept the prize. 
> He later received a medal and diploma, but not the money. 
> As of 2024, the prize has been awarded to 229 individuals, 
> thirteen of them were women (Gerty Cori being the first to be awarded in 1947).
>
> There have been nine years in which the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was not awarded 
> (1915–1918, 1921, 1925, 1940–1942). 
> There were also five years for which the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was delayed for one year. 
> The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine decided that 
> none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, 
> but was awarded to Robert Bárány in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize. 
> 
> This precedent was followed for 
> - the 1922 prize awarded to Archibald Hill and Otto Fritz Meyerhof in 1923, 
> - the 1926 prize awarded to Johannes Fibiger in 1927, 
> - the 1938 prize awarded to Corneille Heymans in 1939, and 
> - the 1943 prize awarded to Henrik Dam and Edward Adelbert Doisy in 1944.
