> A sports governing body is a sports organization that has a regulatory or sanctioning function.
>
> Sports governing bodies come in various forms and have a variety of regulatory functions, 
> including disciplinary procedure for rule infractions 
> and deciding on rule changes in the sport that they govern. 
> 
> Governing bodies have different scopes. 
> They may cover a range of sport at an internationally acceptable level, 
> such as the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, 
> or only a single sport at a national level, such as the Rugby Football League. 
> 
> National bodies will largely have to be affiliated with international bodies for the same sport. 
> The first international federations were formed at the end of the 19th century.
