## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Commonwealth of Nations**, often simply referred to as the Commonwealth, 
> is an international association of 56 member states, 
> the vast majority of which are former territories of the British Empire from which it developed. 
> 
> They are connected through their use of the English language and historical-cultural ties. 
> The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat, 
> which focuses on intergovernmental relations, and the Commonwealth Foundation, 
> which focuses on non-governmental relations between member nations. 
> Numerous organisations are associated with and operate within the Commonwealth. 
> It is known colloquially as the British Commonwealth.
>
> The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was created as the British Commonwealth of Nations through the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference, and formalised by the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931. The current Commonwealth of Nations was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949, which modernised the community and established the member states as "free and equal". 
>
> The Head of the Commonwealth is Charles III. He is king of 15 member states, known as the Commonwealth realms, whilst 36 other members are republics, and five others have different monarchs. Although he became head upon the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, the position is not technically hereditary.
>
> Member states have no legal obligations to one another, though some have institutional links to other Commonwealth nations. Commonwealth citizenship affords benefits in some member countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, and Commonwealth countries are represented to one another by high commissions rather than embassies. The Commonwealth Charter defines their shared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games.
>
> A majority of Commonwealth countries are small states, with small island developing states constituting almost half its membership.
