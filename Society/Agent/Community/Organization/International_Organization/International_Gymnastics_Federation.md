## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The International Gymnastics Federation 
> (French: Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique, abbr. FIG) 
> is the body governing competition in all disciplines of gymnastics. 
> Its headquarters is in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
> 
> It was founded on 23 July 1881 in Liège, Belgium, 
> making it the world's oldest existing international sports organisation. 
> Originally called the European Federation of Gymnastics, it had three member countries—
> Belgium, France and the Netherlands—
> until 1921, when non-European countries were admitted and it received its current name.
>
> The federation sets the rules, known as the Code of Points, 
> that regulate how gymnasts' performances are evaluated. 
> Seven gymnastics disciplines are governed by the FIG: artistic gymnastics, further classified as men's artistic gymnastics and women's artistic gymnastics; rhythmic gymnastics; aerobic gymnastics; acrobatic gymnastics; trampolining; double mini trampoline, tumbling and parkour. Additionally, the federation is responsible for determining gymnasts' age eligibility to participate in the Olympics.
>
> After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIG barred Russian athletes and officials, including judges. It also announced that "all FIG World Cup and World Challenge Cup events planned to take place in Russia ... are cancelled, and no other FIG events will be allocated to Russia ... until further notice." FIG also banned the Russian flag at its events. In 19 July 2023, FIG decided to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes and support personnels to participant events under individual neutral athletes.
