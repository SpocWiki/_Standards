> The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) 
> was an international organization for collective defense in Southeast Asia 
> created by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty 
> signed in September 1954 in Manila, Philippines. 
> 
> The formal institution of SEATO was established on 19 February 1955 
> at a meeting of treaty partners in Bangkok, Thailand. 
> 
> The organization's headquarters was also in Bangkok. 
> A total of eight members joined the organization in its lifetime.
>
> Primarily created to block further communist gains in Southeast Asia, 
> SEATO is generally considered a failure, 
> as internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; 
> however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs 
> left longstanding effects in Southeast Asia. 
> 
> SEATO was dissolved on 30 June 1977, after many of its members lost interest and withdrew.
