## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A non-governmental organization (**NGO**) is an independent, typically nonprofit organization 
> that operates outside government control. 
> 
> NGOs often focus on humanitarian or social issues 
> but can also include clubs and associations offering services to members. 
> Some NGOs, like the World Economic Forum, may also act as lobby groups for corporations. 
> Unlike international organizations (IOs), which directly interact with sovereign states and governments, 
> NGOs are independent from them.
>
> The term as it is used today was first introduced in Article 71 
> of the newly formed United Nations Charter in 1945. 
> 
> While there is no fixed or formal definition for what NGOs are, 
> they are generally defined as nonprofit entities that are independent of governmental influence—
> although they may receive government funding.
>
> According to the UN Department of Global Communications, 
> an NGO is "a not-for profit, voluntary citizen's group 
> that is organized on a local, national or international level 
> to address issues in support of the public good". 
> 
> The term NGO is used inconsistently, 
> and is sometimes used synonymously with civil society organization (CSO), 
> which is any association founded by citizens. 
> In some countries, NGOs are known as nonprofit organizations 
> while political parties and trade unions are sometimes considered NGOs as well.
>
> NGOs are classified by 
> (1) orientation- entailing the type of activities an NGO undertakes, 
> such as activities involving human rights, consumer protection, 
> environmentalism, health, or development; and 
> (2) level of operation, which indicates the scale at which an organization works: 
> local, regional, national, or international.
>
> Russia had about 277,000 NGOs in 2008. 
> India is estimated to have had about 2 million NGOs in 2009 (approximately one per 600 Indians), 
> many more than the number of the country's primary schools and health centers. 
> The United States, by comparison, has approximately 1.5 million NGOs.
