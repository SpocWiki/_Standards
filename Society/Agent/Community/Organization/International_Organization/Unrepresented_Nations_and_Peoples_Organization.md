## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) 
> is an international organization established to facilitate 
> the voices of unrepresented and marginalized nations and peoples worldwide. 
> 
> It was formed on 11 February 1991 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. 
> Its members consist of indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognized or occupied territories.
>
> UNPO works to develop the understanding of and respect for the right to self-determination, provides advice and support related to questions of international recognition and political autonomy, trains groups on how to advocate for their causes effectively, and directly advocates for an international response to human rights violations perpetrated against UNPO member groups. Since its foundation in 1991, UNPO’s membership has grown steadily from its original founders, now representing more than 45 peoples worldwide, comprising over 300 million people lacking true representation in domestic or international forums. Over the years, many members have achieved their movement’s goals and gained formal recognition at the national or international level, leading them to leave the organization as their peoples are no longer considered “unrepresented.” Former members who have left the organization after gaining full independence and joining the United Nations (UN) include Armenia, East Timor, Estonia, Latvia, Georgia, and Palau.
>
> Throughout 2024, UNPO conducted several training sessions aimed at helping its members and activists. Sessions included in-person training for Asia Pacific members in Geneva, online cybersecurity training, a cybersecurity training in person for the Baloch community in Stockholm, an in-person training in Brussels on the principles and practical applications of non-violent resistance and a youth study session supported by the Council of Europe, emphasizing the importance of acquiring and improving necessary skills for advocacy within marginalized communities.
