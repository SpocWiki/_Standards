> The Latin Union is an international organization of nations that use Romance languages, 
> whose activities have been suspended since 2012. 
> 
> Headquartered in Paris, France, it aims to protect, project, 
> and promote the common cultural heritage of Latin peoples 
> and unifying identities of the Romance, and Romance-influenced, world. 
> 
> It was created in 1954 in Madrid, Spain. 
> It started to operate in 1983 and its membership rose from 12 to 36 states, 
> including countries in North America, South America, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.
>
> Due to financial difficulties, 
> the Latin Union announced on 26 January 2012 the suspension of its activities, 
> the dissolution of its Secretariat General (effective 31 July 2012), 
> and the termination of employment for all the organization's personnel.
