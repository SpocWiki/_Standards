## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC; French: Chambre de commerce internationale) 
> is the largest, most representative business organization in the world. 
> ICC represents over 45 million businesses in over 170 countries 
> who have interests spanning every sector of private enterprise.
>
> ICC's current chair is Philippe Varin 
> and John W.H. Denton AO is the current Secretary General .
>
> ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolution, and policy advocacy. 
> Because its member companies and associations 
> are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority 
> in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. 
> Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in thousands of transactions every day 
> and have become part of international trade.
>
> A world network of national committees in over 90 countries advocates business priorities at national and regional level. More than 5,000 experts drawn from ICC's member companies feed their knowledge and experience into crafting the ICC stance on specific business issues through specialised ICC Policy Commissions.
>
> ICC is the only business organisation to have Observer Status at the United Nations General Assembly, and is a representative voice for business at the World Trade Organization, and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional, such as G20 on behalf of international business. ICC was the first organization granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and UN Observer Status.
