> The Group of Seven (**G7**) is an intergovernmental political and economic forum 
> consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; 
> additionally, the European Union (EU) is a "non-enumerated member". 
> It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, 
> and representative government. G7 members are major IMF advanced economies.
>
> Originating from an ad hoc gathering of finance ministers in 1973, 
> the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue 
> for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, 
> especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change. 
> 
> Each member's head of government or state, 
> along with the EU's Commission president and European Council president, 
> meet annually at the G7 Summit; 
> other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. 
> Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, 
> with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.
>
> The G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. 
> It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, 
> with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; 
> Canada presides for 2025. 
> 
> While lacking a legal or institutional basis, 
> the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence; 
> it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, 
> including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, 
> and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement. 
> 
> However, the group has been criticized by observers 
> for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, 
> narrow global representation, and ineffectualness. 
> 
> The rise of BRICS+ for example, with its expanded membership 
> and focus on South-South cooperation, reflects a broader shift in global power dynamics, 
> with emerging economies gaining greater influence in international affairs.
>
> The G7 countries have together a population of about 780 million people 
> (or almost 10% of the world population), comprise around 50% of worldwide nominal net wealth 
> and as of 2024 more than 44% of world nominal GDP 
> and about 30% of world GDP by purchasing power parity.
