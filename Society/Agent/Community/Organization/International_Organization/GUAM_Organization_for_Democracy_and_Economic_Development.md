> The GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development 
> is a regional organization of four post-Soviet states: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.
>
> Conceived in 1997 to harmonize and integrate commercial, diplomatic 
> and democratic relations among its member states, the GUAM treaty charter was signed in 2001 
> and today covers a population of over 49.8 million people. 
> 
> Uzbekistan was also a member of GUAM in the 1999â€“2005 period. 
> In 2003, GUAM became an observer in the UN General Assembly. 
> In 2007, GUAM also established a military peacekeeping force and organized joint military exercises. 
> Such increasingly deepened integration and relationships 
> led to GUAM playing an important role in the region's diplomatic and commercial affairs.
>
> The agreement on a Free Trade Area was signed in 2002. 
> In 2017, additional agreements on a free-trade area were announced, 
> but as of 2022 reportedly the FTA has not been ratified and has not entered into force. 
> 
> The WTO was notified only in 2017 and the Agreement is designated as "Plurilateral" and "In Force". 
> According to the WTO database, the GUAM FTA agreement was signed in 2002 
> and entered into force in 2003. 
> International Trade Centre says there is no free trade area in operation 
> with distinct rules from an Agreement on Creation of CIS Free Trade Area, 
> was signed on 15 April 1994 by 12 CIS countries.
>
> The database of agreements of the International Trade Centre 
> does not indicate that a GUAM FTA agreement has been concluded, 
> but it does indicate that the 1994 Agreement on CIS FTA 
> is in force for Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova 
> and the 1999 Agreement on CIS FTA version is listed as the current text of the FTA agreement.
>
> The official negotiating language of GUAM was Russian, but it was scrapped in favor of English in 2014.
>
> Election monitoring by GUAM has been described as "low-quality", 
> as observers from the group validate flawed elections.
