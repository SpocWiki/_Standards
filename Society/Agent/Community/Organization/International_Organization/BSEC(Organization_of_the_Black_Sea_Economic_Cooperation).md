> The Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) 
> is a regional international organization focusing on multilateral political and economic initiatives 
> aimed at fostering cooperation, peace, stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region. 
> 
> It traces its origin to 25 June 1992, when Turkish President Turgut Özal 
> and leaders of ten other countries gathered in Istanbul 
> and signed the Summit Declaration and the "Bosphorus Statement". 
> BSEC Headquarters – the Permanent International Secretariat of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC PERMIS) – was established in March 1994, also in Istanbul.
>
> With the entry into force of its Charter on 1 May 1999, BSEC acquired international legal identity 
> and was transformed into a full-fledged regional economic organization: 
> Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. 
> 
> With the accession of Serbia (then Serbia and Montenegro) in April 2004, 
> the Organization’s Member States increased to twelve. 
> North Macedonia's accession in 2020 increased the organization's membership to thirteen.
>
> An important aspect of the activities of BSEC is 
> the development of SME and entrepreneurship in the member countries. 
> Concerning these issues, a series of workshops have been organized 
> in cooperation with Konrad Adenauer Foundation and ERENET.
