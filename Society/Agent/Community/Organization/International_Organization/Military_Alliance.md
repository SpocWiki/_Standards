> A military alliance is a formal agreement between nations 
> that specifies mutual obligations regarding national security. 
> 
> In the event a nation is attacked, 
> members of the alliance are often obligated to come to their defense regardless if attacked directly. 
> 
> Military alliances can be classified into defense pacts, non-aggression pacts, and ententes. 
> Alliances may be covert (as was common from 1870 to 1916) or public. 
>
> According to a 2002 dataset of military alliances, 
> there have been 538 alliance treaties from 1815 to 2003. 
> 
> The vast majority of the alliances involve 
> commitments to come to the military support of one ally involved in war. 
> 
> The vast majority are defensive in nature. 
> 
> Since the end of the Second World War, 
> military alliances have usually behaved less aggressively 
> and act more as a deterrent. 
> 
> A 2025 analysis of alliances across the 19th and 20th century found that alliances overall tend to deter war.
