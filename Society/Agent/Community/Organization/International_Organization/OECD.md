> is an intergovernmental organization with 38 member countries, 
> founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.

> providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, 
> identify good practices, and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members.
>

> with high-income economies, and a very high Human Development Index.

> with an average life expectancy of 80 years and a median age of 40, against a global average of 30.

> 
> The OECD is an official [[United_Nations_Observer]].

> their average social welfare spending stood at roughly 21% of GDP.
>

> which housed its predecessor organization, 
> the Organization for European Economic Co-operation. 
>
