> The International Council on Monuments and Sites 
> (ICOMOS; French: Conseil international des monuments et des sites) 
> is a professional association that works for the conservation 
> and protection of cultural heritage places around the world. 
> 
> Now headquartered in Charenton-le-Pont, France, ICOMOS was founded in 1965 in Warsaw 
> as a result of the Venice Charter of 1964 
> and offers advice to UNESCO on World Heritage Sites.
>
> The idea behind ICOMOS dates to 
> the Athens Conference on the restoration of historic buildings in 1931, 
> organized by the International Museums Office. 
> 
> The Athens Charter of 1931 introduced the concept of international heritage. 
> In 1964, the Second Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 
> meeting in Venice, adopted 13 resolutions. 
> The first created the International Charter on the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, better known as Venice Charter; 
> the second, put forward by UNESCO, created ICOMOS to carry out this charter.
>
> ICOMOS currently has over 10,100 individual members in 153 countries, 
> 110 national committees, and 28 international scientific committees. 
> With rare exceptions, each member must be qualified in the field of conservation 
> and a practicing landscape architect, architect, archaeologist, anthropologist, town planner, engineer, administrator of heritage, historian, art historian, palaeontologist or archivist.
>
> ICOMOS is a partner and founding member of the Blue Shield, 
> which works to protect the world's cultural heritage threatened by war and natural disasters.
