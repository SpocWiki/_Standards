## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **G20** or Group of 20 is an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 sovereign countries, 
> the European Union (EU), and the African Union (AU). 
> It works to address major issues related to the global economy, 
> such as international financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable development, 
> through annual meetings of Heads of State and Heads of Government.
>
> The sovereign states of the G20 (without its international members, like the EU or AU) 
> account for around 85% of gross world product (GWP), 75% of international trade, 
> 56% of the global population, and 60% of the world's land area. 
> Including the EU and AU, the G20 comprises 78.9% of global population 
> and 83.9% of global CO2 emissions from fossil energy.
>
> The G20 was founded in 1999 in response to several world economic crises. 
> Since 2008, it has convened at least once a year, 
> with summits involving each member's head of government or state, 
> finance minister, or foreign minister, and other high-ranking officials; 
> the EU is represented by the European Commission and the European Central Bank. 
> 
> Other countries, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations 
> are invited to attend the summits, some permanently. 
> The African Union joined as the 21st member at the 2023 summit in India 
> and was officially represented at the 2024 summit in Brazil.
>
> In its 2009 summit, the G20 declared itself the primary venue 
> for international economic and financial cooperation. 
> 
> The group's stature has risen during the subsequent decade, 
> and it is recognised by analysts as exercising considerable global influence; 
> it is also criticised for its limited membership, lack of enforcement powers, 
> and for the alleged undermining of existing international institutions. 
> 
> Summits are often met with protests, particularly by anti-globalization groups.
