> A guild ( GILD) is an association of artisans and merchants 
> who oversee the practice of their craft/trade in a particular territory. 
> The earliest types of guild formed as organizations of tradespeople 
> belonging to a professional association. 
> 
> They sometimes depended on grants of letters patent from a monarch or other ruler 
> to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, 
> and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials, 
> but most were regulated by the local government. 
> 
> Guild members found guilty of cheating the public would be fined or banned from the guild. 
> A lasting legacy of traditional **guilds** are the guildhalls constructed and used as guild meeting-places.
>
> Typically the key "privilege" was that only guild members were allowed to sell their goods 
> or practice their skill within the city. 
> There might be controls on minimum or maximum prices, hours of trading, 
> numbers of apprentices, and many other things. 
> 
> Critics argued that these rules reduced free competition, 
> but defenders maintained that they protected professional standards.
>
> An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities at Bologna 
> (established in 1088), Oxford (at least since 1096) and Paris (c. 1150); 
> they originated as guilds of students (as at Bologna) or of masters (as at Paris).
