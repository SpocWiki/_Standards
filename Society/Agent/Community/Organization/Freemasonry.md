## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Freemasonry** (sometimes spelled Free-Masonry) consists of fraternal groups 
> that trace their origins to the medieval guilds of stonemasons. 
> Freemasonry is considered the oldest existing secular fraternal organisation, 
> with documents and traditions dating back to the 14th century. 
> Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of three main traditions: 
> - Anglo-American style Freemasonry, which insists that a "volume of sacred law", such as the Bible, Quran or other religious text should be open in a working lodge, that every member should profess belief in a supreme being, that only men should be admitted, and discussion of religion or politics does not take place within the lodge.
> - Continental Freemasonry or Liberal style Freemasonry which has continued to evolve beyond these restrictions, particularly regarding religious belief and political discussion.
> - Women Freemasonry or Co-Freemasonry, which includes organisations that either admit women exclusively (such as the Order of Women Freemasons and the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Masons in the UK) or accept both men and women (such as Le Droit Humain). Women Freemasonry can lean both Liberal or Conservative, sometime requiring a religion or not depending on the Grand Orient or Obedience.
>
> All three traditions have evolved over time from their original forms 
> and can all refer to themselves as Regular and to other Grand Lodges as Irregular. 
> 
> The basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the Lodge. 
> These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level by a Grand Lodge or a Grand Orient. 
> There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; 
> each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.
>
> The degrees of Freemasonry are the three grades of medieval craft guilds: 
> Entered Apprentice, Journeyman or Fellow of the craft, and Master Mason. 
> The candidate of these three degrees is 
> progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry 
> and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. 
> The degrees are part allegorical morality play and part lecture. 
> These three degrees form Craft Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees 
> are known as Free-Masons, Freemasons or Masons. 
> 
> Once the Craft degrees have been conferred upon a Mason, 
> he is qualified to join various "Concordant bodies" which offer additional degrees. 
> These organisations are usually administered separately from the Grand Lodges 
> who administer the Craft degrees. 
> 
> The extra degrees vary with locality and jurisdiction. 
> In addition to these bodies, there are further organisations 
> outside of the more traditional rites of Freemasonry 
> that require an individual to be a Master Mason before they can join.
>
> Throughout its history Freemasonry has received criticism 
> and opposition on religious and political grounds. 
> The Catholic Church, some Protestant denominations and certain Islamic countries or entities 
> have expressed opposition to or banned membership in Freemasonry. 
> Opposition to Freemasonry is sometimes rooted in antisemitism or conspiracy theories, 
> and Freemasons have been persecuted by authoritarian states.
