## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as edutech, or edtech) 
> is the combined use of computer hardware, software, 
> and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning and teaching. 
> 
> When referred to with its abbreviation, "EdTech", it often refers to the industry of companies that create educational technology. 
> 
> In EdTech Inc.: Selling, Automating and Globalizing Higher Education in the Digital Age, Tanner Mirrlees and Shahid Alvi (2019) argue "EdTech is no exception to industry ownership and market rules" and "define the EdTech industries as all the privately owned companies currently involved in the financing, production and distribution of commercial hardware, software, cultural goods, services and platforms for the educational market with the goal of turning a profit. Many of these companies are US-based and rapidly expanding into educational markets across North America, and increasingly growing all over the world."
>
> In addition to the practical educational experience, educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication, education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science. It encompasses several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online learning, and m-learning where mobile technologies are used.
