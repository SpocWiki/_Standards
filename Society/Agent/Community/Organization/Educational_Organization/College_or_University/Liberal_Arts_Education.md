> Liberal arts education (from Latin  liberalis 'free' and  ars 'art or principled practice') 
> is a traditional academic course in Western higher education. 
> 
> Liberal arts takes the term art in the sense of a learned skill 
> rather than specifically the fine arts. 
> Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course 
> or to a university education more generally. 
> Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, 
> or technical, as well as religiously based courses.
>
> The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum 
> dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, 
> mostly expanding it. 
> The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into 
> - the trivium of rhetoric, grammar, and logic, and 
> - the quadrivium of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music.  
> 
> Liberal arts colleges and schools often have names such as arts and social sciences, 
> arts and sciences and humanities. 
> Liberal arts degrees from today's universities and colleges 
> traditionally include the following disciplines: 
> - [[../../../../../Anthropology|Anthropology]], 
> - [[../../../../../../Language/Language_Family/LangFamily-Indo-European/LangFamily-Germanic/Lang-eng|English]], 
> - [[../../../../../Communication/Media/Writing/Book/Literature|Literature]], 
> - Foreign [[../../../../../../Language|Language]]s, 
> - [[../../../../../../Philosophy|Philosophy]], 
> - [[../../../../../../bio/Psychology|Psychology]], 
> - [[../../../../../Anthropology/Sociology|Sociology]], 
> - [[../../../../../Communication/Media/Music|Music]], 
> - [[../../../../../Communication/Media/Journalism|Journalism]],

> Degrees in Liberal studies are often confused with those in a liberal arts discipline. 
> Liberal studies refers to degrees with a broad curriculum, 
> across multiple liberal arts disciplines and/or sciences and technologies. 
>
> Enrollment in liberal arts degree programs 
> has been declining in the 2010s and 2020s in the United States, 
> in part because of a perception of worse job prospects. 
> 
> As of 2023, liberal arts degrees holders in the United States had a median wage of 60,000 USD, as opposed to 70,000 USD for all degree holders.
