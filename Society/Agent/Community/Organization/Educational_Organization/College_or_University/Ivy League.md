> The **Ivy League** is an American collegiate athletic conference of 
> eight private research universities in the Northeastern United States. 
> 
> It participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, 
> and in football, in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 
> 
> The term Ivy League is used more broadly to refer to the eight schools that belong to the league, 
> which are globally renowned as elite colleges associated with academic excellence, 
> highly selective admissions, and social elitism. 
> 
> The term was used as early as 1933, and it became official in 1954 
> following the formation of the Ivy League athletic conference. 
> At times, they have also been referred to as the "Ancient Eight".
>
> The eight members of the Ivy League are

> and the College of William & Mary, became public institutions.
