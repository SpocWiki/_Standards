## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A thesis (pl.: theses), or dissertation (abbreviated diss.), 
> is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree 
> or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings. 
> 
> In some contexts, the word thesis or a cognate 
> is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, 
> while dissertation is normally applied to a doctorate. 
> 
> This is the typical arrangement in American English. 
> In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom, 
> the Indian subcontinent/South Asia, South Africa, the Commonwealth Countries, 
> and Brazil, the reverse is true. 
> The term graduate thesis is sometimes used 
> to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.
>
> The required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation 
> can vary by country, university, or program, 
> and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.
>
> The word dissertation can at times be used 
> to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. 
> The term thesis is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.
