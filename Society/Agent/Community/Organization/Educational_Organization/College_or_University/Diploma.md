> A **Diploma** is a document awarded by an educational institution 
> (such as a college or university) testifying the recipient has graduated 
> by successfully completing their courses of studies. 
> Historically, it has also referred to a charter or official document of diplomacy.
>
> The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a testamur, 
> Latin for "we testify" or "certify" (testari), so called from the word with which the certificate begins; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a degree. Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a parchment. The certificate that a Nobel laureate receives is also called a diploma.
>
> The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a monarch affirming a grant or tenure of specified land and its conditions (see Anglo-Saxon charters and diplomatics).
