> A **College** (Latin: collegium) may be a tertiary educational institution 
> (sometimes awarding degrees), part of a collegiate university, 
> an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, 
> or a secondary school.
>
> In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, 
> a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, 
> a higher-education provider that does not have university status 
> (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. 
> 
> In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – 
> either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees. The word "college" is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US, and as used in phrases such as "college students" and "going to college" it is understood to mean any degree granting institution, whether denominated a school, an institute, a college, or a university.  
>
> Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.
