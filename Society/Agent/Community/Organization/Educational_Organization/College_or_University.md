> A **University** (from Latin  universitas 'a whole') is an institution of tertiary education and research 
> which awards academic degrees in several academic disciplines. 
> 
> University is derived from the Latin phrase universitas magistrorum et scholarium, 
> which roughly means "community of teachers and scholars". 
> Universities typically offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs.
>
> The first universities in Europe developed from schools 
> that had been maintained by the Church for the purpose of educating priests. 
> The University of Bologna (Università di Bologna), Italy, which was founded in 1088, 
> is the first university in the sense of:
> - being a high degree-awarding institute. 
> - using the word universitas (which was coined at its foundation). 
> - having independence from the ecclesiastic schools and 
> - issuing secular as well as non-secular degrees 
> - (with teaching conducted by both clergy and non-clergy): 
> 	- grammar, rhetoric, logic, theology, canon law and notarial law.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **College** (Latin: collegium) may be a tertiary educational institution (sometimes awarding degrees), part of a collegiate university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.
>
> In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, 
> a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, 
> a higher-education provider that does not have university status 
> (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. 
> 
> In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees. The word "college" is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US, and as used in phrases such as "college students" and "going to college" it is understood to mean any degree granting institution, whether denominated a school, an institute, a college, or a university.  
>
> Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.
