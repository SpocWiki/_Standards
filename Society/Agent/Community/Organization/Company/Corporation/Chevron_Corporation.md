> Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy corporation 
> predominantly specializing in oil and gas. 
> The second-largest direct descendant of Standard Oil, 
> and originally known as the Standard Oil Company of California 
> (shortened to Socal or CalSo), it is active in more than 180 countries. 
> Within oil and gas, Chevron is vertically integrated 
> and is involved in hydrocarbon exploration, production, refining, marketing 
> and transport, chemicals manufacturing and sales, and power generation.
>
> Founded originally in Southern California during the 1870s, 
> the company was then based for many decades in San Francisco, California, 
> before moving its corporate offices to San Ramon, California, in 2001; on August 2, 2024, 
> Chevron announced that it would be transferring its headquarters to Houston, Texas.
>
> Chevron traces its history back to the second half of the 19th century 
> to small California-based oil companies which were acquired by Standard 
> and merged into Standard Oil of California. 
> The company grew quickly on its own after the breakup of Standard Oil 
> by continuing to acquire companies and partnering with others 
> both inside and outside of California, 
> eventually becoming one of the Seven Sisters 
> that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.
>
> In 1985, Socal merged with the Pittsburgh-based Gulf Oil and rebranded as Chevron; 
> the newly merged company later merged with Texaco in 2001. 
> Chevron manufactures and sells fuels, lubricants, additives, 
> and petrochemicals, primarily in Western North America, 
> the US Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea and Australia. 
> In 2018, the company produced an average of 791,000 barrels (125,800 m3) 
> of net oil-equivalent per day in United States.
>
> Chevron is one of the largest companies in the world 
> and the second-largest oil company based in the United States by revenue, 
> only behind fellow Standard Oil descendant ExxonMobil. 
> 
> Chevron ranked 10th on the Fortune 500 in 2023. 
> The company is also the last-remaining oil-and-gas component 
> of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since ExxonMobil's exit from the index in 2020.
>
> Chevron has been subject to numerous controversies.
