> The United East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie [vərˈeːnɪɣdə oːstˈɪndisə kɔmpɑˈɲi]; abbr. VOC [veː(j)oːˈseː]), commonly known as the Dutch East India Company, 
> was a chartered trading company and one of the first joint-stock companies in the world. 
> 
> Established on 20 March 1602 by the States General of the Netherlands 
> amalgamating existing companies, it was granted a 21-year monopoly 
> to carry out trade activities in Asia. 
> 
> Shares in the company could be purchased by any citizen of the Dutch Republic 
> and subsequently bought and sold in open-air secondary markets 
> (one of which became the Amsterdam Stock Exchange). 
> 
> The company possessed quasi-governmental powers, 
> including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, 
> negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies. 
> 
> Also, because it traded across multiple colonies and countries from both the East and the West, 
> the VOC is sometimes considered to have been the world's first multinational corporation.
>
> Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asian trade. 
> Between 1602 and 1796, the VOC sent nearly a million Europeans 
> to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships 
> and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods and slaves. 
> 
> By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, 
> and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, 
> was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships 
> and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. 
> The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly 
> and slave trading activities through most of the 17th century.
>
> Having been established in 1602 to profit from the Malukan spice trade, 
> the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jayakarta in 1619 
> and changed its name to Batavia (now Jakarta). 
> 
> Over the next two centuries the company acquired additional ports as trading bases 
> and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. 
> It remained an important trading concern and paid annual dividends 
> that averaged to about 18% of the capital for almost 200 years.
>
> Weighed down by smuggling, corruption and growing administrative costs in the late 18th century, 
> the company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1799. 
> Its possessions and debt were taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic.
