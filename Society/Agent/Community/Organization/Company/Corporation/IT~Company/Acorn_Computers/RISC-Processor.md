# [[RISC-Processor]]  

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In electronics and computer science, a reduced instruction set computer (**RISC**) 
> is a computer architecture designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the computer. 
> Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), 
> a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task 
> because the individual instructions are written in simpler code. 
> 
> The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, 
> in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline, 
> which may be simpler to achieve given simpler instructions.
>
> The key operational concept of the RISC computer is that 
> each instruction performs only one function (e.g. copy a value from memory to a register). 
> 
> The RISC computer usually has many (16 or 32) high-speed, general-purpose registers 
> with a load–store architecture in which the code for the register-register instructions (for performing arithmetic and tests) are separate from the instructions that access the main memory of the computer. 
> The design of the CPU allows RISC computers few simple addressing modes 
> and predictable instruction times that simplify design of the system as a whole.
>
> The conceptual developments of the RISC computer architecture 
> began with the IBM 801 project in the late 1970s, but these were not immediately put into use. 
> Designers in California picked up the 801 concepts in two seminal projects, Stanford MIPS and Berkeley RISC. 
> These were commercialized in the 1980s as the MIPS and SPARC systems. 
> IBM eventually produced RISC designs based on further work on the 801 concept, 
> the IBM POWER architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. 
> As the projects matured, many similar designs, produced in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, 
> such as ARM, PA-RISC, and Alpha, created central processing units that 
> increased the commercial utility of the Unix workstation 
> and of embedded processors in the laser printer, the router, and similar products.
>
> In the minicomputer market, companies that included Celerity Computing, Pyramid Technology, 
> and Ridge Computers began offering systems designed according to RISC principles in the early 1980s. 
> Few of these designs began by using RISC microprocessors.
>
> The varieties of RISC processor design include the ARC processor, DEC Alpha, AMD Am29000, 
> the ARM architecture, the Atmel AVR, Blackfin, Intel i860, Intel i960, LoongArch, 
> Motorola 88000, the MIPS architecture, PA-RISC, Power ISA, RISC-V, SuperH, and SPARC. 
> RISC processors are used in supercomputers, such as the Fugaku.
