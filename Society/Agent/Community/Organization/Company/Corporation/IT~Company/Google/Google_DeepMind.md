## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> DeepMind Technologies Limited, trading as Google DeepMind or simply DeepMind, 
> is a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory 
> which serves as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. 
> 
> Founded in the UK in 2010, it was acquired by Google in 2014 for 400M$ 
> under the Aegis of [[Schmidt,Eric]] for access to massive Compute, 
> and later merged with Google AI's Google Brain division 
> to become Google DeepMind in April 2023. 
> 
> The company is headquartered in London, 
> with research centres in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and Switzerland.
>
> In 2014, DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine). 
> 
> The company has created many neural network models 
> trained with reinforcement learning to play video games and board games. 
> 
> It made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat Lee Sedol, 
> a Go world champion, in a five-game match, 
> which was later featured in the documentary AlphaGo. 
> 
> A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs 
> playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself 
> using reinforcement learning. 
> 
> DeepMind has since trained models for game-playing (MuZero, AlphaStar), 
> for geometry (AlphaGeometry), 
> and for algorithm discovery (AlphaEvolve, AlphaDev, AlphaTensor).
>
> In 2020, DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding 
> with AlphaFold, which achieved state of the art records on benchmark tests 
> for protein folding prediction. 
> 
> In July 2022, it was announced that over 200 million predicted protein structures, 
> representing virtually all known proteins, would be released on the AlphaFold database.
>
> Google DeepMind has become 
> responsible for the development of Gemini (Google's family of large language models) 
> and other generative AI tools, such as the text-to-image model Imagen, 
> the text-to-video model Veo, and the text-to-music model Lyria.
