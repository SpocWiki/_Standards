A common strategy against the take rate is to persuade the client 
- to cancel the Reservation (costs a fee) and 
- to pay in cash. 

One problem for these drivers is to obtain good reviews, 
but since they don't incur negative Reviews, it is sufficient to serve a few actual bookings
and provide excellent service on these.
