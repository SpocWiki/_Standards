> The **ImageNet** project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. 
> More than 14 million images have been hand-annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured 
> and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. 
> 
> ImageNet contains more than 20,000 categories, with a typical category, 
> such as "balloon" or "strawberry", consisting of several hundred images. 
> 
> The database of annotations of third-party image URLs is freely available directly from ImageNet, 
> though the actual images are not owned by ImageNet. 
> 
> Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, 
> the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), 
> where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes. 
> The challenge uses a "trimmed" list of one thousand non-overlapping classes.
