## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> William Henry Gates III  (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman and philanthropist. 
> A pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, 
> he co-founded the software company Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. 
> 
> Following the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), Gates became a billionaire in 1987—
> then the youngest ever, at age 31. 
> Forbes magazine ranked him as the world's wealthiest person for 18 out of 24 years 
> between 1995 and 2017, including 13 years consecutively from 1995 to 2007. 
> He became the first centibillionaire in 1999, when his net worth briefly surpassed $100 billion. 
> According to Forbes, as of May 2025, his net worth stood at US$115.1 billion, 
> making him the thirteenth-richest individual in the world.
>
> Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates was privately educated at Lakeside School, 
> where he befriended Allen and developed his computing interests. 
> In 1973, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he took classes 
> including Math 55 and graduate level computer science courses, 
> but he dropped out in 1975 to co-found and lead Microsoft. 
> 
> He served as its CEO for the next 25 years 
> and also became president and chairman of the board when the company incorporated in 1981. 
> 
> Succeeded as CEO by Steve Ballmer in 2000, he transitioned to chief software architect, 
> a position he held until 2008. 
> He stepped down as chairman of the board in 2014 
> and became technology adviser to CEO Satya Nadella and other Microsoft leaders, 
> a position he still holds. He resigned from the board in 2020.
>
> Over time, Gates reduced his role at Microsoft to focus on his philanthropic work 
> with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable organization, 
> which he and his then-wife Melinda French Gates co-chaired from 2000 until 2024. 
> Focusing on areas including health, education, and poverty alleviation, 
> Gates became known for his efforts to eradicate transmissible diseases 
> such as tuberculosis, malaria, and polio. 
> After French Gates resigned as co-chair following the couple's divorce, 
> the foundation was renamed the Gates Foundation, with Gates as its sole chair.
>
> Gates is founder and chairman of several other companies, 
> including BEN, Cascade Investment, TerraPower, Gates Ventures, and Breakthrough Energy. 
> In 2010, he and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge, 
> whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy. 
> 
> Named as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century by Time magazine in 1999, 
> he has received numerous other honors and accolades, 
> including a Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
> awarded jointly to him and French Gates in 2016 for their philanthropic work. 
> The subject of several documentary films, 
> he published the first of three planned memoirs, Source Code: My Beginnings, in 2025.
