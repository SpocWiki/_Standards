> fighting through hordes of undead humans and invading demons. 
> The game begins on the moons of Mars and finishes in hell, 
> with the player traversing each level to find its exit or defeat its final boss. 
> It is an early example of 3D graphics in video games, 
> and has enemies and objects as 2D images, 
> a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.
>
> Doom was the third major independent release by id Software, 
> after Commander Keen (1990â€“1991) and Wolfenstein 3D (1992). 
> In May 1992, id started developing a darker game 
> focused on fighting demons with technology, 
> using a new 3D game engine from the lead programmer, John Carmack. 
> 
> The designer Tom Hall initially wrote a science fiction plot, 
> but he and most of the story were removed from the project, 
> with the final game featuring an action-heavy design by John Romero and Sandy Petersen. 
> 
> Id published Doom as a set of three episodes under the shareware model, 
> marketing the full game by releasing the first episode free. 
> A retail version with an additional episode was published in 1995 
> by GT Interactive as The Ultimate Doom.

> and is regarded as one of the most important games in the genre. 
> 
> It has been cited by video game historians as 
> shifting the direction and public perception of the medium as a whole, 
> as well as sparking the rise of online games and communities.
