> a technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.
>

> focused on fighting demons with technology, 
> using a new 3D game engine from the lead programmer, John Carmack. 
> 
> The designer Tom Hall initially wrote a science fiction plot, 
> but he and most of the story were removed from the project, 
> with the final game featuring an action-heavy design by John Romero and Sandy Petersen. 
>

> marketing the full game by releasing the first episode free.
