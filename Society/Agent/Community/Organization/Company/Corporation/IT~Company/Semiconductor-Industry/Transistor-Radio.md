# [[Transistor-Radio]] 

> A transistor radio is a small portable radio receiver that uses [[../../../../../../../../Technology/Engineering/Electrical_Engineering/Electronics/Electronic_Component/Transistor]]-based circuitry. 
> Following the invention of the transistor in 1947—
> which revolutionized the field of consumer electronics 
> by introducing small but powerful, convenient hand-held devices—
> the Regency TR-1 was released in 1954 becoming the first commercial transistor radio. 
> 
> The mass-market success of the smaller and cheaper Sony TR-63, released in 1957, 
> led to the transistor radio becoming 
> the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s and 1970s.

> Transistor radios are still commonly used as car radios.

The use of transistors instead of [vacuum tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube") as the amplifier elements 
meant that the device was much smaller, required far less power to operate 
than a tube radio, and was more resistant to physical shock. 
It also allowed "instant-on" operation, since there were no filaments to heat up.

In contrast to heavy not-so-portable Tube Radios, 
the Transistor-Radios used a 9V Block Battery (invented for this purpose) 
and thus fit into the Pocket.
