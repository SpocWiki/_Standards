# [[Texas_Instruments]] 

> Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is an American semiconductor company 
> headquartered in [[Dallas,Texas]] 
> that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits.  
> 
> It is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies worldwide based on sales volume. 
> The company's focus is on developing analog chips and embedded processors, 
> which account for more than 80% of its revenue. 
> 
> TI also produces TI digital light processing technology 
> and education technology products including calculators, microcontrollers, 
> and multi-core processors. 
> The company holds 45,000 patents worldwide as of 2016.
>
> Texas Instruments emerged in 1951 after a reorganization of Geophysical Service Inc, 
> a company founded in 1930 that manufactured equipment for use 
> in the seismic industry, as well as defense electronics. 
> 
> TI entered the [defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(military) "Defense (military)") electronics market in 1942 with submarine detection equipment, 
> based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry.
> 
> TI produced the world's first commercial silicon transistor in 1954, 
> and the same year designed and manufactured the first [[Transistor-Radio]]. 
> 
> [[../../../../../../../../Science/Inventor/Kilby,Jack]] invented the integrated circuit in 1958

In early 1952, Texas Instruments purchased a patent license 
to produce germanium [[../../../../../../../../Technology/Engineering/Electrical_Engineering/Electronics/Electronic_Component/Transistor]]s from [Western Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric "Western Electric"), 
the manufacturing arm of AT&T, for US$25,000, 
beginning production by the end of the year. 

Haggerty brought [Gordon Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Teal "Gordon Teal") to the company due to his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals while at [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories "Bell Telephone Laboratories"). 
Teal's first assignment was to direct TI's research laboratory. 
At the end of 1952, Texas Instruments announced 
that it had expanded to 2,000 employees and $17 million in sales.

Among his new hires was [Willis Adcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Adcock "Willis Adcock"), who joined TI early in 1953. 
Adcock, who like Teal was a [physical chemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemist "Physical chemist"), began leading a small research group 
focused on the task of fabricating grown-junction, [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"), single-crystal, 
small-signal transistors. Adcock later became the first TI Principal Fellow. 

[[../../../../../../../../Science/Inventor/Kilby,Jack]], an employee at TI, invented the [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") in 1958.
Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, 
and successfully demonstrated the world's first working integrated circuit on 1958-09-12.
Six months later, [Robert Noyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce "Robert Noyce") of [Fairchild Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor") 
(who went on to co-found [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel")) 
independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect, 
and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit.
Noyce's chip, made at Fairchild, was made of silicon, while Kilby's chip was made of [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium").

The [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series") of [[TTL(Transistor-Transistor_Logic)]] chips, 
developed by Texas Instruments in the 1960s, 
popularized the use of integrated circuits in computer logic.
