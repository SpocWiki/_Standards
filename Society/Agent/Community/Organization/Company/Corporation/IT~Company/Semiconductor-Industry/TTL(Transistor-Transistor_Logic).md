# [[TTL(Transistor-Transistor_Logic)]] 

#has_/Voltage :: 5
This Voltage (which can often be substituted by 3.6 V, i.e. 3 NiCd Cells) is ubiquitous 
also in USB Buses. 
Bipolar Transistors have high Currents in Rest-Mode, 
which accounts for considerable Heat-Production in TTL Devices. 

> Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. 
> Its name signifies that transistors perform both 
> the logic function (the first "transistor") 
> and the amplifying function (the second "transistor"), 
> as opposed to earlier resistor–transistor logic (RTL) 
> and diode–transistor logic (DTL).
>
> TTL integrated circuits (ICs) were widely used in applications such as computers, 
> industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, 
> and synthesizers.
>
> After their introduction in integrated circuit form in 1963 by Sylvania Electric Products, 
> TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies.  
> 
> The 7400 series by Texas Instruments became particularly popular. 
> TTL manufacturers offered a wide range of logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and other circuits. 
> Variations of the original TTL circuit design offered higher speed 
> or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. 
> 
> TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic dual in-line package(s) and in flat-pack form. 
> Some TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount technology packages.
>
> TTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics. 
> Even after Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) 
> CMOS integrated circuit microprocessors made multiple-chip processors obsolete, 
> TTL devices still found extensive use as glue logic 
> interfacing between more densely integrated components.
