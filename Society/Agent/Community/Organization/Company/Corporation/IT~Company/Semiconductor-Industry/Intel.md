> **Intel** Corporation is an American multinational 
> corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, 
> and incorporated in Delaware. 
> 
> Intel is one of the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue 
> and ranked in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations 
> by revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years, 
> until it was removed from the ranking in 2018. 
> In 2020, it was reinstated and ranked 45th, 
> being the 7th-largest technology company in the ranking.
>
> Intel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems, 
> and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets 
> found in most personal computers (PCs). 
> 
> It also manufactures chipsets, network interface controllers, flash memory, 
> graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), 
> and other devices related to communications and computing. 
> 
> Intel has a strong presence in the high-performance general-purpose 
> and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs, 
> whose high-end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs, 
> as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs, and sponsors the Intel Extreme Masters, 
> a series of international esports tournaments. 
> 
> The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, 
> and supports other open source projects such as Wayland, Mesa, 
> Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.
>
> Intel (Integrated electronics) was founded on 1968-07-18, 
> by semiconductor pioneers [[Intel/Moore,Gordon]] (of Moore's law) and [[Intel/Noyce,Robert]], 
> along with investor Arthur Rock, 
> and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of [[Intel/Grove,Andrew]]. 
> 
> The company was a key component 
> of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center, 
> as well as being an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, 
> which represented the majority of its business until 1981. 
> 
> Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, 
> it was not until the success of the PC in the early 1990s 
> that this became its primary business.
>
> During the 1990s, the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel, 
> known as "Wintel", became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape 
> and solidified Intel's position on the market. 
> 
> As a result, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs 
> in the mid to late 1990s, fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. 
> During this period, it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors 
> and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics 
> in defense of its market position, particularly against AMD, 
> as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry. 
>
> Since the 2000s and especially the late 2010s, 
> Intel has faced increasing competition from AMD, 
> resulting in a significant decline of its dominance and market share in the PC market. 
> 
> Nevertheless, with a 68.4% market share as of 2023, 
> Intel still leads the x86 market by a wide margin.
