> Silicon Valley is a region in Northern California 
> that is a global center for high technology and innovation. 
> 
> Located in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, 
> it corresponds roughly to the geographical area of the Santa Clara Valley. 
> The term "Silicon Valley" refers to the area 
> in which high-tech business has proliferated in Northern California, 
> and it also serves as a general metonym for California's high-tech business sector. 
>
> The cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto and Menlo Park 
> are frequently cited as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. 
> 
> San Jose is Silicon Valley's largest city, the third-largest in California, 
> and the 12th-most populous in the United States. 
> 
> Other major Silicon Valley cities include Santa Clara, Redwood City and Cupertino. 
> The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world 
> (after Zürich, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution. 
> As of June 2021, it also had the highest percentage of 
> homes valued at $1 million or more in the United States.
>
> Silicon Valley is home to many of the world's largest high-tech corporations, 
> including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000, 
> and thousands of startup companies. 
> Silicon Valley also accounts for 
> one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States, 
> which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem 
> for high-tech innovation, although the tech ecosystem has recently become more geographically dispersed. It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the microcomputer, among other technologies, were developed. As of 2021, the region employed about a half million information technology workers.
>
> As more high-tech companies were established 
> across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, 
> and then north towards the Bay Area's two other major cities, 
> San Francisco and Oakland, the term "Silicon Valley" came to have two definitions: 
> a narrower geographic one, referring to Santa Clara County and southeastern San Mateo County, 
> and a metonymical definition referring to high-tech businesses in the entire Bay Area. 
> 
> The term Silicon Valley is often used as a synecdoche 
> for the American high-technology economic sector. 
> The name also became 
> a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, 
> and thus inspired similarly named locations, 
> as well as research parks and technology centers with comparable structures 
> all around the world. 
> Many headquarters of tech companies in Silicon Valley 
> have become hotspots for tourism.
