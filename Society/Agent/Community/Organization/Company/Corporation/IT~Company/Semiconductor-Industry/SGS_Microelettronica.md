# [[SGS_Microelettronica]] 

SGS Microelettronica originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies:

- ATES (Aquila Tubi e Semiconduttori), 
  a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in [L'Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Aquila "L'Aquila"), 
  the regional capital of the region of [Abruzzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abruzzo "Abruzzo") in [Southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy"), 
  which in 1961 changed its name to Azienda Tecnica ed Elettronica del Sud and 
  relocated its manufacturing plant in the Industrial Zone of [Catania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catania "Catania"), in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily");
- Società Generale Semiconduttori (founded in 1957 by Jewish-Italian engineer, politician, and [industrialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialist "Industrialist") [Adriano Olivetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_Olivetti "Adriano Olivetti")).
