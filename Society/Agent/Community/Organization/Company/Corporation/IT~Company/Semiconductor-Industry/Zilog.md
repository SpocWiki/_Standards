# [[Zilog]]  

#has_/time_/started :: 1974-06-01
#has_/creator :: [[Faggin,Federico]] 

> **Zilog**, Inc. is an American manufacturer of microprocessors and 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. It is also a supplier of application-specific embedded system-on-chip (SoC) products.
>
> Its most famous product is the Z80 series of 8-bit microprocessors that were compatible with the Intel 8080 but significantly cheaper. The Z80 was widely used during the 1980s in many popular home computers such as the TRS-80, MSX, Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum, as well as arcade games such as Pac-Man. The company also made 16- and 32-bit processors, but these did not see widespread use. From the 1990s, the company focused primarily on the microcontroller market.
>
> The name (pronunciation varies) is an acronym of Z integrated logic, also thought of as "Z for the last word of Integrated Logic".  In the oral history interview video which Federico Faggin (co-founder of Zilog) recorded for the Computer History Museum, he pronounced Zilog with a long "i" () consistently.

[Masatoshi Shima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masatoshi_Shima "Masatoshi Shima"), who also worked with Faggin on the 4004 and 8080 at [[Intel]], 
joined Zilog in 1975. 
Ungermann had a falling-out with [[Exxon]] and left Zilog in 1978.
