> **Alstom** SA is a French multinational rolling stock manufacturer 
> which operates worldwide in rail transport markets. 
> It is active in the fields of passenger transportation, signaling, and locomotives, 
> producing high-speed, suburban, regional and urban trains along with trams.
>
> The company and its name (originally spelled Alsthom) was formed by a merger 
> between the electric engineering division of Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Als) and 
> Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston (thom) in 1928. 
> 
> Significant acquisitions later included the Constructions Électriques de France (1932), 
> shipbuilder Chantiers de l'Atlantique (1976), and parts of ACEC (late-1980s).
>
> A merger with parts of the British General Electric Company formed GEC Alsthom in 1989. 
> Throughout the 1990s, the company expanded its holdings in the rail sector, 
> acquiring German rolling stock manufacturer Linke-Hofmann-Busch 
> and Italian rail signaling specialist Sasib Railways. 
> In 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and, 
> later that year, it was rebranded Alstom. 
> At the time, the company was manufacturing railway rolling stock, 
> power generation equipment and ships.
>
> In 2003, the company required a €3.2 billion bailout from the French government. 
> As a result, Alstom was compelled to dispose of several of its divisions, 
> including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Areva, 
> in order to comply with European Union rules on state aid. 
> In 2004, Alstom remained in financial difficulties, 
> having incurred massive unexpected costs (€4 billion) 
> arising from a design flaw inherited from the acquisition of [[ABB]]'s turbine business, 
> in addition to losses in other business sectors.
>
> In 2014, General Electric (GE) announced that it reached a deal 
> to purchase Alstom's power and grid divisions for US$17 billion (€12.4 billion). 
> 
> The deal came under heavy scrutiny from French regulators 
> who saw the business as a strategically important domestic industry. 
> To secure approval, GE agreed to form joint ventures with French companies 
> in power generation and transmission, 
> Alstom's heavy gas turbine business was sold to Ansaldo Energia, 
> and GE agreed to sell Alstom's rail signalling business. 
> The deal was finalised in November 2015; 
> since then, Alstom has been operating solely in the rail sector.
>
> In an attempt to grow its rail business, in late-2017, 
> Alstom announced a proposed merger with [[Siemens~Mobility]]. 
> However, in February 2019, the European Commission prohibited the merger. 
> Subsequently, in February 2020, the company signed a letter of agreement 
> to purchase the transportation division of the financially struggling [[Bombardier_Inc]]. 
> The purchase was finalized in January 2021.
