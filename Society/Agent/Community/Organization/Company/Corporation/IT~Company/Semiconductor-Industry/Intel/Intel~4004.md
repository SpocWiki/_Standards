# [[Intel~4004]] 



> The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) 
> released by Intel Corporation in 1971. 
> 
> Sold for US$60 (equivalent to $450 in 2023), 
> it was the first commercially produced microprocessor, 
> and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs.
>
> The 4004 was the first significant example of large-scale integration, 
> showcasing the superiority of the MOS silicon gate technology (SGT). 
> 
> Compared to the incumbent technology, 
> the SGT integrated on the same chip area twice the number of transistors 
> with five times the operating speed. 
> 
> This step-function increase in performance made possible a single-chip CPU, 
> replacing the existing multi-chip CPUs. 
> 
> The innovative 4004 chip design served as a model 
> on how to use the SGT for complex logic and memory circuits, 
> thus accelerating the adoption of the SGT by the world's semiconductor industry. 
> The developer of the original SGT at Fairchild was [[Faggin,Federico]], 
> who designed the first commercial integrated circuit (IC) 
> that used the new technology, 
> proving its superiority for analog/digital applications (Fairchild 3708 in 1968). 
> He later used the SGT at Intel 
> to obtain the unprecedented integration necessary to make the 4004.
>
> The project traces its history to 1969, when Busicom Corp. approached Intel 
> to design a family of seven chips for an electronic calculator, 
> three of which constituted a CPU 
> specialized for making different calculating machines. 
> The CPU was based on data stored on shift-registers 
> and instructions stored on ROM (read only memory). 
> 
> The complexity of the three-chip CPU logic design led Marcian Hoff 
> to propose a more conventional CPU architecture 
> based on data stored on RAM (random-access memory). 
> 
> This architecture was much simpler and more general-purpose 
> and could potentially be integrated into a single chip, 
> thus reducing the cost and improving the speed. 
> 
> Design began in April 1970 under the direction of Faggin, 
> aided by Masatoshi Shima, who contributed to the architecture 
> and later to the logic design. 
> 
> The first delivery of a fully operational 4004 was in March 1971 to Busicom 
> for its 141-PF printing calculator engineering prototype 
> (now displayed in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California). 
> General sales began July 1971.
>
> A number of innovations developed by Faggin 
> while working at Fairchild Semiconductor 
> allowed the 4004 to be produced on a single chip. 
> 
> The main concept was the use of the self-aligned gate, 
> made of polysilicon rather than metal, 
> which allowed the components to be much closer together 
> and work at higher speed. 
> 
> To make the 4004 possible, Faggin also developed the "bootstrap load", 
> considered unfeasible with silicon gate, and the "buried contact" 
> that allowed the silicon gates to be connected directly 
> to the source and drain of the transistors without the use of metal. 
> 
> Together, these innovations doubled the circuit density, and thus halved cost, allowing a single chip to contain 2,300 transistors and run five times faster 
> than designs using the previous MOS technology with aluminum gates.
>
> The 4004 design was later improved by Faggin as the Intel 4040 in 1974. 
> The Intel 8008 and 8080 were unrelated designs in spite of the similar naming.
