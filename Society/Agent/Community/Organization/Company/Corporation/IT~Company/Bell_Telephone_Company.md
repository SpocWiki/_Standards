> The Bell System was a system of telecommunication companies, 
> led by the Bell Telephone Company 
> and later by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company ([[AT&T]]), 
> that dominated the telephone services industry in North America for over 100 years 
> from its creation in 1877 until its antitrust breakup in 1983. 
> 
> The system of companies was often colloquially called Ma Bell (as in "Mother Bell"), 
> as it held a vertical monopoly over telecommunication products and services 
> in most areas of the United States and Canada. 
> 
> At the time of the breakup of the Bell System in the early 1980s, 
> it had assets of $150 billion (equivalent to $440 billion in 2023) 
> and employed over one million people.
>
> Beginning in the 1910s, American antitrust regulators had been observing and accusing the Bell System 
> of abusing its monopoly power, and had brought legal action multiple times over the decades. 
> 
> In 1974 the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against Bell 
> claiming violations of the Sherman Act. 
> 
> In 1982, anticipating that it could not win, AT&T agreed to a Justice Department-mandated consent decree 
> that settled the lawsuit and ordered it to break itself up into seven "Regional Bell Operating Companies" 
> (known as "The Baby Bells"). This ended the existence of the conglomerate in 1984. 
> 
> The Baby Bells became independent companies and several of them are large corporations today.

AT&T started with [Bell Patent Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Patent_Association "Bell Patent Association"), a legal entity established in 1874 
to protect the patent rights o[[../../../../../../../../Knowledge/Science/Scientist/Bell,Alexander_Graham]] after he invented the telephone system. 

Originally a verbal agreement, it was formalized in writing in 1875 as [Bell Telephone Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Company "Bell Telephone Company").

In 1877, the American Bell Telephone Company, named after [Alexander Graham Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell "Alexander Graham Bell"), 
opened the first telephone exchange in [New Haven, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut "New Haven, Connecticut"). 
Within a few years [local exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange "Telephone exchange") companies were established in every major city in the United States.

In 1899, American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) acquired the assets of its parent, the American Bell Telephone Company. 
American Bell had created AT&T to provide long-distance calls between New York and Chicago and beyond. 
AT&T became the parent of American Bell Telephone Company, and thus the head of the Bell System, 
because regulatory and tax rules were leaner in New York than in Boston, where American Bell was headquartered.
