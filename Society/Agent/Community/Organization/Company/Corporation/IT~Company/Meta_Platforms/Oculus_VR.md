Oculus Rift was founded as a [[Kickstarter]] Initiative and bought 2 years later for 2.3 mio 

Coincidentally,[[../id_Software/Carmack,John_D]]] of [id Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software "Id Software") had been doing his research on HMDs 
and happened upon Palmer's developments. 
After sampling an early unit, Carmack favored Luckey's prototype, 
and just before the 2012 [Electronic Entertainment Expo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo "Electronic Entertainment Expo") (E3), 
id Software announced that the _[BFG Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3_BFG_Edition "Doom 3 BFG Edition")_ of _[Doom 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_3 "Doom 3")_ 
would be compatible with head-mounted display units.

Carmack later left id Software as he was hired as Oculus VR's [chief technology officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer "Chief technology officer")
