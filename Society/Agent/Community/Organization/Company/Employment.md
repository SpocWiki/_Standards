> **Employment** is a relationship between two parties regulating the provision of paid labour services.  
> Usually based on a contract, one party, the employer, which might be a corporation, 
> a not-for-profit organization, a co-operative, or any other entity, 
> pays the other, the employee, in return for carrying out assigned work. 
> 
> Employees work in return for wages, which can be paid on the basis of an hourly rate, 
> by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does, 
> the prevailing conditions of the sector and the bargaining power between the parties. 
> 
> Employees in some sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payments or stock options. 
> In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. 
> Benefits may include health insurance, housing, and disability insurance. 
> Employment is typically governed by employment laws, organization or legal contracts.
