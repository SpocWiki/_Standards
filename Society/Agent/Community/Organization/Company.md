> A **Company**, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an association of legal people, 
> whether natural, juridical or a mixture of both, with a specific objective. 
> Company members share a common purpose and unite to achieve specific, declared goals.
>
> Over time, companies have evolved to have the following features: 
> "separate legal personality, limited liability, transferable shares, investor ownership, 
> and a managerial hierarchy". 
> The company, as an entity, was created by the state which granted the privilege of incorporation.
>
> Companies take various forms, such as:
> - voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations
> - business entities, whose aim is to generate sales, revenue, and profit
> - financial entities and banks
> - programs or educational institutions
>
> A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability 
> as members perform or fail to discharge their duties 
> according to the publicly declared incorporation published policy. 
> 
> When a company closes, it may need to be liquidated to avoid further legal obligations. 
> Companies may associate and collectively register themselves as new companies; 
> the resulting entities are often known as corporate groups, 
> collections of parent and subsidiary corporations.
