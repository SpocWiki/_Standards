> Foster care is a system in which a minor has been placed into a ward, 
> group home (residential child care community or treatment centre), 
> or private home of a state-certified caregiver, referred to as a "foster parent", 
> or with a family member approved by the state. 
> 
> The placement of a "foster child" is normally arranged through the government or a social service agency. 
> The institution, group home, or foster parent is compensated for expenses unless with a family member. 
> Any adult who has spent time in care can be described as a "care leaver", especially in European countries. 
>
> The state, via the family court and child protective services agency, stand in loco parentis to the minor, 
> making all legal decisions while the foster parent is responsible for the day-to-day care of the minor.
>
> Scholars and activists have expressed concerns 
> about the efficacy of foster care services provided by non-government organisations. 
> Specifically, this pertains to poor retention rates of social workers. 
> Poor retention rates are attributed to being overworked in an emotionally draining field 
> that offers minimal monetary compensation. 
> 
> The lack of professionals pursuing a degree in social work 
> coupled with poor retention rates in the field has led to a shortage of social workers 
> and created large caseloads for those who choose to work and stay in the field.  
> The efficacy of caseworker retention also affects the overall ability to care for clients. 
> Low staffing leads to data limitations 
> that infringe on caseworkers' ability to adequately serve clients and their families.
>
> Foster care is correlated with a range of negative outcomes compared to the general population. 
> Children in foster care have a high rate of ill health, 
> particularly psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. 
> One third of foster children in a US study 
> reported abuse from a foster parent or other adult in the foster home. 
> Nearly half of foster children in the US become homeless when they reach the age of 18, 
> and the poverty rate is three times higher among foster care alumni than in the general population.
