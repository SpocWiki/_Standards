> A **Parent** is either the progenitor of a child or, in humans, 
> it can refer to a caregiver or legal guardian, 
> generally called an adoptive parent or step-parent.  
> 
> Parents who are progenitors are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. 
> A female can also become a parent through surrogacy. 
> Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, 
> but are not related to the child. 
> 
> Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents 
> or other family members.
>
> A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation. 
> With recent medical advances, 
> it is possible to have more than two biological parents. 
> 
> Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material.
>
> The most common types of parents are 
> mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents. 
> 
> A mother is "a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth." 
> The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent 
> to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, 
> however one that exhibits too little involvement is said to exhibit child neglect, 
> while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive.
