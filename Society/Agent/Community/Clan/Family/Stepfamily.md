> A **Stepfamily** (sometimes called a bonus family) is a family 
> where at least one parent has children who are not biologically related to their spouse. 
> 
> Either parent, or both, may have children from previous relationships or marriages. 
> Two known classifications for stepfamilies include "simple" stepfamilies, 
> where only one member of the family's couple has a prior child or children 
> and the couple does not have any children together, and "complex" or "blended" families, 
> where both members of the couple have at least one child from another relationship.
