> In common terminology, a baby is the very young offspring of adult human beings, 
> while infant (from the Latin word infans, meaning 'baby' or 'child') 
> is a formal or specialised synonym. 
> 
> The terms may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms. 
> A newborn is, in colloquial use, a baby who is only hours, days, or weeks old; 
> while in medical contexts, a newborn or **Neonate** (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) 
> is an infant in the first 28 days after birth 
> (the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants).
>
> Infants born prior to 37 weeks of gestation are called "premature", 
> those born between 39 and 40 weeks are "full term", 
> those born through 41 weeks are "late term", 
> and anything beyond 42 weeks is considered "post term".
>
> Before birth, the offspring is called a fetus. 
> 
> The term infant is typically applied to very young children under one year of age; 
> however, definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age. 
> When a human child learns to walk, they are appropriately called a toddler instead.
