## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Orphan** is a child whose parents have died, are unknown, or have permanently abandoned them. 
> It can also refer to a child who has lost only one parent, 
> as the Hebrew translation, for example, is "fatherless". 
> 
> In some languages, such as Swedish, the term is "parentless" 
> and more ambiguous about whether the parents are dead, unknown or absconded, 
> but typically refers to a child or younger adult.
>
> In common usage, only a child who has lost both parents due to death is called an orphan. 
> When referring to animals, only the mother's condition is usually relevant 
> (i.e., if the female parent has gone, the offspring is an orphan, regardless of the father's condition).
