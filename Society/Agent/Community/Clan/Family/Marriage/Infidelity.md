> **Infidelity** (synonyms include cheating, having an affair, adultery, 
> being unfaithful, non-consensual non-monogamy, straying or two-timing) 
> is a violation of a couple's emotional or sexual exclusivity 
> that commonly results in feelings of anger, sexual jealousy, and rivalry.
>
> What constitutes infidelity depends on expectations within the relationship. 
> In marital relationships, exclusivity is commonly assumed. 
> 
> Infidelity can cause psychological damage, including feelings of rage and betrayal, 
> depression, low sexual and personal confidence, and even post-traumatic stress disorder. 
> 
> People of both sexes can experience social consequences 
> if their act of infidelity becomes public, 
> but the form and extent of these consequences can depend on the gender of the unfaithful person.
