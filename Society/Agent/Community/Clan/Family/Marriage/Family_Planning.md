## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Family planning is the consideration of the number of children a person wishes to have, 
> including the choice to have no children, and the age at which they wish to have them. 
> 
> Things that may play a role on family planning decisions include marital situation, 
> career or work considerations, or financial situations. 
> 
> If sexually active, family planning may involve the use of contraception (birth control) 
> and other techniques to control the timing of reproduction.
>
> Other aspects of family planning aside from contraception include sex education, 
> prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections, 
> pre-conception counseling and management, and infertility management. 
> 
> Family planning, as defined by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, 
> encompasses services leading up to conception. 
> Abortion is another form of family planning, although it's not a primary one.
>
> Family planning is sometimes used as a 
> synonym or euphemism for access to and the use of contraception. 
> However, it often involves methods and practices in addition to contraception. 
> 
> Additionally, many might wish to use contraception but are not necessarily planning a family 
> (e.g., unmarried adolescents, young married couples delaying childbearing while building a career). 
> Family planning has become a catch-all phrase for much of the work undertaken in this realm. 
> 
> However, contemporary notions of family planning 
> tend to place a woman and her childbearing decisions at the center of the discussion, 
> as notions of women's empowerment 
> and reproductive autonomy have gained traction in many parts of the world. 
> 
> It is usually applied to a female-male couple who wish to limit the number of children they have 
> or control pregnancy timing (also known as spacing children).
>
> Family planning has been shown to reduce teenage birth rates and birth rates for unmarried women.
>
> It is possible and sometimes clarifying to separate the term family planning from family planning program. 
> One textbook defines the former as "attempts by couples to regulate the number and spacing of their births", and the latter as "a systematic effort, often government-sponsored, to provide the information, supplies, and services for modern fertility control". The programs, used by many developing countries between 1950 and 1995, are controversial because of coercion primarily in China, India and Peru, while a report from the World Bank concluded that “for the most part, the family planning program ‘experiment’ worked: policy and program interventions contributed substantially to the revolutionary rise of contraceptive use and to the decline in fertility that has occurred in the developing world”.
