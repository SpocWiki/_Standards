> **Courtship** is the period when some couples become familiar with each other 
> prior to a possible marriage or committed romantic, de facto relationship. 
> 
> Courtship traditionally may begin after a betrothal 
> and may conclude with the celebration of marriage. 
> 
> A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people 
> or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval. 
> 
> Traditionally, in the case of a formal cisnormative heterosexual engagement, 
> it is the role of a male to actively "court" or "woo" a female, 
> thus encouraging the female to be receptive to a marriage proposal.
>
> Courtship as a social practice is a relatively recent phenomenon, 
> emerging only within the last few centuries. 
> 
> From the standpoint of anthropology and sociology, 
> courtship is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family which have changed rapidly, 
> having been subject to the effects of advances in technology and medicine. 
>
> In non-human animals, courtship refers to sexual behavior that precedes copulation.
