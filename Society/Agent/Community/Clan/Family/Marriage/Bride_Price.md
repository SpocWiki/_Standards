> is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family 
> to the woman or the family of the woman he will be married to or is just about to marry.

> Bride dowry is equivalent to dowry paid to the groom in some cultures, 
> or used by the bride to help establish the new household, 
> and dower, which is property settled on the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage.

> the Middle East, parts of Africa and in some Pacific Island societies, notably those in Melanesia. 
> The amount changing hands may range from a token to continue the traditional ritual, 
> to many thousands of US dollars in some marriages in Thailand, 
> and as much as $100,000 in exceptionally large bride dowry in parts of Papua New Guinea 
> where bride dowry is customary.
