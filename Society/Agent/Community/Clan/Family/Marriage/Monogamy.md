> **Monogamy** ( mə-NOG-ə-mee) is a relationship of two individuals 
> in which they form a mutual and exclusive intimate partnership. 
> 
> Having only one partner at any one time, whether for life or serial monogamy, 
> contrasts with various forms of non-monogamy (e.g., polygamy or polyamory). 
>
> The term monogamy, derived from Greek for "one marriage," 
> has multiple context-dependent meanings—genetic, sexual, social, and marital—
> each varying in interpretation across cultures and disciplines, 
> making its definition complex and often debated. 
> 
> The term is typically used to describe the behavioral ecology and sexual selection of animal mating systems, referring to the state of having only one mate at any one given time. In a human cultural context, monogamy typically refers to the custom of two individuals, regardless of orientation, committing to a sexually exclusive relationship.
>
> Monogamy in humans varies widely across cultures and definitions. While only a minority of societies are strictly monogamous, many practice serial monogamy or tolerate extramarital sex. Genetic monogamy is relatively unstudied and often contradicted by evidence of extrapair paternity.  Monogamy in humans likely evolved through a combination of biological factors such as the need for paternal care and ecological pressures, alongside cultural developments like agriculture, property inheritance, and religious or societal norms promoting social stability.
>
> Biologists distinguish between social, sexual, and genetic monogamy to reflect how animal pairings may involve cohabitation, sexual exclusivity, and reproductive fidelity in varying combinations, while serial monogamy describes successive exclusive relationships over time.
