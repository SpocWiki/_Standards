## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Polygamy** (from Late Greek πολυγαμία polygamía, "state of marriage to many spouses") 
> is the practice of marrying multiple spouses. 
> When a man is married to more than one wife at the same time, it is called polygyny. 
> When a woman is married to more than one husband at the same time, it is called polyandry. 
> In contrast, in sociobiology and zoology, researchers use "polygamy" more broadly to refer to any form of multiple mating.
>
> In contrast to polygamy, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties. 
> Like "monogamy", the term "polygamy" is often used in a de facto sense, 
> applied regardless of whether a state recognizes the relationship.  In many countries, the law only recognises monogamous marriages (a person can only have one spouse, and bigamy is illegal), but adultery is not illegal, leading to a situation of de facto polygamy being allowed without legal recognition for non-official "spouses".
>
> Worldwide, different societies variously encourage, accept or outlaw polygamy. In societies which allow or tolerate polygamy, polygyny is the accepted form in the vast majority of cases. According to the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, of 1,231 societies noted from 1960 to 1980, 588 had frequent polygyny, 453 had occasional polygyny, 186 were monogamous, and 4 had polyandry – although more recent research found some form of polyandry in 53 communities, which is more common than previously thought. In cultures which practice polygamy, its prevalence among that population often correlates with social class and socioeconomic status. Polygamy (taking the form of polygyny) is most common in a region known as the "polygamy belt" in West Africa and Central Africa, with the countries estimated to have the highest polygamy prevalence in the world being Burkina Faso, Mali, Gambia, Niger and Nigeria.
