## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A marriage of convenience  is a marriage contracted 
> for reasons other than that of love and commitment. 
> 
> Instead, such a marriage is entered into for personal gain, 
> or some other sort of strategic purpose, such as a political marriage. 
> Cases where those married do not intend to live together as a couple, 
> and typically married only for one of them to gain the right to reside in a country, 
> are considered to be sham marriages. 
> 
> In many cultures, it is usual for parents to decide their adult children's marriages; 
> this is called an arranged marriage.
>
> In ancient Roman Egypt (30 BCE to 395 CE), brother-sister marriages were common, 
> comprising an estimated 15â€“21% of unions, often to keep property within the family.
>
> Marriages of convenience that are sham, and arranged marriages that are forced, 
> are against the law in many jurisdictions.
