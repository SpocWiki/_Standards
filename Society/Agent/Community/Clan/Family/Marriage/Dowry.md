## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Dowry** is a payment such as land, property, money, livestock, or a commercial asset 
> that is paid by the bride's (woman's) family to the groom (man) or his family at the time of marriage.
>
> Dowry contrasts with the related concepts of bride price and dower. 
> While bride price 
> or bride service is a payment by the groom, or his family, to the bride, or her family, 
> dowry is the wealth transferred from the bride, or her family, to the groom, or his family.  
> Similarly, dower is the property settled on the bride herself, by the groom at the time of marriage, 
> and which remains under her ownership and control.
>
> Traditional dowry is an ancient custom that is mentioned in some of the earliest writings, and its existence may well predate records of it. Dowries continue to be expected and demanded as a condition to accept a marriage proposal in some parts of the world, mainly in parts of Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in strongly patrilineal cultures that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family (patrilocality). Dowries have long histories in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world.
