> A widow (female) or widower (male) is a person whose spouse has died and has not remarried. The male form, "widower", is first attested in the 14th century, by the 19th century supplanting "widow" with reference to men. 
> The adjective for either sex is widowed. 
> 
> These terms are not applied to a divorcé(e) following the death of an ex-spouse.
>
> The state of having lost one's spouse to death is termed **Widowhood**. 
> The term widowhood can be used for either sex, according to some dictionaries, 
> but the word widowerhood is also listed in some dictionaries.
