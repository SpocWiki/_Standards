## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A virtual community is a social network of individuals 
> who connect through specific social media, 
> potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries 
> in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. 
> 
> Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are online communities 
> operating under social networking services.
>
> Howard Rheingold discussed virtual communities in his book, The Virtual Community, 
> published in 1993. 
> 
> The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on The WELL, 
> computer-mediated communication, social groups and information science. 
> 
> Technologies cited include Usenet, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) 
> and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), 
> chat rooms and electronic mailing lists. 
> 
> Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, 
> as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community. 
> At the same time, it showed that job engagement 
> positively influences virtual communities of practice engagement.
>
> Virtual communities all encourage interaction, 
> sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. 
> Some virtual communities do both. 
> 
> Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion 
> through various means: message boards, chat rooms, 
> social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds. 
> 
> Members usually become attached to the community world, 
> logging in and out on sites all day every day, which can certainly become an addiction.
