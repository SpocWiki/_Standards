## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dating** is a stage of romantic relationships in which individuals engage in activity together, 
> often with the intention of evaluating each other's suitability as a partner in a future intimate relationship. 
> It falls into the category of courtship, consisting of social events carried out by the couple either alone or with others.
>
> The first date is considered important, sometimes for making a good first impression, or because dating may lead to a more serious relationship, or a breakup, or friendzoning. If the relationship progresses, the next steps may include meeting the parents or other family and eventually cohabitation, engagement and marriage. Even after the relationship develops, couples still may organize a date or "date night".
>
> With the internet, many dating sites have been created to modernize the personals section of newspapers as a way to find prospective partners. Speed dating, blind dating, and the use of matchmaking are all possible ways of beginning the dating process. Group dating is a modern dating practice especially popular in Japan.
