> **Cult**s are social groups which have unusual, and often extreme, religious, spiritual, 
> or philosophical beliefs and rituals. 
> 
> Extreme devotion to a particular person, object, or goal 
> is another characteristic often ascribed to cults. 
> 
> The term has different, and sometimes divergent or pejorative, definitions 
> both in popular culture and academia 
> and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.
>
> Beginning in the 1930s, new religious movements became an object of sociological study 
> within the context of the study of religious behavior. 
> 
> Since the 1940s, the Christian countercult movement 
> has opposed some sects and new religious movements, 
> labeling them cults because of their unorthodox beliefs. 
> 
> Since the 1970s, the secular anti-cult movement has opposed certain groups, 
> which they call cults, accusing them of practicing brainwashing.
>
> Groups labelled cults are found around the world 
> and range in size from small localized groups 
> to some international organizations with up to millions of members.
