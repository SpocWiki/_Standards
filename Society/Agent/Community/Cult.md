> both in popular culture and academia 
> and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.
>
> Beginning in the 1930s, new religious movements became an object of sociological study 
> within the context of the study of religious behavior. 
> 
> Since the 1940s, the Christian countercult movement 
> has opposed some sects and new religious movements, 
> labeling them cults because of their unorthodox beliefs. 
> 
> Since the 1970s, the secular anti-cult movement has opposed certain groups, 
> which they call cults, accusing them of practicing brainwashing.
>
> Groups labelled cults are found around the world 
> and range in size from small localized groups 
> to some international organizations with up to millions of members.
