> Tor is a free overlay network for enabling anonymous communication. 
> It is built on free and open-source software 
> run by over seven thousand volunteer-operated relays worldwide, 
> as well as by millions of users who route their Internet traffic via random paths through these relays.
>
> Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity 
> by preventing any single point on the Internet (other than the user's device) 
> from being able to view both where traffic originated from 
> and where it is ultimately going to at the same time. 
> 
> This conceals a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance 
> or traffic analysis from any such point, 
> protecting the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially.
