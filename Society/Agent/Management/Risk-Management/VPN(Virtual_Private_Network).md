> A virtual private network (VPN) is an overlay network 
> that uses network virtualization to extend a private network across a public network, 
> such as the Internet, via the use of encryption and tunneling protocols. 
> In a VPN, a tunneling protocol is used 
> to transfer network messages from one network host to another. 
>
> Host-to-network VPNs are commonly used by organisations 
> to allow off-site users secure access to an office network over the internet. 
> 
> Site-to-site VPNs connect two networks, such as an office network and a datacenter. 
> Provider-provisioned VPNs isolate parts of the provider's own network infrastructure 
> in virtual segments to make the contents of each segment private with respect to the others. 
> Individuals also use VPNs to encrypt and anonymize their network traffic, 
> with VPN services selling access to their own private networks.
>
> VPNs can enhance usage privacy by making 
> an ISP unable to access the private data or metadata exchanged across the VPN. 
> Through encryption, VPNs enhance confidentiality and reduce the risk of successful data sniffing attacks.

Similar to the [[Tor-Network]], VPNs operate Servers on most Continents and many Jurisdictions, allowing to access e.g. contents blocked by [[Geofence]].
