> In engineering and systems theory, redundancy 
> is the intentional duplication of critical components or functions of a system 
> with the goal of increasing reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, 
> or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of GNSS receivers, or multi-threaded computer processing.
>
> In many safety-critical systems, such as fly-by-wire and hydraulic systems in aircraft, 
> some parts of the control system may be triplicated, 
> which is formally termed triple modular redundancy (TMR). 
> An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. 
> In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, 
> all three of which must fail before the system fails. 
> 
> Since each one rarely fails, 
> and the sub-components are designed to **preclude common failure modes** 
> (which can then be modelled as independent failure), 
> the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; 
> it is often outweighed by other risk factors, such as human error. 
> 
> Electrical surges arising from lightning strikes are an example of 
> a failure mode which is difficult to fully isolate, 
> unless the components are powered from independent power busses 
> and have no direct electrical pathway in their interconnect 
> (communication by some means is required for voting). 
> This Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems" or "voting logic".

> Redundancy sometimes produces less, instead of greater reliability –  it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglect of duty, and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe.
>
> Redundancy is one form of robustness as practiced in computer science. 
>
> Geographic redundancy has become important in the data center industry, to safeguard data against natural disasters and political instability (see below).
