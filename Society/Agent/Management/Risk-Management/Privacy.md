## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Privacy** is the ability of an individual or group 
> to seclude themselves or information about themselves, 
> and thereby express themselves selectively.
>
> The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, 
> which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. 
> Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.
>
> Throughout history, there have been various conceptions of privacy. 
> Most cultures acknowledge the right of individuals 
> to keep aspects of their personal lives out of the public domain. 
> 
> The right to be free from unauthorized invasions of privacy 
> by governments, corporations, or individuals 
> is enshrined in the privacy laws of many countries 
> and, in some instances, their constitutions.
>
> With the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has expanded 
> from a bodily sense to include a digital sense. 
> In most countries, the right to digital privacy 
> is considered an extension of the original right to privacy, 
> and many countries have passed acts 
> that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities.
>
> There are multiple techniques to invade privacy, 
> which may be employed by corporations or governments for profit or political reasons. 
> Conversely, in order to protect privacy, people may employ encryption or anonymity measures.
