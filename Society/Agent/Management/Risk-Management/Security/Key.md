> A key is a device that is used to operate a lock (to lock or unlock it). 
> A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: 
> - the bit or blade, which slides into the keyway of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, 
> - and the bow, which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. 
> In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, 
> a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key.
>
> The key serves as a security token for access to the locked area; 
> locks are meant to only allow persons having the correct key to open it and gain access. 
> In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, 
> one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock.  
> 
> Common metals include brass, plated brass, nickel silver, and steel. 
> 
> The act of opening a lock without a key is called lock picking.
