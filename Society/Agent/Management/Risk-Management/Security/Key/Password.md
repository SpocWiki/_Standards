## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Password**, sometimes called a passcode, is secret data, 
> typically a string of characters, usually used to confirm a user's identity. 
> 
> Traditionally, passwords were expected to be memorized, 
> but the large number of password-protected services that a typical individual accesses 
> can make memorization of unique passwords for each service impractical. 
> 
> Using the terminology of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines, 
> the secret is held by a party called the claimant 
> while the party verifying the identity of the claimant is called the verifier. 
> 
> When the claimant successfully demonstrates knowledge of the password to the verifier 
> through an established authentication protocol, the verifier is able to infer the claimant's identity.
>
> In general, a password is an arbitrary string of characters 
> including letters, digits, or other symbols. 
> If the permissible characters are constrained to be numeric, 
> the corresponding secret is sometimes called a personal identification number (PIN).
>
> Despite its name, a password does not need to be an actual word; 
> indeed, a non-word (in the dictionary sense) may be harder to guess, 
> which is a desirable property of passwords. 
> 
> A memorized secret consisting of a sequence of words 
> or other text separated by spaces is sometimes called a passphrase. 
> 
> A passphrase is similar to a password in usage, 
> but the former is generally longer for added security.
