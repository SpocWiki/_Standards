## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Security** is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercion). 
> 
> Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be persons and social groups, objects 
> and institutions, ecosystems, or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change. 
>
> Security mostly refers to **protection from hostile forces**, 
> but it has a wide range of other senses, for example:
> - as the absence of harm (e.g., freedom from want); 
> - as the presence of an essential good (e.g., food security); 
> - as resilience against potential damage or harm (e.g. secure foundations); 
> - as secrecy (e.g., a secure telephone line); 
> - as containment (e.g., a secure room or cell); and 
> - as a state of mind (e.g., emotional security).
>
> Security can be physical and virtual.
> Security is both a feeling and a state of reality. 
> One might feel secure when one is not actually so; or might feel insecure despite being safe. 
> This distinction is usually not very clear to express in the English language.
>
> The term is also used to refer to acts and systems whose purpose may be to provide security: 
> - security company, 
> - security police, 
> - security forces, 
> - security service, 
> - security agency, 
> - security guard, 
> - cyber security systems, 
> - security cameras, 
> - remote guarding.
