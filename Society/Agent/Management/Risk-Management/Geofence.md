> A **Geofence** is a virtual "perimeter" or "fence" around a given geographic feature. 
> A geofence can be dynamically generated (as in a radius around a point location) 
> or match a predefined set of boundaries (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries).
>
> The use of a geofence is called geofencing, and one example of use involves 
> a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geofence. 
> 
> This method combines awareness of the user's current location 
> with awareness of the user's proximity to locations that may be of interest. 
> 
> This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user 
> as well as messaging to the geofence operator. 
> This info, which could contain vehicle location data, 
> could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account.
>
> Geofencing is a critical technology in many fields. 
> In fleet management, it is used to automate timekeeping at job sites 
> and to alert managers of unauthorized vehicle use. 
> 
> It is also used in marketing, smart home automation, 
> and public transport information systems. 
> 
> However, the technology has also raised significant privacy concerns, 
> particularly regarding its use by law enforcement 
> to issue geofence warrants to collect data on all individuals within a specific area.
