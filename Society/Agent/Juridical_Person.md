> A juridical person is a legal person that is not a natural person 
> but an organization recognized by law as a fictitious person 
> such as a corporation, government agency, non-governmental organisation, 
> or international organization (such as the European Union). 
> 
> Other terms include artificial person, corporate person, judicial person, 
> juridical entity, juridic person, or juristic person. 
> A juridical person maintains certain duties and rights as enumerated under relevant laws. 
> The rights and responsibilities of a juridical person 
> are distinct from those of the natural persons constituting it.
>
> Since the beginning of writing at the start of recorded history, 
> associations have been known as the original form of the juridical person. 
> This is documented for the 1st century A.D. for Jewish trading companies. 
> 
> In Roman law, entities gained significance through institutions 
> such as the state, communities, corporations (universitates) 
> and their associations of persons and assets, as well as associations. 
> At least three persons were required in Rome to found an association.
