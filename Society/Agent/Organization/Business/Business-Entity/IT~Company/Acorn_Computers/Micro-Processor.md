## History 


First Processors: 
- [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Intel/Intel~4004]] [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Intel]] 

### Intel 4004 
1969 a Team left [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Fairchild_Semiconductor]] to form [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Intel]]. 
[[Fagin,Federico]] left Fairchild some time later 
and consolidated the [[ Intel~4001]] into one [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Intel/Intel~4004]], 
but Sales was slow, because Intel did not focus on Processors. 

### Zilog Z80 
1974 Fagin, [[Shima,Masatoshi]] and [[Ungerman, Ralph]] left Intel to form [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Zilog]],  
but 1974 was a bad Recession year. 
[[Exxon]] invested into the Majority of [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Zilog]]. 

The [[Zilog~Z80]] was compatible with the [[ Intel~8080]], 
but did not need 2 Voltages, only 5V, not 12V. 
Zilog added an unknown Number of Trap-Transistors 
to prevent Competitors from cloning it. 
Eventually, Clones were still produced by [[Sharp]] and [[NEC]]. 

The first Computers to feature a Z80 were 
- [[Sinclair~ZX80]] and [[Sinclair~ZX81]]  followed by the [[Sinclair~ZX-Spectrum]] with Color Graphics. 
- many Gaming Consoles 

 [[Exxon]] aggregating Companies with Computer Know-How and gave [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Zilog]] a hard time until they sold in 1980. 

### IBM 
IBM was worried by the Home Computer Market, but also about Exxon, 
so they turned to [[../Semiconductor-Industry/Intel]] and used their [[ Intel~8086]] Processor for their first PC Design. 

They had [[../Microsoft]] write the OS, but kept the BIOS secret. 
This that was soon reverse-engineered though by [[Phoenix_Technologies]].

> A **Microprocessor** is a computer processor 
> for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. 
> 
> The microprocessor contains all the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry 
> required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). 
> 
> The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations. 
> 
> The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit 
> that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, 
> and provides results (also in binary form) as output. 
> 
> Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, 
> and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.
>
> The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) 
> greatly reduced the cost of processing power. 
> 
> Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers 
> by highly automated metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. 
> 
> Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail. 
> As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip 
> (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock's law.
>
> Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with 
> many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. 
> Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. 
> 
> While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, 
> the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by [[Faggin,Federico]] and introduced in 1971.
>
> Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete, 
> with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices 
> to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.
