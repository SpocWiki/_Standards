> ARM (stylised in lowercase as arm, 
> formerly an acronym for Advanced [[RISC-Processor]] Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) 
> is a family of RISC instruction set architectures (ISAs) for computer processors. 
> 
> Arm Ltd. develops the ISAs and licenses them to other companies, 
> who build the physical devices that use the instruction set. 
> It also designs and licenses cores that implement these ISAs.
>
> Due to their low costs, low power consumption, and low heat generation, 
> ARM processors are useful for light, portable, battery-powered devices, 
> including smartphones, laptops, and tablet computers, as well as embedded systems. 
> 
> However, ARM processors are also used for desktops and servers, 
> including the world's fastest supercomputer (Fugaku) from 2020 to 2022. 
> 
> With over 230 billion ARM chips  produced, as of 2022, ARM is the most widely used family of instruction set architectures. 
> 
> There have been several generations of the ARM design. 
> The original ARM1 used a 32-bit internal structure 
> but had a 26-bit address space that limited it to 64 MB of main memory. 
> This limitation was removed in the ARMv3 series, which has a 32-bit address space, 
> and several additional generations up to ARMv7 remained 32-bit. 
> 
> Released in 2011, the ARMv8-A architecture added support for a 64-bit address space 
> and 64-bit arithmetic with its new __32-bit fixed-length instruction set__. 
> 
> Arm Ltd. has also released a series of additional instruction sets for different rules; 
> the "Thumb" extension adds both 32- and 16-bit instructions for improved code density, 
> while Jazelle added instructions for directly handling Java bytecode. 
> 
> More recent changes include the addition of [[SMT(simultaneous_multithreading)]] 
> for improved performance or fault tolerance.

From 1993 to 1998 Apple was building its [[Apple_Newton]] and needed a low-Power Processor. 
The [[../AT&T]] Hobbit Processor was not reliable and took too much Power.

[[../Semiconductor-Industry/Motorola]] already faced a familiar Manufacturing Problem: 
- Chip Facilities are expensive to operate 
- but they often don't have the expertise to __design__ Chips 

Key Products for ARM were 
- Nokia 6110 
- Nintendo GameBox Advance
