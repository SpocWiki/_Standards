Tags: #IT #URL 
Links: rather use typed Links using [key::link] or (key::link)
 
MetaData: like Created, modified etc. can be extracted from FileVersioning in OS or GIT, not within the same File. 

# Ideas 
* describe the key Ideas in single Sentences and make Headings and a ToC from them 

# 'Outside' File Name Structure is best!
Similar to the File Name being an Abstract of the Contents.
Links are simple preserved when Folder is introduced. 
Moving / zipping Folder loses Details but that may be an advantage. 
* Move file and Folder of same Name together!

## Folder Notes 
3 Methods are discussed: [obsidian-folder-note-plugin/folder-note-methods.md at main Â· xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin (github.com)](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin/blob/main/doc/folder-note-methods.md)
* Index File similar to index.htm or default.htm or .md (not allowed)
* Outside File Name (not moved together)
* Inside File Name (lost within other Files)

# Hints; to be deleted
* Avoid Spaces in the Name; use ~, - or _ although ~ and _ already have MarkDown Meaning. This also allows to use simple #Tags instead of[Open_Links](../../../../../../../Data/Open_Links.md)): 
* ~ or _ is used for _SubScript 
* ^ is for ^SuperScript
* Alternatively use <sub>sub</sub> and <sup>sup</sup> (brief enough, but cluttered in Math Formulas)
* Use __bad__ and **good** to indicate Sentiment  
* Math is expressed in [LaTeX](https://upyesp.org/posts/makrdown-vscode-math-notation/) or MathML  using MathJax between $ Signs: $\sqrt[3]{a}$  $a^3_2$ 
	* AsciiMath doesn't seem to work: `a^3` $`a^3`$ $a<=b$  

# Examples
* 

# Links
* Internal [ [WikiLinks]] are handled only by Obsidian or other Wiki Software and abstract from the Path 
* Alternatively, any CamelCase (used in TiddlyWiki and Ward Cunninghams Wiki) /relative/Path or Text_with_Underscore may be recognized as a nerdy WikiLink that has to be humanized and converted to a relative Path. 
* Other [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) Apps require proper [ markdown] (Links with relative or absolute Path) 
* 

# Media 
- Media can become large, so it exceeds free Cloud offerings 
	- either put it into a single xLarge Folder in an outer Vault and sync only the inner Vault
	- or create a Folder as soon as you have Attachments and ignore it in .gitIgnore 
		- could also use File Attributes for that 
	- adding a .nosync Extension (anywhere) to every File works, but is not practical! 
	- Limitations of Git Working Copy: 
		- no push commits 
		- less than 5 repositories.
