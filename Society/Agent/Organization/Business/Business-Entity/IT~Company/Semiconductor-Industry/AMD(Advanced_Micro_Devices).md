> AMD was founded in 1969 by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals. 
> The company's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. 
> In 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market, competing with Intel, its main rival in the industry. 
> In the early 2000s, it experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market 
> and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors. 
> However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, 
> as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.
>
> In the late 2010s, AMD regained market share due to the success of its Ryzen processors 
> which were considerably more competitive with Intel microprocessors 
> in terms of their performance in business applications, including cloud applications.
