Thomson was named after the electrical engineer [Elihu Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_Thomson "Elihu Thomson"), 
who was born in [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester "Manchester"), England, on 26 March 1853. 
Thomson moved to [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia"), USA, at the age of 5, with his family. 
Thomson formed the [[Thomson-Houston_Electric_Company]] in 1879 with [Edwin Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Houston "Edwin Houston"). 
The company merged with the [Edison General Electric Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_General_Electric_Company "Edison General Electric Company") to become [[GE(General_Electric)]]  in 1892. 

In 1893, the _Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston_ (CFTH) was formed in Paris, 
a sister company to GE in the United States. 
It was from this company that the modern Thomson Group would evolve.

[[Thomson_Semiconducteurs]] was created in 1982 
by the French government's widespread nationalization of industries 
following the [election of socialist François Mitterrand to the presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_French_presidential_election "1981 French presidential election").
