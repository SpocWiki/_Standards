# [[Business]]

#is_/same_as :: [[../../WikiData/WD~Business,4830453]] 

Business is performed by a [[Business/Business-Entity]], which can be of different [[../../schema-org/Class/is_a_/Intangible/enumeration/business_entity_type|business_entity_type]]s. 

Here Business is used in the narrow sense of a concrete Business Entity owned by a natural Person. 
Business is used broadly to describe [[Commerce]]. 

Colloquially, Business is anything that keeps you occupied / busy. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> **Business** is the practice of making one's living or making money 
> by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). 
> It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for [[Profit]]."
>
> A business entity is not necessarily separate from the owner 
> and the creditors can hold the owner liable for debts the business has acquired. 
> 
> The taxation system for businesses is different from that of the corporates. 
> A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. 
> The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
>
> A distinction is made in law and public offices 
> between the term business and a company such as a corporation or cooperative. 
> Colloquially, the terms are used interchangeably.
>
> Corporations are distinct from with sole proprietors and partnerships. 
> They are separate legal entities and provide limited liability for their owners and members. 
> They are subject to corporate tax rates. 
> They are also more complicated and expensive to set up, 
> but offer more protection and benefits for the owners and members.
