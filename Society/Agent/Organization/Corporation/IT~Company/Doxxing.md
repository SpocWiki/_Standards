> Historically, the term has been used to refer to both the aggregation of this information from public databases 
> and social media websites (like Facebook), 
> and the publication of previously private information obtained through criminal 
> or otherwise fraudulent means (such as hacking and social engineering).
>
> The aggregation and provision of previously published material is generally legal, 
> though it may be subject to laws concerning stalking and intimidation. 
> Doxing may be carried out for reasons such as online shaming, extortion, and vigilante aid to law enforcement.
