## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Solidarity** or solidarism is an awareness of shared interests, objectives, standards, and sympathies 
> creating a psychological sense of unity of groups or classes. 
> 
> True solidarity means moving beyond individual identities and single issue politics. 
> Still, solidarity does not reject individuals and sees individuals as the basis of society. 
> 
> It refers to the ties in a society that bind people together as one. 
> The term is generally employed in sociology and the other social sciences, as well as in philosophy and bioethics. 
> It is a significant concept in Catholic social teaching and in Christian democratic political ideology. 
> Although closely related to the concept of charity, solidarity aspires to change whole systems, not merely to help individuals.
>
> Solidarity is also one of six principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 
> and International Human Solidarity Day is recognized each year on December 20 as an international observance. 
> 
> Solidarity is not mentioned in the European Convention on Human Rights 
> nor in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
> and therefore has lesser legal meaning when compared to basic rights.
>
> Concepts of solidarity are mentioned in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, but not defined clearly.
