> **Hegemony** is the political, economic, and military predominance 
> of one state over other states, either regional or global.
>
> In Ancient Greece (ca. 8th BC – AD 6th c.), hegemony denoted 
> the politico-military dominance of the hegemon city-state over other city-states. 
> In the 19th century, hegemony denoted the "social or cultural predominance or ascendancy; predominance by one group within a society or milieu" and "a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society".
>
> In theories of imperialism, the hegemonic order dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government.
>
> The term hegemonism denoted the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over other countries, e.g., the hegemony of the Great Powers established with European colonialism in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
>
> In international relations theories, hegemony is distinguished from empire as ruling only external but not internal affairs of other states.
