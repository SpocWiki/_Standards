> The Arab Spring (Arabic: الربيع العربي, romanized: ar-rabīʻ al-ʻarabī) or 
> the First Arab Spring (to distinguish from the Second Arab Spring) 
> was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings and armed rebellions 
> that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. 
> 
> It began in Tunisia in response to corruption and economic stagnation. 
> From Tunisia, the protests then spread to five other countries: 
> Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain. 
> 
> Rulers were deposed: 
> - Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia in 2011, 
> - Muammar Gaddafi of Libya in 2011, 
> - Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in 2011, and 
> - Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen in 2012 
> or major uprisings and social violence occurred including riots, civil wars, or insurgencies. 
> 
> Sustained street demonstrations took place 
> in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan. 
> Minor protests took place in Djibouti, Mauritania, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and the Western Sahara. 
> 
> A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is ash-shaʻb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām! 
> (Arabic: الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام, lit. 'the people want to bring down the regime').
>
> The wave of initial revolutions and protests faded by mid to late 2012, 
> as many Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities, 
> pro-government militias, counterdemonstrators, and militaries. 
> 
> These attacks were answered with violence from protesters in some cases. 
> 
> Multiple large-scale conflicts followed: the Syrian civil war; the rise of ISIL, 
> insurgency in Iraq and the following civil war; 
> the Egyptian Crisis, election and removal from office of Mohamed Morsi, 
> and subsequent unrest and insurgency; 
> the Libyan Crisis; and the Yemeni crisis and subsequent civil war. 
> 
> Regimes that lacked major oil wealth and hereditary succession arrangements 
> were more likely to undergo regime change.
>
> A power struggle continued after the immediate response to the Arab Spring. 
> While leadership changed and regimes were held accountable, 
> power vacuums opened across the Arab world. 
> 
> Ultimately, it resulted in a contentious battle between 
> - a consolidation of power by religious elites and 
> - the growing support for democracy in many Muslim-majority states. 
> 
> The early hopes that these popular movements would end corruption, 
> increase political participation, and bring about greater economic equity 
> quickly collapsed in the wake of the counter-revolutionary moves by foreign state actors in Yemen, 
> the regional and international military interventions in Bahrain and Yemen, 
> and the destructive civil wars in Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen.
>
> Some have referred to the succeeding and still ongoing conflicts as the Arab Winter. 
> Recent uprisings in Sudan and Algeria show 
> that the conditions that started the Arab Spring have not faded 
> and political movements against authoritarianism and exploitation are still occurring. 
> 
> Since late 2018, multiple uprisings and protest movements in Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Lebanon, 
> and Egypt have been seen as a continuation of the Arab Spring.
>
> As of 2024, multiple conflicts are still continuing that might be seen as a result of the Arab Spring. 
> The Syrian Civil War has caused massive political instability and economic hardship in Syria, 
> with the Syrian pound plunging to new lows. 
> 
> In Libya, a major civil war concluded, with foreign powers intervening. 
> 
> In Yemen, a civil war continues to affect the country. 
> 
> In Lebanon, a major banking crisis is threatening the country's economy 
> as well as that of neighboring Syria. 
> 
> In December 2024, opposition groups in the Syrian Civil War 
> launched offensives against the Syrian government, resulting in Bashar Al-Assad being overthrown, 
> the Assad dynasty ending after over 50 years, the fall of Damascus, 
> and the 2024 Israeli invasion of Syria.
