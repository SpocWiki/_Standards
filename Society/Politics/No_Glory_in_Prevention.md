# [[No_Glory_in_Prevention]]


## Application 

The saying that there is [[No Glory in Prevention]] can be applied in any number of Situations: 
- [[../../../Life/Existential_Threat/Climate_Change|Climate_Change]] 
- [[../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/Military~Aggressor|Military~Aggressor]] 
- [[../../schema-org/Class/is_a_/Intangible/enumeration/government_benefits_type/health_care|HealthCare]] 
	- e.g. [[Vaccination]] 
- [[../../../IT/Programming/Refactoring|Refactoring]] 
- [[Reform]] vs [[../../../_protect/Society/Sociology/Revolution|Revolution]] 
- etc. 

## Counter-Argument 

The Cost of Prevention is often lower than the escalation of a bad situation. 

But conservative Forces either 
- oppose any change or 
- avoid the (lower) cost now
