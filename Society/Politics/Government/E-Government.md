## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **E-Government** (known for electronic government) involves utilizing technology devices, 
> such as computers and the Internet, for faster means of delivering public services to citizens 
> and other persons in a country or region. 
> 
> E-government offers new opportunities for more direct and convenient citizen access to government 
> and for government provision of services directly to citizens.
>
> E-government involves digital interactions across various levels and stakeholders (C2G), 
> between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), 
> between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). 
> 
> E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories: 
> This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in governance using information and communication technology (ICT) (such as computers and websites) and business process re-engineering (BPR). Brabham and Guth (2017) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies, which include progressive values, ubiquitous participation, geolocation, and education of the public.
>
> Other definitions stray from the idea that technology is an object and defines e-government simply as facilitators or instruments and focus on specific changes in Public Administration issues. The internal transformation of a government is the definition that established the specialist technologist Mauro D. Ríos. In his paper "In Search of a Definition of Electronic Government", he says: "Digital government is a new way of organization and management of public affairs, introducing positive transformational processes in management and the structure itself of the organization chart, adding value to the procedures and services provided, all through the introduction and continued appropriation of information and communication technologies as a facilitator of these transformations."
