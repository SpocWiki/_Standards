> A police state is a state whose government institutions 
> exercise an extreme level of control over civil society and liberties. 
> 
> There is typically little to no distinction between the law 
> and the exercise of political power by the executive, 
> and the deployment of internal security and police forces play a heightened role in governance. 
> 
> A police state is a characteristic of authoritarian, totalitarian or illiberal regimes 
> (contrary to a liberal democratic regime). 
> 
> Such governments are not exclusive to simply one-party states or dominant-party states, 
> as they can also arise in a democracy or multi-party system.

> Originally, a police state was a state regulated by a civil administration, but since the beginning of the 20th century it has "taken on an emotional and derogatory meaning" by describing an undesirable state of living characterized by the overbearing presence of civil authorities. The inhabitants of a police state may experience restrictions on their mobility, or on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement. Political control may be exerted by means of a secret police force that operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional state. Robert von Mohl, who first introduced the rule of law to German jurisprudence, contrasted the Rechtsstaat ("legal" or "constitutional" state) with the anti-aristocratic Polizeistaat ("police state").
