> In Marxist philosophy, the dictatorship of the proletariat is a condition 
> in which the proletariat, or the working class, holds control over state power. 
> 
> The dictatorship of the proletariat is the transitional phase 
> from a capitalist to a communist economy, 
> whereby the post-revolutionary state seizes the means of production, 
> mandates the implementation of direct elections 
> on behalf of and within the confines of the ruling proletarian state party, 
> and institutes elected delegates into representative workers' councils 
> that nationalise ownership of the means of production 
> from private to collective ownership.
>
> Other terms commonly used to describe the dictatorship of the proletariat include the socialist state, proletarian state, democratic proletarian state, revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat, and democratic dictatorship of the proletariat.
