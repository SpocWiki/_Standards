## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Tyrant** (from Ancient Greek  τύραννος (túrannos) 'absolute ruler'), 
> in the modern English usage of the word, is an absolute ruler who is unrestrained by law, 
> or one who has usurped a legitimate ruler's sovereignty. 
> 
> Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their positions by resorting to repressive means. 
> The original Greek term meant an absolute sovereign who came to power without constitutional right, 
> yet the word had a neutral connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. 
> 
> However, Greek philosopher Plato saw tyrannos as a negative form of government, 
> and on account of the decisive influence of philosophy on politics, 
> deemed tyranny the "fourth and worst disorder of a state."
>
> Tyrants lack "the very faculty that is the instrument of judgment"—reason. 
> The tyrannical man is enslaved because the best part of him (reason) is enslaved, 
> and likewise, the tyrannical state is enslaved, because it too lacks reason and order.
>
> The philosophers Plato and Aristotle defined a tyrant as a person who rules without law, 
> using extreme and cruel methods against both his own people and others. 
> 
> The Encyclopédie defined the term as a usurper of sovereign power who makes 
> "his subjects the victims of his passions and unjust desires, which he substitutes for laws".
>
> In the late fifth and fourth centuries BC, a new kind of tyrant, 
> one who had the support of the military, arose – specifically in Sicily.
>
> One can apply accusations of tyranny to a variety of types of government:
> - to government by one individual (in an autocracy)
> - to government by a minority (in an oligarchy, tyranny of the minority)
> - to government by a majority (in a democracy, tyranny of the majority)
