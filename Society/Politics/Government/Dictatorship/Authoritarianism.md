## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Authoritarianism** is a political system characterized by 
> - the rejection of political plurality, 
> - the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and 
> - reductions in democracy, separation of powers, civil liberties, and the rule of law. 
> 
> Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic 
> and may be based upon the rule of a party, the military, 
> or the concentration of power in a single person. 
> 
> States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism 
> have sometimes been characterized as "hybrid democracies", "hybrid regimes" 
> or "competitive authoritarian" states.
>
> The political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, 
> An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:
> - Limited political pluralism, which is achieved with 
>   constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.
> - Political legitimacy based on **appeals to emotion** and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency."
> - Minimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.
> - Ill-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting, 
>   used to extend the power of the executive.
>
> Minimally defined, an authoritarian government 
> lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, 
> free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. 
> 
> Broadly defined, authoritarian states include 
> countries that **lack human rights** such as freedom of religion, or 
> countries in which the government and the opposition **do not alternate in power** at least once following free elections. 
> 
> Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions 
> such as political parties, legislatures 
> and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule 
> and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections.
>
> Since 1946, the share of authoritarian states in the international political system 
> increased until the mid-1970s but declined from then until the year 2000. 
> 
> Prior to 2000, dictatorships typically began with a coup 
> and replaced a pre-existing authoritarian regime. 
> 
> Since 2000, dictatorships are most likely to begin through **democratic backsliding** 
> whereby a democratically elected leader established an authoritarian regime.
