> A **Dictator** is a political leader who possesses absolute power. 
> A dictatorship is a state ruled by one dictator or by a polity. 
> 
> The word originated as the title of a Roman dictator 
> elected by the Roman Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency. 
> Like the terms "tyrant" and "autocrat", 
> dictator came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive rule. 
> In modern usage, the term dictator is generally used 
> to describe a leader who holds or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power. 
>
> Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: 
> - suspension of elections and civil liberties; 
> - proclamation of a state of emergency; 
> - rule by decree; 
> - repression of political opponents; 
> - not abiding by the procedures of the rule of law; and the 
> - existence of a cult of personality centered on the leader. 
> 
> Dictatorships are often one-party or dominant-party states. 
> A wide variety of leaders coming to power in different kinds of regimes, such as 
> - one-party or dominant-party states and 
> - civilian governments under a personal rule, 
> have been described as dictators.
