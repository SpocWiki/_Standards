## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Totalitarianism** is a political system and a form of government 
> that prohibits opposition from political parties, 
> disregards and outlaws the political claims of individual and group opposition to the state, 
> and completely controls the public sphere and the private sphere of society. 
> 
> In the field of political science, totalitarianism is the extreme form of authoritarianism, 
> wherein all political power is held by a dictator. 
> 
> This figure controls the national politics and peoples of the nation 
> with continual propaganda campaigns that are 
> broadcast by state-controlled and state-aligned private mass communications media.
>
> The totalitarian government uses ideology to control most aspects of human life, 
> such as the political economy of the country, the system of education, 
> the arts, sciences, and private morality of its citizens. 
> 
> In the exercise of power, the difference between a totalitarian regime of government 
> and an authoritarian regime of government is one of degree; 
> whereas totalitarianism features a charismatic dictator and a fixed worldview, 
> authoritarianism only features a dictator who holds power for the sake of holding power. 
> The authoritarian dictator is supported, either jointly or individually, by a military junta 
> and by the socio-economic elites who are the ruling class of the country.
>
> The word totalitarian was first used in the early 1920s to describe the Italian Fascist regime. 
> The term totalitarianism gained wider usage in politics of the interwar period; 
> in the early years of the Cold War, it arose from comparison of 
> the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin 
> and Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler as a theoretical concept of Western political science, 
> achieving hegemony in explaining the nature of Fascist and Communist states, 
> and later entered the Western historiography of Communism, 
> the Soviet Union and the Russian Revolution; 
> 
> In the 21st century, it became applied to Islamist movements and their governments. 
> 
> The concept of totalitarianism has been challenged 
> and criticized by some historians of Nazi Germany and Stalinist USSR. 
> When defined as exemplary cases of totalitarianism, 
> on the grounds that the main characteristics of the concept – 
> total control over society, total mobilization of the masses, 
> and a monolithic centralized character of the regime – 
> were never achieved by the dictatorships called totalitarian. 
> 
> To support this claim, the historians argue that the political structures of these states 
> were disorganized and chaotic, and that 
> despite the supposed external similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, 
> their internal logic and structure were substantially different. 
> 
> The applicability of the concept to Islamism has also been criticized.
