## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Ombudsman** ( OM-buudz-mən, also US:  -⁠bədz-, -⁠budz-) is a government official 
> who investigates and tries to resolve complaints, 
> usually through recommendations (binding or not) or mediation. 
> 
> They are usually appointed by the government or by parliament 
> (often with a significant degree of independence).
>
> Ombudsmen also aim to identify systemic issues 
> leading to poor service or breaches of people's rights. 
> 
> At the national level, most ombudsmen have a wide mandate to deal with 
> the entire public sector, and sometimes also elements of the private sector 
> (for example, contracted service providers). 
> 
> In some cases, there is a more restricted mandate to a certain sector of society. 
> More recent developments have included the creation of specialized children's ombudsmen.
>
> In some countries, an inspector general, citizen advocate or other official 
> may have duties similar to those of a national ombudsman 
> and may also be appointed by a legislature. 
> 
> Below the national level, an ombudsman 
> may be appointed by a state, local, or municipal government. 
> 
> Private ombudsmen may be appointed by, or even work for, a corporation 
> such as a utility supplier, newspaper, NGO, or professional regulatory body.
>
> In some jurisdictions, 
> an ombudsman charged with handling concerns about national government 
> is more formally referred to as the "parliamentary commissioner" 
> (e.g. the United Kingdom Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, 
> and the Western Australian state Ombudsman). 
> 
> In many countries where the ombudsman's responsibility includes protecting human rights, the ombudsman is recognized as the national human rights institution. 
> 
> The post of ombudsman had by the end of the 20th century been instituted 
> by most governments and by some intergovernmental organizations 
> such as the European Union. 
> 
> As of 2005, including national and sub-national levels, 
> a total of 129 offices of ombudsman have been established around the world.
