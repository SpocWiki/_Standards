> A **Duchy**, also called a dukedom, is a country, territory, fief, or domain ruled by a duke or duchess, 
> a ruler hierarchically second to the king or queen in Western European tradition.
>
> There once existed an important difference between "sovereign dukes" 
> and dukes who were ordinary noblemen throughout Europe. 
> 
> Some historic duchies were sovereign in areas 
> that would become part of nation-states only during the modern era, 
> such as happened in Germany (once a federal empire) and Italy (previously a unified kingdom). 
> 
> In contrast, others were subordinate districts of those kingdoms 
> that had unified either partially or completely during the medieval era, 
> such as France, Spain, Sicily, Naples, and the Papal States.
