## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A one-party state, single-party state, one-party system or single-party system 
> is a governance structure in which only a single political party controls the ruling system. 
> 
> In a one-party state, all opposition parties are either outlawed 
> or have limited and controlled participation in elections. 
> 
> The term "de facto one-party " is sometimes used to describe a dominant-party system 
> that, unlike a one-party state, allows (at least nominally) multiparty elections, 
> but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning power.
>
> Membership in the ruling party tends to be relatively small compared to the population. 
> Rather, they give out private goods to fellow elites to ensure continued support. 
> 
> One-party, compared to dominant-party dictatorships, structure themselves unlike democracies. 
> They also turn into multi-party democracies at a lower rate than dominant-party dictatorships. 
> 
> While one-party states prohibit opposition parties, some allow for independent candidates 
> to stand for election in competition with party candidates. 
> 
> Therefore, they place elites and sympathetic candidates in key administrative races. 
> For example, the Chinese Communist Party exercises political control 
> by infiltrating village administrations. 
> They view these positions as crucial for gathering information on the population 
> and maintaining a presence in the far reaches of their borders.
>
> One-party states recognize the trade-off between election victory and gathering valuable data. 
> To account for this, the regimes have been observed placing local nobility in easy-to-win races. 
> 
> One-party states have also been observed using elections 
> to ensure that only the most popular elites get chosen to office. 
> 
> They also gather data from elections 
> to indicate if a local official is performing poorly in the eyes of the residents. 
> 
> This gives locals the opportunity to monitor local officials 
> and communicate satisfaction with the local government. 
> 
> Throughout the country, members of the one party hold key political positions. 
> In doing so, the party avoids committing outright fraud 
> and rather sustains their power at the local level with strategic appointment of elites. 
> 
> Data on one-party regimes can be difficult to gather given their lack of transparency.
