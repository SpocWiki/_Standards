## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In political science, **Despotism** (Greek: Δεσποτισμός, romanized: despotismós) 
> is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power.  
> Normally, that entity is an individual, the despot (as in an autocracy), 
> but societies which limit respect and power to specific groups have also been called despotic.
>
> Colloquially, the word despot applies pejoratively to those who use their power and authority arbitrarily to oppress their populace or subordinates. More specifically, the term often applies to a head of state or government. In this sense, it is similar to the pejorative connotations that are associated with the terms tyrant and dictator.
>
> Despot has also been a royal title assumed by various leaders historically.
