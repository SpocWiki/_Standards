## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A semi-presidential republic, or dual executive republic, 
> is a republic in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet, 
> with the latter two being responsible to the legislature of the state. 
> 
> It differs from a parliamentary republic in that 
> it has an executive president independent of the legislature; 
> and from the presidential system in that the cabinet, although named by the president, 
> is responsible to the legislature, 
> which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence.
>
> While the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and Finland (from 1919 to 2000) 
> exemplified early semi-presidential systems, 
> the term "semi-presidential" was first introduced in 1959, 
> in an article by the journalist Hubert Beuve-Méry, 
> and popularized by a 1978 work written by the political scientist Maurice Duverger. 
> Both men intended to describe the French Fifth Republic (established in 1958).
