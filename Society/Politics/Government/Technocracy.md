> A **Technocracy** is a model of governance wherein 
> decision-makers are chosen for office based on their technical expertise and background. 
> 
> A technocracy differs from a traditional democracy in that 
> individuals selected to a leadership role are chosen through a process 
> that emphasizes their relevant skills and proven performance, 
> as opposed to whether or not they fit the majority interests of a popular vote.
>
> This system is sometimes presented as explicitly contrasting with representative democracy, 
> the notion that elected representatives should be the primary decision-makers in government, despite the fact that technocracy does not imply eliminating elected representatives. In a technocracy, decision-makers rely on individuals and institutions possessing specialized knowledge and data-based evidence rather than advisors with political affiliations or loyalty.

> The term technocracy was initially used to signify the application of the scientific method to solving social problems. In its most extreme form, technocracy is an entire government running as a technical or engineering problem and is mostly hypothetical. In more practical use, technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy run by technologists. A government in which elected officials appoint experts and professionals to administer individual government functions, and recommend legislation, can be considered technocratic. Some uses of the word refer to a form of meritocracy, where the most suitable are placed in charge, ostensibly without the influence of special interest groups. Critics have suggested that a "technocratic divide" challenges more participatory models of democracy, describing these divides as "efficacy gaps that persist between governing bodies employing technocratic principles and members of the general public aiming to contribute to government decision making".
