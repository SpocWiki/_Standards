## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A cabinet in governing is a group of people with the constitutional or legal task 
> to rule a country or state, or advise a head of state, usually from the executive branch. 
> 
> Their members are known as ministers and  secretaries 
> and they are often appointed by either heads of state or government. 
> Cabinets are typically the body responsible for the day-to-day management of the government 
> and response to sudden events, whereas the legislative and judicial branches 
> work in a measured pace, in sessions according to lengthy procedures.
>
> The function of a cabinet varies: 
> - in some countries, it is a collegiate decision-making body with collective responsibility, 
> - while in others it may function either as a purely advisory body 
>   or an assisting institution to a decision-making head of state or head of government. 
>
> In some countries, particularly those that use a parliamentary system (e.g., the United Kingdom), 
> the cabinet collectively decides the government's direction, 
> especially in regard to legislation passed by the parliament. 
> 
> In countries with a presidential system, such as the United States, 
> the cabinet does not function as a collective legislative influence; 
> rather, their primary role is as an official advisory council to the head of government. 
> In this way, the president obtains opinions and advice relating to forthcoming decisions. 
>
> Legally, under both types of system, the Westminster variant of a parliamentary system 
> and the presidential system, the cabinet "advises" the head of state: 
> the difference is that, in a parliamentary system, the monarch, viceroy, or ceremonial president 
> will **almost always follow this advice**, 
> whereas, in a presidential system, a president 
> who is also head of government and political leader 
> may depart from the cabinet's advice if they do not agree with it. 
>
> In practice, in nearly all parliamentary democracies that do not follow the Westminster system, and in three countries that do (Japan, Ireland, and Israel), 
> very often the cabinet does not "advise" the head of state as they play only a ceremonial role. 
> Instead, it is usually the head of government (usually called "prime minister") 
> who holds all means of power in their hands (e.g. in Germany, Sweden, etc.) 
> and to whom the cabinet reports.
>
> In both presidential and parliamentary systems, 
> cabinet officials administer executive branches, government agencies, or departments. 
> Cabinets are also important originators for legislation. 
> Cabinets and ministers are usually in charge of the preparation of proposed legislation 
> in the ministries before it is passed to the parliament. 
> Thus, often the majority of new legislation actually originates from the cabinet and its ministries.
