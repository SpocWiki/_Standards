> Democratic socialism is a left-wing economic and political philosophy 
> that supports political democracy and some form of a socially owned economy, 
> with a particular emphasis on economic democracy, workplace democracy, 
> and workers' self-management within a market socialist, decentralised planned, 
> or democratic centrally planned socialist economy. 
> 
> Democratic socialists argue that capitalism is inherently 
> incompatible with the values of freedom, equality, and solidarity 
> and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society. 
> 
> Although most democratic socialists seek a gradual transition to socialism, 
> democratic socialism can support revolutionary or reformist politics to establish socialism. 
> 
> Democratic socialism was popularised by socialists 
> who opposed the backsliding towards a one-party state in the Soviet Union 
> and other countries during the 20th century.

> The history of democratic socialism can be traced back to 19th-century socialist thinkers across Europe and the Chartist movement in Britain, which somewhat differed in their goals but shared a common demand for democratic decision-making and public ownership of the means of production and viewed these as fundamental characteristics of the society they advocated for. From the late 19th to the early 20th century, democratic socialism was heavily influenced by the gradualist form of socialism promoted by the British Fabian Society and Eduard Bernstein's evolutionary socialism in Germany.

> The phrase "democratic socialism" has been used in multiple senses, including a broad sense that refers to all forms of socialism which reject autocracy. In the broad sense, democratic socialism includes all anti-capitalist stances in support of democracy including reformist socialism, revolutionary socialism, state socialism, and left-wing populism. In colloquial usage, democratic socialism may more narrowly refer to the anti-capitalist wing of social democracy (or reformist socialism), seeking to move beyond the welfare state toward social ownership.
