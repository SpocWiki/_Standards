## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A parliamentary republic is a republic 
> that operates under a parliamentary system of government 
> where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from 
> and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). 
> 
> There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. 
> Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, 
> with the head of government holding real power 
> and the head of state being a ceremonial position, similar to constitutional monarchies. 
> 
> In some countries the head of state has reserve powers to use at their discretion 
> as a non-partisan "referee" of the political process. 
> 
> Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, 
> much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary confidence. 
> In general, parliamentary republics grant the  highest sovereign powers to the parliament.
