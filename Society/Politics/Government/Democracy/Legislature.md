## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Legislature** is a deliberative assembly with the legal authority 
> to make laws for a political entity such as a country, nation, or city 
> on behalf of the people therein. 
> 
> They are often contrasted with the executive and judicial bodies of government. 
> Legislatures can exist at different levels of government, 
> including national, state/provincial/regional, local, 
> and even supranational (such as the European Parliament). 
> 
> Countries differ as to what extent they grant deliberative assemblies 
> at the subnational level law-making power, 
> as opposed to purely administrative responsibilities.
>
> Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation. 
> In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, 
> with authority to amend the budget involved.
>
> The members of a legislature are called legislators. 
> In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, 
> although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, 
> particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper house.
