> A presidential, strong-president, or single-executive system 
> (sometimes also congressional system) is a form of government 
> in which a head of government (usually titled "president") heads an executive branch 
> that derives its authority and legitimacy from a source 
> that is **separate from the legislative branch**. 
> 
> The system was popularized by its inclusion in the Constitution of the United States.
>
> This head of government is often also the head of state. 
> In a presidential system, 
> the head of government is directly or indirectly elected by a group of citizens 
> and is not responsible to the legislature, 
> and the legislature cannot dismiss the president except in extraordinary cases. 
> 
> A presidential system contrasts with a parliamentary system, 
> where the head of government (usually called a prime minister) 
> derives their power from the confidence of an elected legislature, 
> which can dismiss the prime minister with a simple majority.
>
> Not all presidential systems use the title of president. 
> Likewise, the title is sometimes used by other systems. 
> It originated from a time when such a person personally presided over the governing body, 
> as with the President of the Continental Congress in the early United States, 
> before the executive function being split into a separate branch of government. 
> 
> Presidents may also use it in semi-presidential systems. 
> Heads of state of parliamentary republics, largely ceremonial in most cases, are called presidents. 
> Dictators or leaders of one-party states, whether popularly elected or not, are also often called presidents.
>
> The presidential system is the most common form of government in the Americas 
> and is also frequently found in Sub-Saharan Africa (along with semi-presidential hybrid systems). 
> 
> By contrast, there are very few presidential republics in Europe 
> (with Cyprus and Turkey being the only examples). 
> In Asia, the system is used by South Korea, Syria, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
