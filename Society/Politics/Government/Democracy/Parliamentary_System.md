## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A parliamentary system, or parliamentary democracy, 
> is a form of government where the head of government (chief executive) 
> derives their democratic legitimacy from their ability to command the support ("confidence") 
> of a majority of the legislature, to which they are held accountable. 
> 
> This head of government is usually, but not always, distinct from a ceremonial head of state. 
> This is in contrast to a presidential system, which features a president 
> who is not fully accountable to the legislature, 
> and cannot be replaced by a simple majority vote.
>
> Countries with parliamentary systems may be constitutional monarchies, 
> where a monarch is the head of state 
> while the head of government is almost always a member of parliament, 
> 
> or parliamentary republics, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state 
> while the head of government is from the legislature. 
> 
> In a few countries, the head of government is also head of state 
> but is elected by the legislature. 
> 
> In bicameral parliaments, 
> the head of government is generally, though not always, a member of the lower house.
>
> Parliamentary democracy is the predominant form of government in the European Union, 
> Oceania, and throughout the former British Empire, 
> with other users scattered throughout Africa and Asia. 
> 
> A similar system, called a council–manager government, 
> is used by many local governments in the United States.
