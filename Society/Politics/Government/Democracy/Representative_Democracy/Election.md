## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **election** is a formal group decision-making process 
> whereby a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
>
> Elections have been the usual mechanism 
> by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century. 
> Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, 
> and for  regional and local government, such as cities or towns. 
> 
> This process is also used in many other Standardized Associations, public businesses, 
> and organizations , from clubs to voluntary association and corporations.
>
> The global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives 
> in modern representative democracies is in contrast with 
> the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, 
> where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution 
> and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as "Sortition", 
> by which office holders were chosen by lot.
>
> Electoral reform describes the process of 
> introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, 
> or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. 
> 
> Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections 
> (especially with a view to predicting future results). 
> Election is the fact of electing, or being elected.
>
> To elect means "to select or to Nominate", and so 
> sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, 
> especially in the United States.
