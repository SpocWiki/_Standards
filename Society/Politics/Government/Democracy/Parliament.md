> In modern politics and history, a **Parliament** is a legislative body of government. 
> Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: 
> - representing the electorate, 
> - making laws, and 
> - overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. 
> 
> The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress 
> and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies. 
> Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, 
> although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems 
> (e.g., the Parliament of Ghana), even where it is not in the official name.
>
> Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, 
> and judicial assemblies. 
> 
> What is considered to be the first modern parliament, was the Cortes of León, 
> held in the Kingdom of León in 1188. According to the UNESCO, the Decreta of Leon of 1188 is the oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system. In addition, UNESCO granted the 1188 Cortes of Alfonso IX the title of "Memory of the World" and the city of Leon has been recognized as the "Cradle of Parliamentarism".
