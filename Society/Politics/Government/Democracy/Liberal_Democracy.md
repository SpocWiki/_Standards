> Liberal democracy, also called Western-style democracy, or substantive democracy, 
> is a form of government that combines the organization of a democracy 
> with ideas of liberal political philosophy. 
> 
> Common elements within a liberal democracy are: 
> - elections between or among multiple distinct political parties; 
> - a separation of powers into different branches of government; 
> - the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society; 
> - a market economy with private property; 
> - universal suffrage; and 
> - the equal protection of 
> 	- human rights, 
> 	- civil rights, 
> 	- civil liberties, and 
> - political freedoms for all citizens. 
> 
> Substantive democracy refers to substantive rights and substantive laws, 
> which can include substantive equality, the equality of outcome for subgroups in society. 
> Liberal democracy emphasizes the separation of powers, an independent judiciary, 
> and a system of checks and balances between branches of government. 
> Multi-party systems with at least two persistent, viable political parties 
> are characteristic of liberal democracies.
>
> Governmental authority is legitimately exercised 
> only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed laws 
> adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedure. 
> 
> To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a constitution, 
> either codified or uncodified, to delineate the powers of government 
> and enshrine the social contract. 
> 
> A liberal democracy may take various and mixed constitutional forms: 
> it may be a constitutional monarchy or a republic. 
> 
> It may have a parliamentary system, presidential system, or semi-presidential system. 
> 
> Liberal democracies are contrasted with illiberal democracies and dictatorships. 
> Some liberal democracies, especially those with large populations, 
> use federalism (also known as vertical separation of powers) in order to prevent abuse 
> and increase public input by dividing governing powers between municipal, provincial and national governments. 
> 
> The characteristics of liberal democracies are correlated with increased political stability, 
> lower corruption, better management of resources, 
> and better health indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality.
>
> Liberal democracy traces its origins—and its name—to the Age of Enlightenment. 
> The conventional views supporting monarchies and aristocracies were challenged 
> at first by a relatively small group of Enlightenment intellectuals, 
> who believed that human affairs should be guided by reason 
> and principles of liberty and equality. 
> 
> They argued that all people are created equal, that governments exist to serve the people
> —not vice versa—and that laws should apply to those who govern 
> as well as to the governed (a concept known as rule of law), 
> formulated in Europe as Rechtsstaat. 
> 
> In England, thinkers such as John Locke (1632–1704) argued 
> that all people are created equal, that governments exist to serve the governed, 
> and that laws must apply equally to rulers and citizens alike 
> (a concept later expressed as the rule of law). 
> 
> At the same time, on the European continent, 
> French philosophers developed equally influential theories: Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws (1748) advanced the doctrine of separation of powers, Rousseau's The Social Contract (1762) articulated the principle of popular sovereignty and the "general will", and Voltaire championed freedom of conscience and expression. 
> 
> These ideas were central to the French Revolution 
> and spread widely across Europe and beyond. 
> 
> They also influenced the American Revolution and the broader development of liberal democracy. 
> 
> After a period of expansion in the second half of the 20th century, 
> liberal democracy became a prevalent political system in the world.
