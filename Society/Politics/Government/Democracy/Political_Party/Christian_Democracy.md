## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Christian democracy is an ideology inspired by Christian social teaching 
> to respond to the challenges of contemporary society and politics.
>
> Christian democracy has drawn mainly from Catholic social teaching and neo-scholasticism, 
> as well as the Neo-Calvinist tradition within Christianity; 
> it later gained ground with Lutherans and Pentecostals, 
> among other denominational traditions of Christianity in various parts of the world. 
> 
> During the nineteenth century, its principal concerns were to reconcile Catholicism with democracy, 
> to answer the "social question" surrounding capitalism and the working class, 
> and to resolve the tensions between church and state. 
> 
> In the twentieth century, Christian democrats led postwar Western and Southern Europe 
> in building modern welfare states and constructing the European Union. 
> Furthermore; in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, 
> Christian democracy has gained support in Eastern Europe 
> among former communist states suffering from corruption and stagnation.
>
> On the European left-right political spectrum, Christian democracy has been difficult to pinpoint, 
> as Christian democrats have often rejected liberal economics and individualism 
> and advocated state intervention, 
> while simultaneously defending private property rights against excessive state intervention. 
> 
> This has meant that Christian democracy has historically been considered centre-left on economics 
> and centre-right on many social and moral issues. 
> More recently, Christian democrats have positioned themselves as the centre-right; 
> as with both the European People's Party and European Christian Political Party, 
> with which many Christian democratic parties in Europe are affiliated. 
> Christian democrats support a "slightly regulated market economy", 
> featuring an effective social security system, thus a social market economy.
>
> Worldwide, many Christian democratic parties are members of the Centrist Democrat International. 
> Examples of major Christian democratic parties include 
> - the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, 
> - the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal, 
> - The Centre in Switzerland, 
> - the Spanish People's Party, 
> - the Mexican National Action Party, 
> - the Austrian People's Party, and 
> - the Christian Democratic Party of Chile. 
> Many Christian democratic parties in the Americas 
> are affiliated with the Christian Democrat Organization of America.
>
> Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, 
> although it is also present in other parts of the world.
