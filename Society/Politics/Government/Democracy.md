## Types of Democracies

Each characteristic is given a binary distinction, representing possible alternatives:

| Type of Democracy        | Direct vs. Representative | Parliamentary vs. Presidential |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Direct Democracy         | Direct                    | N/A                            |
| Representative Democracy | Representative            | *                              |
| Parliamentary Democracy  | Representative            | Parliamentary                  |
| Presidential Democracy   | Representative            | Presidential                   |

### Binary Democracy Criteria 

#### Direct vs. Representative 
- Direct democracy involves citizens voting on all major decisions, whereas 
- representative democracy involves electing officials to make decisions on their behalf.

#### Parliamentary vs. Presidential 
- In parliamentary systems, the executive branch derives its legitimacy from the legislature (parliament) 
  and is accountable to it. 
- Presidential systems have a separately elected president.

#### Federal vs. Unitary 
- Federal democracies have multiple levels of government 
  with shared sovereignty (e.g., states and central government), whereas 
- unitary systems have a single, centralized government.

#### Plurality vs. Proportional Representation 

- Plurality systems (such as first-past-the-post) elect winners who receive the most votes, 
  often in single-member districts. 
- Proportional representation allocates seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives, 
  aiming to reflect the electorate's overall distribution in the legislature.

#### Secular vs. Religious 
- Secular democracies maintain a separation between religion and state affairs [[Laizism]] , while 
- religious democracies incorporate religious principles into governance.

> **Democracy** (from Ancient Greek: δημοκρατία, romanized: dēmokratía, dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule') 
> is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state. 
> 
> Under a minimalist definition of democracy, rulers are elected through competitive elections 
> while more expansive definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights 
> in addition to competitive elections.
>
> In a direct democracy, the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation. In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. Who is considered part of "the people" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries. Features of democracy oftentimes include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.
>
> The notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. Most democracies apply in most cases majority rule, but in some cases plurality rule, supermajority rule (e.g. constitution) or consensus rule (e.g. Switzerland) are applied. They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues—counterbalancing majoritarianism—and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority—usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.
>
> The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean "rule of the people", in contrast to aristocracy (ἀριστοκρατία, aristokratía), meaning "rule of an elite". Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in antiquity, is generally considered to have originated in city-states such as those in Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.
>
> Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. World public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022.
