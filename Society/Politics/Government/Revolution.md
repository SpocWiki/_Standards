## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In political science, a **Revolution** (Latin: revolutio, 'a turn around') 
> is a rapid, fundamental transformation of a society's class, state, ethnic or religious structures. 
> 
> According to sociologist Jack Goldstone, 
> all revolutions contain "a common set of elements at their core: 
> (a) efforts to change the political regime that draw on a competing vision (or visions) of a just order, 
> (b) a notable degree of informal or formal mass mobilization, and 
> (c) efforts to force change through noninstitutionalized actions such as mass demonstrations, protests, strikes, or violence."
>
> Revolutions have occurred throughout human history 
> and varied in their methods, durations and outcomes. 
> 
> Some revolutions started with peasant uprisings 
> or guerrilla warfare on the periphery of a country; 
> others started with urban insurrection aimed at seizing the country's capital city. 
> 
> Revolutions can be inspired by the rising popularity of certain 
> political ideologies, moral principles, or models of governance such as nationalism, republicanism, egalitarianism, self-determination, human rights, democracy, liberalism, fascism, or socialism. 
> 
> A regime may become vulnerable to revolution due to a recent military defeat, 
> or economic chaos, or an affront to national pride and identity, 
> or persistent  repression and corruption. 
> 
> Revolutions typically trigger counter-revolutions 
> which seek to halt revolutionary momentum, 
> or to reverse the course of an ongoing revolutionary transformation.
>
> Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the 
> - American Revolution (1765–1783), 
> - French Revolution (1789–1799), 
> - Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), 
> - Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826), 
> - Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), 
> - Xinhai Revolution in China in 1911, 
> - Revolutions of 1917–1923 in Europe (including the Russian Revolution and German Revolution), 
> - Chinese Communist Revolution (1927–1949), 
> - decolonization of Africa (mid-1950s to 1975), 
> - Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), 
> - Cuban Revolution in 1959, 
> - Iranian Revolution and 
> - Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979, 
> - worldwide Revolutions of 1989, and Arab Spring in the early 2010s.
