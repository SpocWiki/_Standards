> Francisco "Pancho" Villa (PAN-choh VEE-ə, Spanish: [ˈpantʃo ˈβiʎa]; 
> born José Doroteo Arango Arámbula; 5 June 1878 – 20 July 1923) 
> was a Mexican revolutionary, guerrella leader and politician. 
> 
> He was a key figure in the Mexican Revolution, 
> which forced out President and dictator Porfirio Díaz 
> and brought Francisco I. Madero to power in 1911. 
> 
> When Madero was ousted by a coup led by General Victoriano Huerta in February 1913, 
> Villa joined the anti-Huerta forces in the Constitutionalist Army led by Venustiano Carranza. 
> 
> After the defeat and exile of Huerta in July 1914, Villa broke with Carranza. 
> Villa dominated the meeting of revolutionary generals that excluded Carranza 
> and helped create a coalition government. 
> 
> [[Zapata,Emiliano]] and Villa became formal allies in this period. 
> Like Zapata, Villa was strongly in favor of land reform, 
> but did not implement it when he had power. 
> 
> Villa served as provisional governor of Chihuahua from 1913 to 1914. 
> 
> At the height of his power and popularity in late 1914 and early 1915, 
> the U.S. considered recognizing Villa as Mexico's legitimate president. 
> 
> In Mexico, Villa is generally regarded as a hero of the Mexican Revolution 
> who dared to stand up to the United States. 
> Some American media outlets describe Villa as a villain and a murderer.
>
> In November 1915, civil war broke out when Carranza challenged Villa. 
> Villa was decisively defeated by Constitutionalist general Álvaro Obregón in summer 1915, 
> and the U.S. aided Carranza directly against Villa in the Second Battle of Agua Prieta. 
> 
> Much of Villa's army left after his defeat on the battlefield 
> and because of his lack of resources to buy arms and pay soldiers' salaries. 
> 
> Angered at U.S. support for Carranza, Villa conducted a raid on the border town of Columbus, New Mexico, to goad the U.S. into invading Mexico in 1916. 
> 
> Despite a major contingent of soldiers and superior military technology, the U.S. failed to capture Villa. When Carranza was ousted from power in 1920, Villa negotiated an amnesty with interim president Adolfo de la Huerta and was given a landed estate, on the condition he retire from politics. Villa was assassinated in 1923. Although his faction did not prevail in the Revolution, he was one of its most charismatic and prominent figures.
>
> In life, Villa helped fashion his own image as an internationally known revolutionary hero, starring as himself in Hollywood films and giving interviews to foreign journalists, most notably John Reed. After his death he was excluded from the pantheon of revolutionary heroes until the Sonoran generals Obregón and Calles, whom he battled during the Revolution, were gone from the political stage. Villa's exclusion from the official narrative of the Revolution might have contributed to his continued posthumous popular acclaim. He was celebrated during the Revolution and long afterward by corridos, films about his life and novels by prominent writers. In 1976, his remains were reburied in the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City in a huge public ceremony.
