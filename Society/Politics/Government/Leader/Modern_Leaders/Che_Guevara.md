## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Ernesto "Che" Guevara (14 June 1928 – 9 October 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, 
> physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. 
> A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, 
> his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion 
> and global insignia in popular culture.
>
> As a young medical student, Guevara travelled throughout South America 
> and was appalled by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed. 
> His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as 
> the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States 
> prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, 
> whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the [[United Fruit Company]] 
> solidified Guevara's political ideology. 
> 
> Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, 
> and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma 
> with the intention of overthrowing US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. 
> Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, 
> and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.
>
> After the Cuban Revolution, Guevara played key roles in the new government. 
> These included reviewing the appeals and death sentences 
> for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, 
> instituting agrarian land reform as minister of industries, 
> helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, 
> serving as both president of the National Bank and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, 
> and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. 
> 
> Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces 
> who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and bringing Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba, 
> which preceded the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. 
> 
> Additionally, Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla warfare manual, 
> along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle journey. 
> His experiences and studying of Marxism–Leninism led him to posit 
> that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result of imperialism, 
> neocolonialism, and monopoly capitalism, 
> with the only remedies being proletarian internationalism and world revolution. 
> 
> Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment continental revolutions across both Africa and South America, 
> first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, 
> where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.
>
> Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, 
> polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, 
> memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. 
> 
> As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for class struggle, 
> and desire to create the consciousness of a "new man" driven by moral rather than material incentives, 
> Guevara has evolved into a quintessential icon of various leftist movements. 
> 
> In contrast, his critics on the political right accuse him of promoting authoritarianism 
> and endorsing violence against his political opponents. 
> Despite disagreements on his legacy, 
> Time named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, 
> while an Alberto Korda photograph of him, titled Guerrillero Heroico, 
> was cited by the Maryland Institute College of Art as "the most famous photograph in the world".
