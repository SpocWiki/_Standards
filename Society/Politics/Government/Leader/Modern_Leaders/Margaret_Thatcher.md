> Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness (née Roberts; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013), 
> was a British stateswoman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
> from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. 
> 
> She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century 
> and the first woman to hold the position. 
> 
> As prime minister, she implemented policies that came to be known as Thatcherism. 
> A Soviet journalist dubbed her the "Iron Lady", 
> a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.
>
> Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and 
> worked briefly as a research chemist before becoming a barrister. 
> 
> She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. 
> Edward Heath appointed her secretary of state for education and science 
> in his 1970–1974 government. 
> 
> In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election 
> to become leader of the opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the UK.
>
> On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, 
> Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high inflation 
> and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession. 
> 
> Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised greater individual liberty, 
> the privatisation of state-owned companies, 
> and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. 
> 
> Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid the recession and rising unemployment. 
> 
> Victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy 
> brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. 
> 
> She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA 
> in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing 
> and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers 
> in the 1984–85 miners' strike. 
> 
> In 1986, Thatcher oversaw the deregulation of UK financial markets, 
> leading to an economic boom, in what came to be known as the Big Bang.
>
> Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, 
> but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (also known as the "poll tax") 
> was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views 
> on the European Community were not shared by others in her cabinet. 
> 
> She resigned as prime minister and party leader in 1990, 
> after a challenge was launched to her leadership, and was succeeded by John Major, 
> her chancellor of the Exchequer. 
> 
> After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage 
> as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) 
> which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. 
> In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87.
>
> A polarising figure in British politics, 
> Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings 
> and public opinion of British prime ministers. 
> 
> Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in Britain; 
> the complex legacy attributed to this shift continues to be debated into the 21st century.
