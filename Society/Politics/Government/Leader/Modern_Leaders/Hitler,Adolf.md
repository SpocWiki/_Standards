> **Adolf Hitler** (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician 
> who was the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. 
> 
> He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 
> and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. 
> 
> During his dictatorship, he initiated the European theatre of World War II 
> by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. 
> 
> He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war 
> and was central to the perpetration of the [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Holocaust]]: 
> the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.
>
> Hitler was born in [[Braunau am Inn]] in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. 
> He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913. 
> He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. 
> In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, 
> and in 1921 was appointed leader of the Nazi Party. 
>
> In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich 
> and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year of his sentence. 
>
> While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography 
> and political manifesto [[Mein Kampf]] ("My Struggle"). 
> After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support 
> by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, 
> antisemitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. 
> He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy.
>
> By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag 
> but did not have a majority. 
> No political parties were able to form a majority coalition 
> in support of a candidate for chancellor. 
> Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders 
> convinced President Paul von Hindenburg 
> to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. 
> Shortly thereafter, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 
> which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, 
> a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. 
> 
> Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler succeeded him, 
> becoming simultaneously the head of state and government with absolute power. 
> Domestically, Hitler implemented numerous racist policies 
> and sought to deport or kill German Jews. 
> His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, 
> the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, 
> and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, 
> which initially gave him significant popular support.
>
> One of Hitler's key goals was Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people 
> in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive, expansionist foreign policy 
> is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. 
> He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, 
> resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. 
> In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. 
> In December 1941, he declared war on the United States. 
> By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers 
> occupied most of Europe and North Africa. 
> These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, 
> and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. 
> On 29 April 1945, he married his long-term partner, Eva Braun, 
> in the Führerbunker in Berlin. 
> On the following day, the couple committed suicide 
> to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. 
> In accordance with Hitler's wishes, their corpses were burned.
>
> The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes Hitler as 
> "the embodiment of modern political evil". 
> Under Hitler's leadership and racist ideology, 
> the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of an estimated six million Jews 
> and millions of other victims, 
> whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. 
> Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for 
> the deliberate killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. 
> In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died 
> as a result of military action in the European theatre. 
> The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, 
> and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.
