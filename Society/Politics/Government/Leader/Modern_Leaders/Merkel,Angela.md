> Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU in 2018 
> and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election. 
> Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, her legacy came under increased scrutiny 
> both in Germany and abroad for her relatively warm relations with Russia 
> and increasing the German economy's dependence on Russia, 
> as well as the downsizing of the Bundeswehr that occurred during her tenure.
