> and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). 
> 
> She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, 
> and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany. 
> In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, 
> and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), 
> an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition. 
> 
> In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory 
> and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, 
> after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. 
> In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, 
> resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.
>
> In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, 
> both in the context of the EU and NATO, and initiating the Russian reset 
> and strengthening of Eurasian and transatlantic economic relations. 
> 
> In the first half of 2007, Merkel served as president of the European Council 
> and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. 
> 
> Merkel's governments managed the 2008 financial crisis and the Euro area crisis.

> and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. 
> 
> Also in 2008, she actively blocked the access of Ukraine and Georgia 
> in the enlargement of NATO during the 2008 Bucharest summit.
>

> renewable energy, Russian gas and the phaseout of nuclear power in Germany. 
> Despite the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, which prompted sanctions around the world, 
> she initiated the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipelines to Russia 
> and protected their construction from United States sanctions imposed in 2019. 
> 
> Reforms to the Bundeswehr, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, 
> and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship. 
> 
> Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU in 2018 
> and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election. 
> Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, her legacy came under increased scrutiny 
> both in Germany and abroad for her relatively warm relations with Russia 
> and increasing the German economy's dependence on Russia, 
> as well as the downsizing of the Bundeswehr that occurred during her tenure.
