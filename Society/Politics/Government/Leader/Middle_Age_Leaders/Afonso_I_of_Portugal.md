> nicknamed "the Conqueror" (Portuguese: O Conquistador) and "the Founder" (O Fundador) 
> by the Portuguese, was the first king of Portugal, from 26 July 1139 
> until his death on 6 December 1185.

> an objective that he pursued until his death.
>
> Afonso was the son of Theresa of León and Henry of Burgundy, rulers of the County of Portugal. 
> Henry died in 1112, leaving Theresa to rule alone. 
> Unhappy with Theresa's romantic relationship with Galician Fernando Pérez de Traba 
> and his political influence, the Portuguese nobility rallied around Afonso, 
> who revolted and defeated his mother at the Battle of São Mamede in 1128 
> and became sole Count of Portugal soon afterwards. 
> In 1139, Afonso renounced the suzerainty of the Kingdom of León 
> and established the independent Kingdom of Portugal.
>
> Afonso actively campaigned against the Moors in the south. 
> In 1139 he won a decisive victory at the Battle of Ourique, 
> and in 1147 he seized Santarém and Lisbon from the Moors, 
> with help from men on their way to the Holy Land for the Second Crusade. 
> 
> He secured the independence of Portugal following a victory over León at Valdevez 
> and received papal approval through Manifestis Probatum. 
> Afonso died in 1185 and was succeeded by his son, Sancho I.
