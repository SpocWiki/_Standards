## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A head of state is the public persona of a sovereign state. 
> The name given to the office of head of state depends on the country's form of government 
> and any separation of powers; the powers of the office in each country 
> range from being also the head of government 
> to being little more than a ceremonial figurehead.
>
> In a parliamentary system, such as India or the United Kingdom, 
> the head of state usually has mostly ceremonial powers, with a separate head of government. 
> 
> However, in some parliamentary systems, like South Africa, 
> there is an executive president that is both head of state and head of government. 
> Likewise, in some parliamentary systems the head of state 
> is not the head of government, but still has significant powers, for example Morocco. 
> In contrast, a semi-presidential system, such as France, 
> has both heads of state and government as the de facto leaders of the nation 
> (in practice, they divide the leadership of the nation between themselves).
>
> Meanwhile, in presidential systems, the head of state is also the head of government. 
> In one-party ruling communist states, the position of president has no tangible powers by itself; 
> however, since such a head of state, as a matter of custom, 
> simultaneously holds the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party, 
> they are the executive leader with their powers deriving from their status of being 
> the party leader, rather than the office of president.
>
> Former French president Charles de Gaulle, while developing the current Constitution of France 
> (1958), said that the head of state should embody l'esprit de la nation ("the spirit of the nation").
