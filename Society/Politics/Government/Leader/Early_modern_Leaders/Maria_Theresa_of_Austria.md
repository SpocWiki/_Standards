> Maria Theresia Walburga Amalia Christina; 13 May 1717 – 29 November 1780 
> was the ruler of the Habsburg monarchy from 1740 until her death in 1780, 
> and the only woman to hold the position in her own right. 
> 
> She was the sovereign of Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Slavonia, 
> Mantua, Milan, Moravia, Galicia and Lodomeria, Dalmatia, Austrian Netherlands, 
> Carinthia, Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Austrian Silesia, Tyrol, Styria and Parma. 
> By marriage, she was Duchess of Lorraine, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, and Holy Roman Empress.
>
> Maria Theresa started her 40-year reign when her father, Charles VI, 
> Holy Roman Emperor, died on 20 October 1740. 
> 
> Charles VI paved the way for her accession with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 
> and spent his entire reign securing it through international diplomacy. 
> He neglected the advice of Prince Eugene of Savoy, 
> who believed that a strong military and a rich treasury were more important than mere signatures. 
> 
> Eventually, Charles VI left behind a weakened and impoverished state, 
> particularly due to the War of the Polish Succession and the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739). 
> 
> Moreover, upon his death, Saxony, Prussia, Bavaria, and France 
> all repudiated the sanction they had recognised during his lifetime. 
> 
> Frederick II of Prussia (who became Maria Theresa's greatest rival for most of her reign) 
> promptly invaded and took the affluent Habsburg province of Silesia 
> in the eight-year conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession. 
> 
> In defiance of the grave situation, 
> she managed to secure the vital support of the Hungarians for the war effort. 
> During the course of the war, Maria Theresa successfully defended her rule 
> over most of the Habsburg monarchy, apart from the loss of Silesia 
> and a few minor territories in Italy. 
> Maria Theresa later unsuccessfully tried to recover Silesia during the Seven Years' War.
>
> Although she was expected to cede power to her husband, Emperor Francis I, 
> and her eldest son, Emperor Joseph II, 
> who were officially her co-rulers in Austria and Bohemia, 
> Maria Theresa ruled as an autocratic sovereign with the counsel of her advisers. 
> 
> She promulgated institutional, financial, medical, and educational reforms, 
> with the assistance of Wenzel Anton of Kaunitz-Rietberg, 
> Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, and Gerard van Swieten. 
> 
> She also promoted commerce and the development of agriculture, 
> and reorganised Austria's ramshackle military, 
> all of which strengthened Austria's international standing. 
> 
> A pious Catholic, she despised Freemasons, Jews and Protestants, 
> and on certain occasions she ordered their expulsion to remote parts of the realm. 
> She also advocated for the Catholic Church.
