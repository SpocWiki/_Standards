## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Qin Shi Huang** (Chinese: 秦始皇, ; February 259 – 12 July 210 BC) 
> was the founder of the Qin dynasty and the first emperor of China. 
> Rather than maintain the title of "king" (wáng 王) borne by the previous Shang and Zhou rulers, 
> he assumed the invented title of "emperor" (huángdì 皇帝), 
> which would see continuous use by monarchs in China for the next two millennia. 
>
> Born in Handan, the capital of Zhao, as Ying Zheng (嬴政) or Zhao Zheng (趙政), 
> his parents were King Zhuangxiang of Qin and Lady Zhao. 
> The wealthy merchant Lü Buwei assisted him in succeeding his father as the king of Qin, 
> after which he became King Zheng of Qin (秦王政). 
> 
> By 221 BC, he had conquered all the other warring states and unified all of China, 
> and he ascended the throne as China's first emperor. 
> During his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: 
> campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Sinosphere, 
> and campaigns in Inner Asia conquered the Ordos Plateau from the nomadic Xiongnu, 
> although the Xiongnu later rallied under Modu Chanyu.
>
> Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices among earlier Chinese states. He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars. His public works projects included the incorporation of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system, as well as his city-sized mausoleum guarded by a life-sized Terracotta Army. He ruled until his death in 210 BC, during his fifth tour of eastern China.
>
> Qin Shi Huang has often been portrayed as a tyrant and strict Legalist—characterizations that stem partly from the scathing assessments made during the Han dynasty that succeeded the Qin. Since the mid-20th century, scholars have begun questioning this evaluation, inciting considerable discussion on the actual nature of his policies and reforms. According to the sinologist Michael Loewe "few would contest the view that the achievements of his reign have exercised a paramount influence on the whole of China's subsequent history, marking the start of an epoch that closed in 1911".
