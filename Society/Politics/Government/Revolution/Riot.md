> A **Riot** or mob violence is a form of civil disorder 
> commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance 
> against authority, property, or people.
>
> Riots typically involve destruction of property, public or private. 
> The property targeted varies depending on the riot 
> and the inclinations of those involved. 
> Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, 
> and religious buildings.
>
> Riots often occur in reaction to a grievance or out of dissent. 
> Historically, riots have occurred due to poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions, governmental oppression, taxation or conscription, conflicts between ethnic groups (race riot) or religions (e.g., sectarian violence, pogrom), the outcome of a sporting event (e.g., sports riot, football hooliganism) or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances.
>
> While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots typically consist of disorganized groups that are frequently "chaotic and exhibit herd behavior". There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that riots are not irrational, herd-like behavior (sometimes called mob mentality), but actually follow inverted social norms.
>
> Dealing with riots is often a difficult task for police forces. They may use tear gas or CS gas to control rioters. Riot police may use less-than-lethal methods of control, such as shotguns that fire flexible baton rounds to injure or otherwise incapacitate rioters for easier arrest.
