## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Self-determination** refers to a people's right to form its own political entity, 
> and internal self-determination is the right to representative government with full suffrage.
>
> Self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law, binding, as such, 
> on the United Nations as an authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms. 
> 
> The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be 
> (whether independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation), 
> and the right of self-determination does **not** necessarily include 
> a right to an independent state for every ethnic group within a former colonial territory. 
> Further, no right to secession is recognized under international law.
>
> The concept emerged with the rise of nationalism in the 19th century 
> and came into prominent use in the 1860s, spreading rapidly thereafter. 
> 
> During and after World War I, a general principle of self-determination 
> was proclaimed by United States President Woodrow Wilson and others. 
> 
> Having announced his Fourteen Points on 8 January 1918, 
> on 11 February 1918, Wilson stated: "National aspirations must be respected; people may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent. 'Self determination' is not a mere phrase; it is an imperative principle of action." However, neither Wilson and Lloyd George nor Lenin and Trotsky considered the peoples of the Global South as the main target for their statements supporting self-determination. Nevertheless, their rhetoric resonated far beyond the European audiences they aimed to reach. During World War II, the principle was included in the Atlantic Charter, jointly declared on 14 August 1941 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It was recognized as an international legal right after it was explicitly listed as a right in the UN Charter.
>
> Implementing the right to self-determination can be politically difficult, 
> in part because there are multiple interpretations of what constitutes a people 
> and which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. 
> 
> As World Court judge Ivor Jennings put it: 
> "the people cannot decide until somebody decides who are the people".
