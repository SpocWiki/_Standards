## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Absolute monarchy is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign is the sole source of political power, 
> unconstrained by constitutions, legislatures or other checks on their authority. 
>
> The absolutist system of government saw its high point in Europe during the 16th and 17th century, 
> associated with a form of rule **unconstrained by the former checks of feudalism**, 
> embodied by figures such as Louis XIV of France. 
> 
> Attempting to establish an absolutist government along continental lines, 
> Charles I of England viewed Parliament as unnecessary, 
> which excess would ultimately lead to the English Civil War (1642–1651) and his execution. 
> 
> Absolutism declined substantially, first following the French Revolution, 
> and later after World War I, both of which led to the popularization of modes of government 
> based on the notion of popular sovereignty. 
> 
> Nonetheless, it provided an ideological foundation for the newer political theories and movements 
> that emerged to oppose liberal democracy, such as Legitimism and Carlism in the early 19th century, 
> or "integral nationalism" in the early 20th century.
>
> Absolute monarchies include Brunei, Eswatini, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, 
> and the individual emirates composing the United Arab Emirates, 
> which itself is a federation of such monarchies – a federal monarchy. 
> 
> Though absolute monarchies are sometimes supported by legal documents 
> (such as the King's Law of Denmark-Norway), 
> they are distinct from constitutional monarchies, in which the authority of the monarch is restricted 
> (e.g. by legislature or unwritten customs) or balanced by that of other officials, 
> such as a prime minister, as is in the case of the United Kingdom, or the Nordic countries.
>
> Absolute monarchies are similar to but should not be confused with hereditary dictatorships 
> such as North Korea or Ba'athist Syria.
