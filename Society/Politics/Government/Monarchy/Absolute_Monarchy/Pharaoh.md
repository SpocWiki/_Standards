> **Pharaoh** was a title of the monarch of ancient Egypt. 
> The earliest confirmed instance of the title used contemporaneously for a ruler 
> is a letter to Akhenaten (reigned c. 1353–1336 BCE), 
> possibly preceded by an inscription referring to Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BCE). 
> 
> Although the title only came into use in the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom, 
> scholars today use it for all the rulers of Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) 
> until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Republic in 30 BCE.
>
> In the early dynasties, ancient Egyptian kings had as many as three titles: 
> the Horus, the Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj), and the Two Ladies or Nebty (nbtj) name. 
> The Golden Horus and the nomen titles were added later.
>
> In Egyptian society, religion was central to everyday life. 
> One of the roles of the king was as an intermediary between the deities and the people. 
> 
> The king thus was deputised for the deities in a role that was 
> both as civil and religious administrator. 
> 
> The king owned all of the land in Egypt, enacted laws, collected taxes, 
> and served as commander-in-chief of the military. 
> 
> Religiously, the king officiated over religious ceremonies and chose the sites of new temples. 
> The king was responsible for maintaining Maat (mꜣꜥt), or cosmic order, balance, and justice, 
> and part of this included going to war when necessary to defend the country 
> or attacking others when it was believed that this would contribute to Maat, such as to obtain resources.
>
> During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, 
> the Deshret or the "Red Crown", was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt, 
> while the Hedjet, the "White Crown", was worn by the kings of Upper Egypt. 
> 
> After the unification of both kingdoms, the Pschent, 
> the combination of both the red and white crowns became the official crown of the pharaoh. 
> 
> With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties 
> such as the Khat, Nemes, Atef, Hemhem crown, and Khepresh. 
> At times, a combination of these headdresses or crowns worn together was depicted.
