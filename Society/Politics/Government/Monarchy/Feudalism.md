> **Feudalism**, also known as the feudal system, was a combination of legal, economic, military, 
> cultural, and political customs that flourished in medieval Europe from the 9th to 15th centuries. 
> Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships 
> derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. 
>
> The classic definition, by FranÃ§ois Louis Ganshof (1944), 
> describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations of the warrior nobility 
> and revolved around the key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs. 
> 
> A broader definition, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), 
> includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility 
> but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: 
> - the nobility, 
> - the clergy, and 
> - the peasantry, 
> all of whom were bound by a system of manorialism; 
> this is sometimes referred to as a "feudal society". 
>
> Although it is derived from the Latin word feodum or feudum (fief), 
> which was used during the medieval period, 
> the term feudalism and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system 
> by the people who lived during the Middle Ages. 
> 
> Since the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown's "The Tyranny of a Construct" (1974) 
> and Susan Reynolds's Fiefs and Vassals (1994), 
> there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians 
> as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.
