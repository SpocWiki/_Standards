## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Empire** is a realm controlled by an emperor or an empress 
> and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries. 
> 
> The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) has political control over the peripheries. 
> Within an empire, different populations may have different sets of rights and may be governed differently. 
> 
> The word "empire" derives from the Roman concept of imperium. 
> Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state uses the title of "emperor" or "empress"; 
> but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called "empires" 
> or are ruled by an emperor; 
> nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians 
> (the Central African Empire of 1976 to 1979, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).
>
> There have been "ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign" empires. 
> An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, 
> such as the Ummayad caliphate, Achaemenid Empire, the Mongol Empire, or the Russian Empire; 
> and those - based on sea-power - which include territories that are remote from the 'home' country of the empire, 
> such as the Dutch colonial empire, the Empire of Japan, the Chola Empire or the British Empire.
>
> Aside from the more formal usage, the concept of empire in popular thought 
> is associated with such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, 
> with "imperialism" referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations 
> and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. 
> 
> The word "empire" can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), 
> to a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss) or by a group (political bosses). 
> "Empire" is often used as a term to describe overpowering situations causing displeasure.
