# [[Fiefdom]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A fief (Latin: feudum) was a central element in medieval contracts based on feudal law. 
> It consisted of a form of property holding or other rights granted by an overlord to a vassal, 
> who held it in fealty or "in fee" in return for a form of feudal allegiance, services or payments. 
> 
> The fees were often lands, land revenue or revenue-producing real property like a watermill, 
> held in feudal land tenure: these are typically known as fiefs or **Fiefdom**s. 
> 
> However, not only land but anything of value could be held in fee, 
> including governmental office, rights of exploitation such as hunting, 
> fishing or felling trees, monopolies in trade, money rents and tax farms. 
> 
> There never existed a standard feudal system, nor did there exist only one type of fief. 
> Over the ages, depending on the region, 
> there was a broad variety of customs using the same basic legal principles in many variations.
