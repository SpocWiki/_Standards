## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A personal union is a combination of two or more monarchical states 
> that have the same monarch while their boundaries, laws, and interests remain distinct. 
> 
> A real union, by contrast, 
> involves the constituent states being to some extent interlinked, 
> such as by sharing some limited governmental institutions. 
> 
> Unlike a personal union, in a federation or a unitary state, 
> a central (federal) government spanning all member states exists, 
> with the degree of self-governance distinguishing the two. 
> The ruler in a personal union does not need to be a hereditary monarch.
>
> The term was coined by German jurist Johann Stephan PÃ¼tter, 
> introducing it into Elementa iuris publici germanici (Elements of German Public Law) of 1760.
>
> Personal unions can arise for several reasons, such as:
> - inheritance through a dynastic union, e.g., 
>   Louis X of France inherited France from his father and Navarre from his mother
> - decolonization, where ex-colonies install the monarch of the former colonizing power 
>   as their own upon becoming independent, e.g., 
>   several former members of the British Empire (then becoming Commonwealth realms)
> - autonomization, e.g., instead of annexing Finland into the Russian Empire, 
>   Alexander I of Russia organized Finland as an autonomous grand duchy and acted as its head of state
>
> They can also be codified (i.e., the constitutions of the states clearly express that they shall share the same person as head of state) or non-codified, in which case they can easily be broken (e.g., by the death of the monarch when the two states have different succession laws).
>
> The concept of a personal union has only very rarely crossed over from monarchies into republics.
>
> There are currently two personal unions in the world: the 15 Commonwealth realms, who share Charles III as their head of state, and one of the co-princes of Andorra being the President of France.
