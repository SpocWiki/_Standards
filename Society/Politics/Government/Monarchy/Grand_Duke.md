> historically by the sovereigns of former independent countries, such as Tuscany (from 1569 to 1860, now part of Italy)
> in Baden, Hesse, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (officially simply the Grand Duchy of Saxony) – grand duchies from 1815 to 1918, and all now part of Germany
