## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Count** (feminine: countess) is a historical title of nobility in certain European countries, 
> varying in relative status, generally of middling rank in the hierarchy of nobility. 
> Especially in earlier medieval periods the term often implied not only a certain status, 
> but also that the count had specific responsibilities or offices. 
> The etymologically related English term "county" 
> denoted the territories associated with some countships, but not all. 
>
> The title of count is typically not used in England or English-speaking countries, 
> and the term earl is used instead. 
> A female holder of the title is still referred to as a countess, however.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Graf** (German pronunciation: [ɡʁaːf] ; feminine: Gräfin [ˈɡʁɛːfɪn] ) 
> is a historical title of the German nobility and later also of the Russian nobility, 
> usually translated as "count". 
> 
> Considered to be intermediate among noble ranks, 
> the title is often treated as equivalent to the British title of "earl" (whose female version is "countess").
>
> The German nobility was gradually divided into high and low nobility. 
> The high nobility included those counts who ruled immediate imperial 
> territories of "princely size and importance" for which they had a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet.
