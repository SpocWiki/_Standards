## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Shāh (; Persian: شاه [ˈʃɒːɦ] ) is a royal title meaning "king" in the Persian language. 
> 
> Though chiefly associated with the monarchs of Iran, 
> it was also used to refer to the leaders of numerous Persianate societies, 
> such as the Ottoman Empire, the Khanate of Bukhara and the Emirate of Bukhara, 
> the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, and various Afghan dynasties, 
> as well as among Gurkhas. 
> 
> With regard to Iranian history, in particular, 
> each ruling monarch was not seen simply as the head of the concurrent dynasty and state, 
> but as the successor to a long line of royalty 
> beginning with the original Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great. 
> 
> To this end, he was more emphatically known as the Shāhanshāh (شاهنشاه [ʃɒːhænˈʃɒːɦ]), 
> meaning "King of Kings" since the Achaemenid dynasty. 
> 
> A roughly equivalent title is Pādishāh (پادشاه; lit. 'Master King'), 
> which was most widespread during the Muslim period in the Indian subcontinent.
