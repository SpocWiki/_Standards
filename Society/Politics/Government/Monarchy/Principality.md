> A **Principality** (or sometimes princedom) is a type of monarchical state or feudal territory 
> ruled by a prince or princess. 
> 
> It can be either a sovereign state or a constituent part of a larger political entity. 
> The term "principality" is often used to describe small monarchies, 
> particularly those in Europe, where the ruler holds the title of prince or an equivalent.
>
> Historically, principalities emerged during the Middle Ages as part of the feudal system, 
> where local princes gained significant power within a king's domain. 
> This led to political fragmentation and the creation of mini-states. 
> Over time, many of these principalities consolidated into larger kingdoms and empires, 
> while others retained their independence and prospered.
>
> Sovereign principalities which exist today include Liechtenstein, Monaco, 
> and the co-principality of Andorra. 
> 
> Additionally, some royal primogenitures, such as Asturias in Spain, are styled as principalities. 
> The term is also used generically for small monarchies 
> ruled by a monarch of a lesser rank than a king, such as a grand duke.
>
> Principalities have played a significant role in European history, 
> particularly within the Holy Roman Empire, 
> but they fell out of favour with the development of nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
> 
> The concept of a principality has also been applied in various forms 
> across different regions and historical periods.
