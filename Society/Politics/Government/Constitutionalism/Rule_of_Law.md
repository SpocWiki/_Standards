## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The essence of the rule of law is that **all** people and institutions within a political body 
> are subject to the same laws. 
> 
> This concept is sometimes stated simply as "no one is above the law" 
> or "all are equal before the law". 
> 
> According to Encyclopædia Britannica, it is defined as 
> "the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm 
> that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, 
> and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power."
>
> Legal scholars have expanded the basic rule of law concept 
> to encompass, first and foremost, a requirement that laws apply equally to everyone. 
> "Formalists" add that the laws must be stable, accessible and clear. 
> 
> More recently, "substantivists" expand the concept to include rights, 
> such as human rights, and compliance with international law.
>
> Use of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain. 
> In the following century, Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it 
> in arguing against the divine right of kings. 
> 
> John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws written by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions of liberty. 
> 
> The phrase "rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. 
> However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. 
> Aristotle wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens."
>
> The term rule of law is closely related to [[../Constitutionalism|Constitutionalism]] as well as [[Rechtsstaat]]. 
> It refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule. 
> Distinct is the rule of man, where one person or group of persons rule arbitrarily.
