> (such as distinguishing between 
> - master and enslaved person, 
> - householder and their relatives, 
> - employer and their employees, 
> - parent and a child, 
> - political representative and their voters, etc.), 
> and discursive forms, as categories and language 
> may lend legitimacy to some behaviors and groups over others.
