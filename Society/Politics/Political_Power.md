Political Power is always given by groups of supporters.

they can decide to remove this Support or even go into Opposition. 

Economic or military Power may be used to increase political Power, 
which can eventually be used to change Societies and continuate Power Concentration.

> In political science, power is the ability to influence or direct the actions, beliefs, or conduct of actors. 
> Power does not exclusively refer to the threat or use of force (coercion) by one actor against another, 
> but may also be exerted through diffuse means (such as institutions). 
>
> Power may also take **structural forms**, as it orders actors in relation to one another 
> (such as distinguishing between 
> - master and enslaved person, 
> - householder and their relatives, 
> - employer and their employees, 
> - parent and a child, 
> - political representative and their voters, etc.), 
> and discursive forms, as categories and language 
> may lend legitimacy to some behaviors and groups over others.
>
> The term [[Political_Power/Authority]] is often used for power that is perceived as 
> legitimate or socially approved by the social structure.
>
> Scholars have distinguished between soft power and hard power.
