they can decide to remove this Support or even go into Opposition.

> In political science, power is the ability to influence or direct the actions, beliefs, or conduct of actors. 
> Power does not exclusively refer to the threat or use of force (coercion) by one actor against another, 
> but may also be exerted through diffuse means (such as institutions). 
>
> Power may also take **structural forms**, as it orders actors in relation to one another 
> (such as distinguishing between 
> - master and enslaved person, 
> - householder and their relatives, 
> - employer and their employees, 
> - parent and a child, 
> - political representative and their voters, etc.), 
> and discursive forms, as categories and language 
> may lend legitimacy to some behaviors and groups over others.
>
> The term [[Political_Power/Authority]] is often used for power that is perceived as 
> legitimate or socially approved by the social structure.
>
> Scholars have distinguished between soft power and hard power.
