> Public speaking is the practice of delivering speeches to a live audience. 
> 
> Throughout history, public speaking has held 
> significant cultural, religious, and political importance, 
> emphasizing the necessity of effective rhetorical skills. 
> 
> It allows individuals to connect with a group of people to discuss any topic. 
> The goal as a public speaker may be to educate, teach, or influence an audience. 
> Public speakers often utilize visual aids like a slideshow, pictures, 
> and short videos to get their point across. 
>
> The ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius, a key figure in the study of public speaking, advocated for speeches that could profoundly affect individuals, including those not present in the audience. He believed that words possess the power to inspire actions capable of changing the world. In the Western tradition, public speaking was extensively studied in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where it was a fundamental component of rhetoric, analyzed by prominent thinkers.
>
> Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, identified three types of speeches: deliberative (political), forensic (judicial), and epideictic (ceremonial or demonstrative). Similarly, the Roman philosopher and orator Cicero categorized public speaking into three purposes: judicial (courtroom), deliberative (political), and demonstrative (ceremonial), closely aligning with Aristotle's classifications. 
>
> In modern times, public speaking remains a highly valued skill in various sectors, including government, industry, and advocacy. It has also evolved with the advent of digital technologies, incorporating video conferencing, multimedia presentations, and other innovative forms of communication.
