> The executive is the part of the government that executes or enforces the law. 
> It can be organised as a branch of government, as in liberal democracies, 
> or as an organ of the unified state apparatus, as is the case in communist states.

## Ministers

In parliamentary systems, the executive is responsible to the elected legislature, 
which must maintain the confidence of the legislature or one part of it, if bicameral. 

In certain circumstances (varying by state), 
the legislature can express its lack of confidence in the executive, 
which causes either a change in the governing party or group of parties or a general election. 

Parliamentary systems have a head of government (who leads the executive, often called ministers) 
normally distinct from the head of state (who continues through governmental and electoral changes). 

the top leadership roles of the executive branch may include:
- head of state – often the monarch, the president or the supreme leader, 
  the chief representative and living symbol of national unity.
	- head of government – often the prime minister, 
	  overseeing the administration of all affairs of state.
		- defence minister – overseeing the armed forces, determining [[../../Military|military]] policy, 
		  and managing external safety.
		- interior minister – overseeing the [[Executive_Branch/Police|police]] forces, enforcing the law, 
		  and managing internal control.
		- foreign minister – overseeing the diplomatic service, determining foreign policy 
		  and managing foreign relations.
		- finance minister – overseeing the treasury, determining fiscal policy 
		  and managing national budget.
		- justice minister – overseeing criminal prosecutions, corrections, 
		  enforcement of court orders.
