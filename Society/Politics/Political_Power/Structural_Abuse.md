# [[Structural_Abuse]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Structural abuse is the process by which 
> an individual or group is dealt with unfairly by a social or cultural system or authority. 
> 
> This unfairness manifests itself as abuse in a psychological, financial, physical or spiritual form, 
> and victims often are unable to protect themselves from harm. 
> 
> An individual's inability to protect themselves may lead to their entrapment in the system, 
> preventing them from seeking justice or recompense for crimes endured and damages incurred, 
> creating a feeling of isolation or helplessness. 
>
> Systems containing abusive structures are primarily designed to control individuals 
> or manipulate them for material gain.  
> 
> Most social systems contain at least one structure that induces structural abuse. 
> These structures, when allowed to exist, create a cycle of abuse, 
> wherein the abuse is repetitive or contagious in nature, 
> and may become acceptable in other parts of the system.
>
> Structural abuse differs to structural violence in terms of scale – 
> structural violence is a process occurring within an entire society, such as racism or classism, 
> while structural abuse refers to a specific element of society, or a specific system within society. 
> 
> Abuse occurring on this smaller scale is not necessarily endorsed by wider society, 
> such as modern witch hunts, which have been condemned in South Africa, 
> regardless of deaths that still occur in areas retaining anti-Pagan social structures.
