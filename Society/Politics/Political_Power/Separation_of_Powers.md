## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The separation of powers principle functionally differentiates several types of state power 
> (usually law-making, adjudication, and execution) 
> and requires these operations of government to be 
> conceptually and institutionally distinguishable and articulated, thereby maintaining the integrity of each. 
> 
> To put this model into practice, government is divided into structurally independent branches 
> to perform various functions (most often a legislature, a judiciary and an administration, AKA trias politica). 
> 
> When each function is allocated strictly to one branch, 
> a government is described as having a high degree of separation; 
> whereas, when one person or branch plays a significant part in the exercise of more than one function, 
> this represents a fusion of powers. 
> 
> When one branch holds unlimited state power and delegates its powers to other organs as it sees fit, 
> as is the case in communist states, that is called unified power.
