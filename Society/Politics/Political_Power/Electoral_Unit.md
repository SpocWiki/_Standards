> An electoral (congressional, legislative, etc.) district, sometimes called a constituency, riding, or ward, 
> is a geographical portion of a political unit, such as a country, state or province, city, or administrative region, 
> created to provide the voters therein with representation in a legislature or other polity. 
> 
> That legislative body, the state's constitution, or a body established for that purpose 
> determines each district's boundaries 
> and whether each will be represented by a single member or multiple members. 
> 
> Generally, only voters (constituents) who reside within the district are permitted to vote in an election held there. 
> The district representative or representatives may be elected by single-winner 
> first-past-the-post system, a multi-winner proportional representative system, 
> or another voting method. 
>
> The district members may be selected by a direct election under wide adult enfranchisement, 
> an indirect election, or direct election using another form of suffrage.
