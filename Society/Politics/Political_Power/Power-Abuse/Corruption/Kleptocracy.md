> **Kleptocracy** (from Greek κλέπτης kléptēs, "thief", or κλέπτω kléptō, "I steal", 
> and -κρατία -kratía from κράτος krátos, "power, rule"), also referred to as thievocracy, 
> is a government whose corrupt leaders (kleptocrats) use political power 
> to expropriate the wealth of the people and land they govern, 
> typically by embezzling or misappropriating government funds 
> at the expense of the wider population. 
> 
> One feature of political-based socioeconomic thievery is 
> that there is often no public announcement explaining or apologizing for misappropriations, 
> nor any legal charges or punishment levied against the offenders.
>
> Kleptocracy is different from [[Plutocracy]] (rule by the richest) and [[Oligarchy]] (rule by a small elite). 
> In a kleptocracy, corrupt politicians enrich themselves secretly outside the rule of law, 
> through kickbacks, bribes, and special favors from lobbyists and corporations, 
> or they simply direct state funds to themselves and their associates. 
> Also, kleptocrats often export much of their profits to foreign nations in anticipation of losing power.
>
> According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first use in English 
> occurs in the publication Indicator of 1819: "Titular ornaments, common to Spanish kleptocracy."
