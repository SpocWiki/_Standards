> **Oligarchy** (from Ancient Greek  ὀλιγαρχία (oligarkhía) 'rule by few'; from  ὀλίγος (olígos) 'few' 
> and  ἄρχω (árkhō) 'to rule, command') is a form of 
> government in which power rests with a small number of people. 
> These people may or may not be distinguished by one or several characteristics, 
> such as nobility, fame, wealth, education, or corporate, religious, political, or military control.
>
> Throughout history, power structures considered to be oligarchies 
> have often been viewed as coercive, relying on public obedience or oppression to exist. 
> Aristotle pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich, contrasting it with aristocracy, 
> arguing that oligarchy was the perverted form of aristocracy.
