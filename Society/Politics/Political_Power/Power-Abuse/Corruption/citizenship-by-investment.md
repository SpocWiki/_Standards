## Countries That Sell Citizenship

Several countries offer citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programs, 
allowing individuals to acquire citizenship in exchange for a financial contribution. 
These programs generally fall into two categories: 
- direct investment-based citizenship and 
- fast-tracked naturalization through investment.

### **1. Countries With Official Citizenship-by-Investment Programs**

These countries have legally established programs that grant citizenship in exchange for a direct financial contribution, often with no residency requirements.

|**Country**|**Minimum Investment Required (USD)**|**Processing Time (Months)**|**Residency Requirement**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Antigua & Barbuda**|100,000 (donation) / 200,000 (real estate)|3–6|5 days in 5 years|
|**Dominica**|100,000 (donation) / 200,000 (real estate)|3–6|None|
|**Grenada**|150,000 (donation) / 220,000 (real estate)|3–6|None|
|**Saint Kitts & Nevis**|250,000 (donation) / 400,000 (real estate)|2–6|None|
|**Saint Lucia**|100,000 (donation) / 300,000 (real estate)|3–6|None|
|**Turkey**|400,000 (real estate)|3–6|None|
|**Malta**|738,000 (donation) + 700,000 (real estate)|12–36|12 months|
|**Vanuatu**|130,000 (donation)|1–2|None|

### **2. Countries With Fast-Track Naturalization Through Investment**

These countries do not offer direct citizenship but grant it faster than usual if the applicant makes a significant financial contribution.

|**Country**|**Investment Requirement (USD)**|**Time to Citizenship**|**Residency Requirement**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Portugal**|500,000 (real estate) / 500,000 (funds)|5 years|7 days per year|
|**Greece**|250,000 (real estate)|7 years|Must maintain investment|
|**Spain**|500,000 (real estate)|10 years|Must live in Spain|
|**United Arab Emirates**|1,000,000 (real estate)|Case-by-case basis|Must maintain investment|
|**Montenegro**|450,000 (real estate)|10 years|Must live in Montenegro|

### **3. Controversies & Restrictions**

- **EU Regulations:** The European Union has pressured Malta and Cyprus (which suspended its CBI program in 2020) to phase out citizenship-for-investment programs.
- **U.S. Sanctions:** The U.S. has raised concerns about Caribbean CBI programs being used for money laundering and imposed stricter visa policies.
- **Russia & China Restrictions:** Many CBI programs exclude applicants from sanctioned countries, including Russia and Iran.
