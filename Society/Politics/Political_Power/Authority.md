> **Authority** is commonly understood as the legitimate 
> power of a person or group over other people. 
> 
> In a civil state, authority is practiced by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. 
> 
> The term authority has many nuances and distinctions within various academic fields ranging from  sociology to political science.
>
> In the exercise of governance, 
> the terms authority and power are inaccurate synonyms. 
> 
> The term authority identifies the political legitimacy, 
> which grants and justifies the ruler's right to exercise the power of government; 
> and the term power identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal, 
> either by compliance or by obedience; hence, 
> authority is the power to make decisions 
> and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution.
