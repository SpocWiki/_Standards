> An electoral or voting system is a set of rules used to determine the results of an election. 
> Electoral systems are used in politics to elect governments, 
> while non-political elections may take place in business, nonprofit organizations and informal organisations. 
> 
> These rules govern all aspects of the voting process: 
> - when elections occur, 
> - who is allowed to vote, 
> - who can stand as a candidate, 
> - how ballots are marked and cast, 
> - how the ballots are counted, 
> - how votes translate into the election outcome, 
> - limits on campaign spending, 
> - and other factors that can affect the result. 
> 
> Political electoral systems are defined by constitutions and electoral laws, 
> are typically conducted by election commissions, 
> and can use multiple types of elections for different offices.
>
> Some electoral systems elect a single winner to a unique position, 
> such as prime minister, president or governor, 
> while others elect multiple winners, such as members of parliament or boards of directors. 
> When electing a legislature, areas may be divided into constituencies with one or more representatives or the electorate may elect representatives as a single unit. Voters may vote directly for an individual candidate or for a list of candidates put forward by a political party or alliance. There are many variations in electoral systems.
>
> The mathematical and normative study of voting rules 
> falls under the branches of economics called social choice and mechanism design, 
> but the question has also engendered substantial contributions from political scientists, 
> analytic philosophers, computer scientists, and mathematicians. 
> 
> The field has produced several major results, including Arrow's impossibility theorem 
> (showing that ranked voting cannot eliminate the spoiler effect) 
> and Gibbard's theorem (showing it is impossible to design a straightforward voting system, 
> i.e. one where it is always obvious to a strategic voter which ballot they should cast).
