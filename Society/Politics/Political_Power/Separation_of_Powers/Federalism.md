## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Federalism** is a mode of government 
> that combines a general level of government  (a central or federal government) 
> with a regional level of sub-unit governments (e.g., provinces, states, cantons, territories, etc.), 
> while dividing the powers of governing between the two levels of governments. 
> 
> Two illustrative examples of federated countries—
> - Australia, one of the world's oldest federations, and 
> - Micronesia, one recently organized federation.
>
> Johannes Althusius (1563–1638) is considered the father of modern federalism, along with Montesquieu. 
> In 1603, Althusius first described the bases of this political philosophy 
> in his Politica Methodice Digesta, Atque Exemplis Sacris et Profanis Illustrata. 
> By 1748, in his treatise The Spirit of Law, 
> Montesquieu (1689-1755) observed various examples of federalist governments: 
> in corporate societies, in the polis bringing villages together, 
> and in cities themselves forming confederations. 
> 
> In the modern era Federalism was 
> first adopted by a union of the states of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] as of the mid-14th century.
>
> Federalism differs from confederalism, 
> where the central government is created subordinate to the regional states—
> and is notable for its regional-separation of governing powers 
> (e.g., in the United States, the Articles of Confederation as the general level of government of the original Thirteen Colonies; and, later, the Confederate States of America). 
> And federalism also differs from the unitary state, 
> where the regional level is subordinate to the central/federal government, 
> even after a devolution of powers—
> and is notable for regional-integration of governing powers, (e.g., the United Kingdom). 
>
> **Federalism is at the midpoint** of variations 
> on the pathway (or spectrum) of regional-integration or regional-separation. 
> It is bordered on the increasing-separation side by confederalism, 
> and on the increasing-integration side by devolution within a unitary state; (see "pathway" graphic).
>
> Some characterize the European Union as a pioneering example of federalism in a multi-state setting—
> with the concept termed a "federal union of states", 
> as situated on the pathway (spectrum) of regional-integration or regional-separation.
>
> Examples of federalism today, i.e., the federation of a central/federal government 
> with regional sub-unit governments, include:  
> - Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Iraq, Malaysia, Mexico, Micronesia, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Venezuela.
