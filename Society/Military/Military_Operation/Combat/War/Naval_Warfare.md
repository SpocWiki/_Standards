## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, 
> or any other battlespace involving a major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.
>
> The armed forces branch designated for naval warfare is a navy. 
> Naval operations can be broadly divided into 
> - riverine/littoral applications (brown-water navy), 
> - open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), 
> - between riverine/littoral and open-ocean applications (green-water navy), 
> although these distinctions are more about strategic scope 
> than tactical or operational division. 
> 
> The strategic offensive purpose of naval warfare is projection of force by water, 
> and its strategic defensive purpose is to challenge the similar projection of force by enemies.
