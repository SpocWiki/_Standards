## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Conventional warfare is a form of warfare conducted by 
> using conventional weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more states in open confrontation. 
> 
> The forces on each side are well-defined and fight by 
> using weapons that target primarily the opponent's military. 
> It is normally fought by using conventional weapons, 
> not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons.
>
> The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military, which negates its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics.
