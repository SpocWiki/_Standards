> Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (10 March 1957 – 2 May 2011) 
> was a Saudi-born militant leader who was the founder and first general emir of al-Qaeda. 
> 
> Ideologically a pan-Islamist, Bin Laden participated in the Afghan mujahideen 
> during the Soviet–Afghan War of the 1980s, 
> and supported the Bosnian mujahideen during the Bosnian War of the 1990s. 
> 
> Opposed to American foreign policy in the Middle East, 
> Bin Laden declared war on the United States in 1996 
> and advocated attacks targeting U.S. assets in various countries, 
> and supervised the execution of the September 11 attacks inside the U.S. in 2001.
>
> Born in Riyadh to the aristocratic bin Laden family, 
> he studied at Saudi and foreign universities until 1979, 
> when he joined the mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
> In 1984, he co-founded Maktab al-Khidamat, which recruited foreign mujahideen into the war. 
> 
> As the Soviet war in Afghanistan came to an end, 
> Bin Laden founded al-Qaeda in 1988 to carry out worldwide jihad. 
> 
> In the Gulf War, Bin Laden's offer of support to Saudi Arabia against Iraq 
> was rejected by the Saudi royal family, which instead sought American aid.
>
> Bin Laden's views on pan-Islamism and anti-Americanism 
> resulted in his expulsion from Saudi Arabia in 1991. 
> 
> He shifted his headquarters to Sudan until 1996, 
> when he established a new base in Afghanistan, where he was supported by the Taliban. 
> Bin Laden declared two fatāwā in August 1996 and February 1998, 
> declaring holy war against the U.S. 
> 
> After al-Qaeda's bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, which killed hundreds of civilians, 
> he was indicted by a U.S. district court and listed on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists 
> and Most Wanted Fugitives lists. 
> In October 1999, the United Nations designated al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization.
>
> Bin Laden organized the September 11 attacks, 
> which killed nearly 3,000 people, mostly civilians. 
> 
> This resulted in the U.S. invading Afghanistan and launching the war on terror. 
> Bin Laden became the subject of a nearly decade-long international manhunt led by the U.S. 
> 
> During this period, he hid in the mountains of Afghanistan 
> and later escaped to neighboring Pakistan. 
> 
> On 2 May 2011, Bin Laden was killed by U.S. special operations forces 
> at his compound in Abbottabad. 
> 
> His corpse was buried in the Arabian Sea 
> and he was succeeded by his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri on 16 June 2011. 
> 
> During his lifetime, Bin Laden became a symbol of terrorism 
> and was reviled in the United States and elsewhere 
> as a mass murderer due to his orchestration of numerous attacks and bombings.
