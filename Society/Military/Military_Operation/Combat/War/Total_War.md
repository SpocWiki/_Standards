## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Total war is a type of warfare that mobilizes the totality of national resources 
> to sustain war production, blurring the line between military and civilian activities 
> and legitimates attacks on civilian targets as part of a war 
> without restriction as to the combatants, territory or objectives involved. 
>
> The term has been defined as "A war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, 
> the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, 
> especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded."
>
> In the mid-19th century, 
> scholars identified  what  later became known as total war as a separate class of warfare. 
> 
> In a total war, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes 
> due to the capacity of opposing sides to consider nearly every human, 
> including non-combatants, as resources that are used in the war effort.
