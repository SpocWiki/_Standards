> A **Duel** is an arranged engagement in combat between two people with matched weapons.
>
> During the 17th and 18th centuries (and earlier), 
> duels were mostly single combats fought with swords (the rapier and later the small sword), 
> but beginning in the late 18th century in England, 
> duels were more commonly fought using pistols. 
> Fencing and shooting continued to coexist throughout the 19th century.
>
> The duel was based on a code of honor. 
> Duels were fought not to kill the opponent but to gain "satisfaction", 
> that is, to restore one's honor by demonstrating a willingness to risk one's life for it. 
> 
> As such, the tradition of dueling was reserved for the male members of nobility; 
> however, in the modern era, it extended to those of the upper classes. 
> On occasion, duels with swords or pistols were fought between women.
>
> Legislation against dueling dates back to the medieval period. 
> The Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) outlawed duels 
> and civil legislation in the Holy Roman Empire against dueling 
> was passed in the wake of the Thirty Years' War.
>
> From the early 17th century, duels became illegal in the countries where they were practiced. Dueling largely fell out of favour in England by the mid-19th century 
> and in Continental Europe by the turn of the 20th century. 
> Dueling declined in the Eastern United States in the 19th century 
> and by the time of the American Civil War, dueling had begun to wane even in the South. 
> 
> Public opinion, not legislation, caused the change. 
> Research has linked the decline of dueling to increases in state capacity.
