> **Salami slicing tactics**, also known as salami slicing, salami tactics, the salami-slice strategy, 
> or salami attacks, is the practice of using a series of many small actions 
> to produce a much larger action or result 
> that would be difficult or unlawful to perform all at once.
> 
> Salami tactics are a generally subversive strategy used extensively in geopolitics, 
> such as countries attempting to expand their borders, and war games 
> as a method of **achieving goals gradually without provoking significant escalation**.
> 
> Perhaps the most famous example of the salami tactic was through WWII and into the start of the cold war, with the formation of the Eastern Bloc in Europe by the USSR. By the time WWII ended, Eastern Europe was under the control of the Soviets. This advantage was used to ensure the election of submissive communist satellite states in several countries.

> As a result, from 1945 to 1949 through a series of slices, the USSR was able to bring

> under its control **without escalating incidents** between its near peer adversaries.
> 
> In finance, the term "salami attack" is used to describe schemes by which 
> large sums are fraudulently accumulated by repeated transfers 
> of imperceptibly small sums of money.
