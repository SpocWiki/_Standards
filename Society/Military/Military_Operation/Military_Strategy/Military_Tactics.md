> Military tactics encompasses the art of 
> organizing and employing fighting forces on or near the battlefield. 
> 
> They involve the application of four battlefield functions which are closely related 
> - kinetic or firepower, 
> - mobility, 
> - protection or security, and 
> - shock action. 
> 
> Tactics are a separate function from [[../../Military_Organization/Military_Rank/Command_and_Control|Command_and_Control]] and [[../../Military_Logistics|Military logistics]]. 
> In contemporary military science, tactics are the lowest of three levels of warfighting, 
> the higher levels being the [[../Military_Strategy|Military_Strategy]] and [[../../Military_Operation|Military_Operation]]. 
> 
> Throughout history, there has been a shifting balance between the four tactical functions, 
> generally based on the application of military technology, which has led to one or more of the tactical functions being dominant for a period of time, usually accompanied by the dominance of an associated fighting arm deployed on the battlefield, such as infantry, artillery, cavalry or tanks.
