## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A scorched-earth policy is a military strategy of destroying anything 
> that allows an enemy military force to be able to fight a war, 
> including the deprivation and destruction of water, food, humans, animals, plants 
> and any kind of tools and infrastructure. 
> 
> Its use is possible by a retreating army to leave nothing of value worth taking, 
> to weaken the attacking force, or by an advancing army to fight against unconventional warfare.
>
> Scorched earth against non-combatants 
> has been banned under the 1977 Geneva Conventions.
>
> It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, 
> or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, 
> such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, 
> crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, 
> for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population 
> or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, 
> whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.
