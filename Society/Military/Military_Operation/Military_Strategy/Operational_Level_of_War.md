> In the field of military theory, the operational level of war (also called operational art, 
> as derived from Russian: оперативное искусство, or operational warfare) 
> represents the level of command that connects the details of tactics with the goals of strategy. 
> In other words, it involves creating, through successful tactics 
> in the theater of military operations, the conditions needed for strategic success.
>
> In U.S.  Joint military doctrine, operational art is 
> "the cognitive approach by commanders and  staffs—
> supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—
> to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces 
> by integrating ends, ways, and means". 
> 
> It correlates political requirements with military power. 
> Operational art is defined by its **military-political scope**, 
> not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. 
> Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, 
> and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process. 
>
> The operational level of war is concerned with four essential elements: 
> time, space, means, and purpose. 
> 
> Through means such as directing troops and allocating (limited) resources (among others), 
> operational art aims to achieve political goals 
> by producing an optimal (or at least near-optimal) generation and application of military power. 
> 
> For example, proposals may be generated to identify where to build defensive structures, 
> how many, what kind, and manned by how many troops; 
> a proposal may be accepted, or reworked. 
> During the 20th century, the nascent field of [[../../../../Mathematics/Optimization(Math)/Operations_Research|Operations_Research]] flourished 
> as a result of military efforts to improve  logistics and decision-making.
>
> The operational level of war sits between tactics 
> (which consists of organizing and employing fighting forces on or near the battlefield) 
> and strategy (which involves aspects of long-term and high-level  theatre operations, and government leadership).
>
> The Soviet Union was the first country 
> to officially distinguish this third level of military thinking, 
> which was introduced as part of the deep operation military theory 
> that Soviet armed forces developed during the 1920s and 1930s 
> and utilized during the Second World War.
