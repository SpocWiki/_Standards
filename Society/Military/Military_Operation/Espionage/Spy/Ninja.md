> A **Ninja** (忍 (にん)者 (じゃ); English: , Japanese: [ɲiꜜɲ.dʑa]), shinobi no mono (忍 (しの)びの者 (もの); Japanese: [ɕi.no.bʲi no mo.noꜜ]) or shinobi (忍 (しの)び; Japanese: [ɕi.no.bʲi]) 
> was a  spy and infiltrator in pre-modern Japan. 
> 
> The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding. 
> Antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century. 
> There is little evidence that they were assassins.
>
> In the unrest of the Sengoku period, jizamurai families, that is, 
> elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed ikki – 
> "revolts" or "leagues" – as a means of self-defense. 
> 
> They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions 
> and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. 
> It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. 
> 
> Following the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. 
> A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, 
> were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).
>
> By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), 
> shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. 
> 
> Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, 
> where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, 
> and control over natural elements. 
> 
> Much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore, 
> as opposed to the covert actors of the Sengoku period.
