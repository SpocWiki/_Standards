> **Samurai** (侍) were members of the warrior class 
> who served as retainers to lords in Japan prior to the Meiji era. 
> 
> Samurai existed from the late 12th century 
> until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era. 
> They were originally provincial warriors who served the Kuge and imperial court in the late 12th century.
>
> In 1853, the United States forced Japan to open its borders to foreign trade 
> under the threat of military action. 
> 
> Fearing an eventual invasion, the Japanese abandoned feudalism for capitalism 
> so that they could industrialize and build a modern army. 
> The adoption of modern firearms rendered the traditional weapons of the samurai obsolete, 
> and as firearms are easy enough for peasant conscripts to learn, 
> Japan had no more need for a specialized warrior caste. 
> 
> By 1876 the special rights and privileges of the samurai had all been abolished.
