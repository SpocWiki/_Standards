> Harold Adrian Russell "Kim" Philby (1 January 1912 â€“ 11 May 1988) 
> was a British intelligence officer and a double agent for the Soviet Union. 
> In 1963, he was revealed to be a member of the Cambridge Five, 
> a spy ring that had divulged British secrets to the Soviets during World War II and in the early stages of the Cold War. 
> Of the five, Philby is believed to have been the most successful in providing secret information to the Soviets.
>
> Born in British India, Philby was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. 
> He was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1934. 
> After leaving Cambridge, Philby worked as a journalist, covering the Spanish Civil War and the Battle of France. 
> In 1940, he began working for the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6). 
> By the end of the Second World War he had become a high-ranking member.
>
> In 1949, Philby was appointed first secretary to the British Embassy in Washington

>
> Philby was suspected of tipping off two other spies under suspicion of Soviet espionage, 
> Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, both of whom subsequently fled to Moscow in May 1951. 
> Under suspicion himself, Philby resigned from MI6 in July 1951 
> but was publicly exonerated by then-Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan in 1955. 
> 
> He resumed his career as both a journalist and a spy for MI6 in Beirut, 
> but was forced to defect to Moscow after finally being unmasked as a Soviet agent in 1963.
