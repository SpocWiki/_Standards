> Command and control (abbr. C2) is a "set of organizational and technical attributes and processes ... [that] 
> employs human, physical, and information resources to solve problems and accomplish missions" 
> to achieve the goals of an organization or enterprise, 
> according to  a 2015 definition by military scientists Marius Vassiliou, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre. 
> The term often refers to a military system.
>
> Versions of the United States Army Field Manual 3-0 circulated circa 1999 
> define C2 in a military organization as 
> the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commanding officer 
> over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of a mission.
>
> A 1988 NATO definition is that command and control is the exercise of authority and direction 
> by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal. 
> 
> An Australian Defence Force definition, similar to that of NATO, emphasises that 
> C2 is the system empowering designated personnel to exercise lawful authority and direction 
> over assigned forces for the accomplishment of missions and tasks. 
> 
> The Australian doctrine goes on to state: 
> "The use of agreed terminology and definitions is fundamental to any C2 system 
> and the development of joint doctrine and procedures. 
> The definitions in the following paragraphs have some agreement internationally, 
> although not every potential ally will use the terms with exactly the same meaning."
