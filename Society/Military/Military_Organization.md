> Military organization (AE) or military organisation (BE) 
> is the structuring of the armed forces of a state so as 
> to offer such military capability as a national defense policy may require. 
> 
> Formal military organization tends to use hierarchical forms 
> (see Modern hierarchy for terminology and approximate troop strength per hierarchical unit).
>
> In some countries, paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces, 
> though not considered military. 
> 
> Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, 
> such as insurgent forces, often emulate military organizations, or use these structures.
