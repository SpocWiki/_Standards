## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Armoured warfare is the use of armoured fighting vehicles in modern warfare. 
> It is a major component of modern methods of war. 
> The premise of armored warfare rests on the ability of troops 
> to penetrate conventional defensive lines through use of manoeuvre by armoured units.
>
> Much of the application of armoured warfare depends on the use of tanks and related vehicles used by other supporting arms such as infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and other combat vehicles, as well as mounted combat engineers and other support units. The doctrine of armored warfare was developed to break the static nature of World War I trench warfare on the Western Front, and return to the 19th century school of thought that advocated manoeuvre and decisive battle outcomes in military strategy.
