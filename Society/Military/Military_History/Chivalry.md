> **Chivalry**, or the chivalric language, is an informal and varying code of conduct 
> that developed in Europe between 1170 and 1220. 
> 
> It is associated with the medieval Christian institution of knighthood, 
> with knights being members of various chivalric orders, 
> and with knights' and gentlemen's behaviours 
> which were governed by chivalrous social codes. 
> 
> The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, 
> particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, 
> relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, 
> and the Matter of Britain, informed by Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, 
> written in the 1130s, 
> which popularized the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table. 
>
> The code of chivalry that developed in medieval Europe had its roots in earlier centuries. 
> It arose in the Carolingian Empire from the idealisation of the cavalryman—
> involving military bravery, individual training, and service to others—
> especially in Francia, among horse soldiers in Charlemagne's cavalry.
>
> Over time, the meaning of chivalry in Europe has been refined 
> to emphasize more general social and moral virtues. 
> The code of chivalry, as it stood by the Late Middle Ages, 
> was a moral system which combined a warrior ethos, knightly piety, and courtly manners, 
> all combining to establish a notion of honour and nobility.
