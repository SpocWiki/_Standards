## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The expression military–industrial complex (MIC) describes 
> the relationship between a country's military and the defense industry that supplies it, 
> seen together as a vested interest which influences public policy. 
> 
> A driving factor behind the relationship between the military 
> and the defense-minded corporations is that both sides benefit—
> one side from obtaining weapons, and the other from being paid to supply them. 
> 
> The term is most often used in reference to 
> the system behind the armed forces of the United States, 
> where the relationship is most prevalent due to 
> close links among defense contractors, the Pentagon, and politicians. 
> 
> The expression gained popularity after a warning of the relationship's detrimental effects, 
> in the farewell address of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 17, 1961.
>
> Conceptually, it is closely related to the ideas of the iron triangle in the U.S. 
> (the relationship between Congress, the executive branch bureaucracy, and interest groups) 
> and the defense industrial base (the network of organizations, facilities, and resources that supplies governments with defense-related goods and services).
