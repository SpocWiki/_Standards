## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In geopolitics, an **Invasion** typically refers to a military offensive 
> in which a polity sends combatants, usually in large numbers, 
> to forcefully enter the territory of another polity, 
> with either side possibly being supported by one or more allies. 
> 
> While strategic goals for an invasion can be numerous and complex in nature, 
> the foremost tactical objective normally involves militarily occupying part or all of the invaded polity's territory. 
> 
> Today, if a polity conducts an invasion 
> without having been attacked by their opponent beforehand, 
> it is widely considered to constitute an international crime and condemned as an act of aggression. 
>
> Historically, invasions have variously been associated with conquest and annexation, 
> self-defence (if the invader was attacked first), liberation of the invaded polity's people 
> (or of territory that had been occupied by it), 
> or the establishment or re-establishment of control or authority over a territory. 
> Other common motives include forcing the partition of a polity, 
> toppling or altering the established government of a polity 
> or gaining concessions from said government, 
> or intervening to support a belligerent in a polity's civil war. 
>
> An invasion can be the cause of a war, be a part of a larger strategy to end a war, 
> or it can constitute an entire war in itself. 
> Due to the large scale of the military operations associated with invasions, 
> they are usually strategic in planning and execution.
