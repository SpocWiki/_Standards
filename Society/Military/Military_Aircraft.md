> A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft 
> that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary military of any type. 
> 
> Some military aircraft engage directly in aerial warfare, while others take on support roles:
> 
> Combat aircraft, such as fighters and bombers, are designed to destroy enemy equipment or personnel using their own ordnance. Combat aircraft are typically developed and procured only by military forces.
>
> Non-combat aircraft, such as transports and tankers, are not designed for combat as their primary function but may carry weapons for self-defense. 
> These mainly operate in support roles, and may be developed by either military forces or civilian organizations.
