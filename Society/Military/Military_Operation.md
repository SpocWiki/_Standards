> A military operation (op) is the coordinated military actions of a state, or a non-state actor, 
> in response to a developing situation. 
> 
> These actions are designed as a military plan to resolve the situation in the state or actor's favor. 
> 
> Operations may be of a combat or non-combat nature 
> and may be referred to by a code name for the purpose of national security. 
> 
> Military operations are often known for their more generally accepted common usage names 
> than their actual operational objectives.
