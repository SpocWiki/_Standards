> Killed in action (KIA) is a casualty classification generally 
> used by militaries to describe the deaths of their personnel 
> at the hands of enemy or hostile forces at the moment of action. 
> 
> The United States Department of Defense, for example, says that those declared KIA 
> did not need to have fired their weapons, but only to have been killed due to hostile attack. 
> 
> KIAs include those killed by friendly fire during combat, 
> but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes, murder, 
> or other non-hostile events or terrorism. 
> KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and naval, air, and support forces.
