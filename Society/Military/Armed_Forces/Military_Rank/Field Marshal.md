> **Field Marshal** (or field-marshal, abbreviated as FM) is the most senior military rank, 
> senior to the general officer ranks. 
> Usually, it is the highest rank in an army (in countries without the rank of Generalissimo), 
> and as such, few persons are ever appointed to it. 
> It is considered as a five-star rank (OF-10) in modern-day armed forces in many countries.
>
> Promotion to the rank of field marshal in many countries 
> historically required extraordinary military achievement by a general (a wartime victory). 
> 
> However, the rank has also been used as a divisional command rank 
> and as a brigade command rank.  
> 
> Examples of the different uses of the rank include Afghanistan, Austria-Hungary, India, Pakistan, Prussia/Germany and Sri Lanka for an extraordinary achievement; Spain and Mexico for a divisional command (Spanish: mariscal de campo); and France, Portugal and Brazil for a brigade command (French: maréchal de camp, Portuguese: marechal de campo).
