> **Sergeant** (Sgt) is a rank in use by the armed forces of many countries. 
> It is also a police rank in some police services. 
> 
> The alternative spelling, serjeant, is used in The Rifles and in other units 
> that draw their heritage from the British light infantry. 
> The word "sergeant" derives from the Latin serviens, 'one who serves', 
> through the Old French term serjant.
>
> In modern hierarchies the term sergeant refers to 
> a non-commissioned officer positioned above the rank of corporal, 
> or to a police officer immediately below a lieutenant in the United States, 
> or below an inspector in the United Kingdom. 
> 
> In most armies, a sergeant commands a squad or a section. 
> In Commonwealth armies, it is a more senior rank, 
> corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command. 
> 
> In the United States Army, sergeant is a more junior rank corresponding to a fireteam leader or assistant squad-leader; while in the United States Marine Corps the rank is typically held by squad leaders. 
>
> More senior non-commissioned ranks often have titles with variations on "sergeant", for example: staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant, master sergeant, first sergeant, and sergeant major.
>
> In many nations and services, the rank insignia for a sergeant consists of three chevrons.
