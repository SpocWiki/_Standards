## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Commander-in-chief** or supreme commander (supreme commander-in-chief) 
> is the person who exercises supreme command and control over an armed force or a military branch. 
> 
> As a technical term, it refers to military competencies that reside in a country's executive leadership, 
> a head of state, head of government, or other designated government official.
>
> While often used interchangeably, the title of Supreme Commander–in–Chief is technically different, 
> since the two titles can be in use simultaneously. 
> 
> For example, in the case of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 
> the supreme commander-in-chief is the president of Ukraine, 
> while the commander-in-chief is its professional head.
