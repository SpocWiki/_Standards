## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships 
> within armed forces, police, intelligence agencies and other institutions organized along military lines. Responsibility for personnel, equipment and missions grows with each advancement. 
> The military rank system defines dominance, authority and responsibility within a military hierarchy. 
> It incorporates the principles of exercising power and authority into the military chain of command—
> the succession of commanders superior to subordinates through which command is exercised. 
> The military chain of command is an important component for organized collective action.
>
> Uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms of a number of countries. 
> Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, 
> in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination. 
> As time went on and military operations became larger and more complex, 
> more ranks were created and the systems of ranking became more complex.
>
> Rank is not only used to designate leadership, but to establish pay-grade as well. 
> As rank increases, pay-grade follows, but so does the amount of responsibility. 
>
> In modern armed forces, the use of ranks is almost universal. 
> Communist states have, on several occasions, abolished the use of ranks (e.g., the Soviet Red Army 1918–1935, the Chinese People's Liberation Army 1965–1988, and the Albanian People's Army 1966–1991), 
> but they have had to re-establish them after encountering operational difficulties in command and control.
