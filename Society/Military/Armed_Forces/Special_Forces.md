## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Special forces or special operations forces (SOF) 
> are military units trained to conduct special operations. 
> 
> NATO has defined special operations as "military activities 
> conducted by specially designated, organized, selected, trained and equipped forces 
> using unconventional techniques and modes of employment".
>
> Special forces emerged in the early 20th century, 
> with a significant growth in the field during World War II, when 
> "every major army involved in the fighting" created formations 
> devoted to special operations behind enemy lines. 
> 
> Depending on the country, special forces may perform functions including 
> - airborne operations, counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, covert ops, direct action, hostage rescue, high-value targets/manhunt, intelligence operations, mobility operations, and unconventional warfare.
>
> In Russian-speaking countries, special forces of any country are typically called spetsnaz, 
> an acronym for "special purpose". 
> 
> In the United States, the term special forces 
> often refers specifically to the U.S. Army Special Forces, 
> while the term special operations forces is used more broadly for these types of units.
