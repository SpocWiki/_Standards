## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A military uniform is a standardised dress 
> worn by members of the armed forces and paramilitaries of various nations.
>
> Military dress and styles have gone through significant changes over the centuries, 
> from colourful and elaborate, ornamented clothing until the 19th century, 
> to utilitarian camouflage uniforms for field and battle purposes from World War I (1914–1918) on. 
> 
> Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, 
> intended for identification and display, 
> are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority.
>
> Military uniforms differ not only according to military units 
> but tend to also be offered in different levels of formality 
> in accordance with Western dress codes: 
> - full dress uniform for formal wear, 
> - mess dress uniform for formal evening wear, 
> - service dress uniform for informal wear, and 
> - combat uniform (also called "battle/field dress") which would equal casual wear. 
> Sometimes added to the casual wear category is physical training uniforms. 
> 
> The study used to design and produce military uniforms is referred to as military textile science.
