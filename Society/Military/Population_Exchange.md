> Population transfer or resettlement is a type of mass migration 
> that is often imposed by a state policy or international authority. 
> 
> Such mass migrations are most frequently spurred on the basis of ethnicity or religion, 
> but they also occur due to economic development. 
> Banishment or exile is a similar process, but is forcibly applied to individuals and groups. 
> 
> Population transfer differs more than simply technically from individually motivated migration, 
> but at times of war, the act of fleeing from danger or famine often blurs the differences.
>
> Often the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region, 
> perhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. 
> In addition, the process implies the loss of immovable property 
> and substantial amounts of movable property when rushed. 
> 
> This transfer may be motivated by the more powerful party's desire 
> to make other uses of the land in question or, less often, 
> by security or disastrous environmental or economic conditions that require relocation.
>
> The first known population transfers date back to the Middle Assyrian Empire 
> in the 13th century BCE, with forced resettlement being 
> particularly prevalent during the Neo-Assyrian Empire. 
> 
> The single largest population transfer in history was the Partition of India in 1947 
> that involved up to 12 million people in Punjab Province 
> with a total of up to 20 million people across British India, 
> with the second largest being the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II, 
> which involved more than 12 million people.

> Before the forcible deportation of Ukrainians (including thousands of children) to Russia 
> during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
> the last major population transfer in Europe was the deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians 
> during the Kosovo War in 1999. 
> Moreover, some of the largest population transfers in Europe 
> have been attributed to the ethnic policies of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.
>
> Population transfers can also be imposed to further economic development, 
> for instance China relocated 1.3 million residents in order to  construct  the [[../../../../../../../../Technology/Engineering/Civil_Engineering/Construction/Dam/Three_Gorges_Dam|Three_Gorges_Dam]] .
