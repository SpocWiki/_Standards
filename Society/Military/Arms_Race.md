## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An arms race occurs when two or more groups compete in military superiority. 
> It consists of a competition between two or more states to have superior armed forces, 
> concerning production of weapons, the growth of a military, and the aim of superior military technology. 
> 
> Unlike a sporting race, which constitutes a specific event 
> with winning interpretable as the outcome of a singular project, 
> arms races constitute spiralling systems of on-going and potentially open-ended behavior.
>
> The existing scholarly literature is divided as to whether arms races correlate with war. International-relations scholars explain arms races in terms of the security dilemma, engineering spiral models, states with revisionist aims, and deterrence models.
