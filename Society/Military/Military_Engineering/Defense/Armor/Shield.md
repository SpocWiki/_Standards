> A **Shield** is a piece of personal armour held in the hand, 
> which may or may not be strapped to the wrist or forearm. 
> 
> Shields are used to intercept specific attacks, 
> whether from close-ranged weaponry like spears 
> or long ranged projectiles such as arrows. 
> 
> They function as means of active blocks, as well as to provide passive protection 
> by closing one or more lines of engagement during combat.
>
> Shields vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from 
> large panels that protect the user's whole body 
> to small models (such as the buckler) that were intended for hand-to-hand-combat use. 
> 
> Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; 
> whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking 
> to protect soldiers from the impact of spears and crossbow bolts, 
> others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes 
> (like the roromaraugi or qauata). 
> 
> Finally, shields vary greatly in shape, ranging in roundness to angularity, 
> proportional length and width, symmetry and edge pattern; 
> different shapes provide more optimal protection for infantry or cavalry, 
> enhance portability, provide secondary uses such as ship protection or as a weapon and so on.
>
> In prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilisations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or wicker. In classical antiquity, the Barbarian Invasions and the Middle Ages, they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry.
>
> Depending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial or scalloped. Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eye-hole, to look through when used with combat. The shield was held by a central grip or by straps with some going over or around the user's arm and one or more being held by the hand.
>
> Often shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. It was common for Aristocratic officials such and knights, barons, dukes, and kings to have their shields painted with customary designs known as a coat of arms. These designs developed into systematized heraldic devices during the High Middle Ages for purposes of battlefield identification. Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. In the 18th century, for example, Scottish Highland fighters liked to wield small shields known as targes, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as Zulu warriors) employed them when waging wars.
>
> In the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking.
