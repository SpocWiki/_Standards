> **Heraldry** (also known as armory) is a discipline relating to the design, display, study 
> and transmission of armorial bearings. 
> Heraldic achievements are formally described in a blazon.
> A full heraldic achievement may include a coat of arms on a shield, helmet and crest, 
> together with accompanying devices, such as supporters, badges, heraldic banners and mottoes. 
>
> Although the use of various devices to signify individuals and groups goes back to antiquity, 
> both the form and use of such devices varied widely, 
> as the concept of regular, hereditary designs, 
> constituting the distinguishing feature of heraldry, did not develop until the High Middle Ages. 
> 
> It is often claimed that the use of helmets with face guards during this period 
> made it difficult to recognize one's commanders in the field 
> when large armies gathered together for extended periods, 
> necessitating the development of heraldry as a symbolic language, 
> but there is little support for this view.
>
> The perceived beauty and pageantry of heraldic designs 
> allowed them to survive the gradual abandonment of armour on the battlefield 
> during the seventeenth century. 
> 
> Heraldry has been described poetically as "the handmaid of history", 
> "the shorthand of history", and "the floral border in the garden of history".  
> In modern times, individuals, public and private organizations, corporations, 
> cities, towns, regions, and other entities use heraldry and its conventions 
> to symbolize their heritage, achievements, and aspirations.
>
> Related disciplines include vexillology (the study of flags), 
> genealogy, and the studies of ceremony and rank.
