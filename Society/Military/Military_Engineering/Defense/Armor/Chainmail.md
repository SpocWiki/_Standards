> Mail (sometimes spelled maille and, since the 18th century, 
> colloquially referred to as chain mail, **Chainmail** or chain-mail) 
> is a type of armour consisting of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. 
> 
> It was in common military use between the 3rd century BC and the 16th century AD in Europe, 
> while it continued to be used militarily in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East 
> as late as the 18th century. 
> 
> Even today it is still in use in industries such as butchery 
> and as protection against the powerful bites of creatures such as sharks. 
> A coat of this armour is often called a hauberk or sometimes a byrnie.
