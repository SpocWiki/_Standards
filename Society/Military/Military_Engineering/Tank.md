> A **Tank** is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat. Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; their main armament is often mounted within a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.
>
> Modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapons platforms 
> whose main armament is a large-calibre tank gun mounted in a rotating gun turret, 
> supplemented by machine guns or other ranged weapons 
> such as anti-tank guided missiles or rocket launchers. 
> 
> They have heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew, 
> the vehicle's munition storage, fuel tank and propulsion systems. 
> 
> The use of tracks rather than wheels provides improved operational mobility 
> which allows the tank to overcome rugged terrain and adverse conditions 
> such as mud and ice/snow better than wheeled vehicles, 
> and thus be more flexibly positioned at advantageous locations on the battlefield. 
> 
> These features enable the tank to perform in a variety of intense combat situations, 
> simultaneously both offensively (with direct fire from their powerful main gun) 
> and defensively (as fire support and defilade for friendly troops 
> due to the near invulnerability to common infantry small arms 
> and good resistance against heavier weapons, 
> although anti-tank weapons used in 2022, some of them man-portable, 
> have demonstrated the ability to destroy older generations of tanks with single shots), 
> all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations. 
> 
> Fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat, armoured warfare.
>
> Until the invention of the main battle tank, tanks were typically categorized 
> - either by weight class (light, medium, heavy or superheavy tanks) 
> - or doctrinal purpose (breakthrough-, cavalry-, infantry-, cruiser-, or reconnaissance tanks). 
> 
> Some are larger and more thickly armoured and with large guns, 
> while others are smaller, lightly armoured, and equipped with a smaller caliber and lighter gun. 
> 
> These smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility 
> and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging hostile targets. 
> 
> The smaller, faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger, 
> heavily armoured tank, except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre.
