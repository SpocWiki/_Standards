> A battering ram is a siege engine that originated in ancient times 
> and was designed to break open the masonry walls of fortifications 
> or splinter their wooden gates. 
> 
> In its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log 
> carried by several people and propelled with force against an obstacle; 
> the ram would be sufficient to damage the target if the log were massive enough 
> and/or it were moved quickly enough (that is, if it had enough momentum). 
> 
> Later rams encased the log in an arrow-proof, fire-resistant canopy mounted on wheels. 
> Inside the canopy, the log was swung from suspensory chains or ropes.
>
> Rams proved effective weapons of war because at the time wall-building materials 
> such as stone and brick were weak in tension, 
> and therefore prone to cracking when impacted with force. 
> With repeated blows, the cracks would grow steadily until a hole was created. 
> Eventually, a breach would appear in the fabric of the 
> wall, enabling armed attackers to force their way through the gap 
> and engage the inhabitants or garrison of the fortified place.
>
> The introduction in the later Middle Ages of siege cannons, 
> which harnessed the explosive power of gunpowder 
> to propel weighty stone or iron balls against fortified obstacles, 
> spelled the end of battering rams and other traditional siege weapons. 
> 
> Smaller, hand-held versions of battering rams are still used today 
> by law enforcement officers and military personnel to break open locked doors.
>
> A capped ram is a battering ram that has an accessory at the head 
> (usually made of iron or steel 
> and sometimes punningly shaped into the head and horns of an ovine ram) 
> to do more damage to a building. 
> It was much more effective at destroying enemy walls and buildings than an uncapped ram 
> but was heavier to carry.
