> A **Boomerang** is a thrown tool typically constructed with airfoil sections 
> and designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight, 
> designed to return to the thrower. 
> 
> The origin of the word is from an Aboriginal Australian language of the Sydney region. 
> Its original meaning, which is preserved in official competitions, 
> refer only to returning objects, not to throwing sticks, 
> which were also used for hunting by various peoples both in Australia and around the world. 
> 
> However, the term "non-returning boomerang" is also in general use. 
> Various forms of boomerang-like designs were traditionally and in some cases 
> are still used by some groups of Aboriginal Australians for hunting. 
> 
> The tools were known by various names in the many Aboriginal languages prior to colonisation. 
> The oldest surviving Aboriginal boomerang, now held in the South Australian Museum, 
> was found in a peat bog in South Australia, dated to 10,000 BC. 
> Historically, boomerangs have been used for hunting, sport, and entertainment, 
> and are made in various shapes and sizes to suit different purposes. 
> Ancient "boomerangs", used for hunting, have also been discovered in Egypt, the Americas, 
> and Europe, although it is unclear whether any of these were of the returning type.
