> A **Spear** is a polearm consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a pointed head. 
> 
> The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, 
> as is the case with fire hardened spears, 
> or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft, 
> such as bone, flint, obsidian, copper, bronze, iron, or steel. 
> 
> The most common design for hunting and/or warfare, 
> since modern times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle, diamond, or leaf. 
> The heads of fishing spears usually feature multiple sharp points, with or without barbs.
>
> Spears can be divided into two broad categories: 
> - those designed for thrusting as a melee weapon (including weapons such as lances and pikes) 
> - and those designed for throwing as a ranged weapon (usually referred to as javelins).
>
> The spear has been used throughout human history 
> as a weapon for hunting and/or fishing and for warfare. 
> 
> Along with the club, knife, and axe, 
> it is one of the earliest and most widespread tools ever developed by early humans. 
> 
> As a weapon, it may be wielded with either one or two hands. 
> It was used in virtually every conflict up until the modern era, where even to this day, 
> it lives on in the form of a bayonet fixed onto the muzzle of a long gun.
>
> Early humans progressively invented tools and techniques for trapping animals. 
> 
> The earliest spears were crafted from wood, with tips toughened by burning. 
> By 15,000 BC, hunters employed wooden and bone 
> spear-launchers to enhance force and distance. 
> 
> These devices were frequently adorned with carvings of creatures.
