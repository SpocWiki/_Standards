> A **Flamethrower** is a ranged incendiary device designed to project a controllable jet of fire. 
> First deployed by the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century AD, 
> flamethrowers saw use in modern times during World War I, 
> and more widely in World War II as a tactical weapon against fortifications.
>
> Most military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either heated oil or diesel, 
> but commercial flamethrowers are generally blowtorches using gaseous fuels such as propane. 
> Gases are safer in peacetime applications 
> because their flames have less mass flow rate and dissipate faster and often are easier to extinguish.
>
> Apart from the military applications, flamethrowers have peacetime applications 
> where there is a need for controlled burning, 
> such as in sugarcane harvesting and other land-management tasks. 
> Various forms are designed for an operator to carry, while others are mounted on vehicles.
