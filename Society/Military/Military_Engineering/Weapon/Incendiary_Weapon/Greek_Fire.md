> Greek fire was an incendiary weapon system used by the Byzantine Empire 
> from the seventh to the fourteenth centuries. 
> 
> The recipe for Greek fire was a closely-guarded state secret; 
> historians have variously speculated that it was based on saltpeter, sulfur, or quicklime, 
> but most modern scholars agree that it was based on petroleum mixed with resins, 
> comparable in composition to modern [[Napalm]]. 
> 
> Byzantine sailors would toss grenades loaded with Greek fire onto enemy ships 
> or spray it from tubes. 
> Its ability to burn on water made it an effective and destructive naval incendiary weapon, 
> and rival powers tried unsuccessfully to copy the material.
