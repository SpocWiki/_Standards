# [[Artillery]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Artillery** consists of ranged weapons that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. 
> Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, 
> and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. 
> 
> As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons were developed for battlefield use. 
> This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles 
> are highly mobile weapons of great versatility 
> generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.
>
> Originally, the word "artillery" referred to any group of soldiers 
> primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour. 
> 
> Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, "artillery" has largely meant cannon, 
> and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars 
> (collectively called barrel artillery, cannon artillery or gun artillery) and rocket artillery. 
> 
> In common speech, the word "artillery" is often used to refer to individual devices, 
> along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called "equipment". 
> 
> However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: 
> the United States uses "artillery piece", but most English-speaking armies use "gun" and "mortar". 
> 
> The projectiles fired are typically either "shot" (if solid) or "shell" (if not solid). 
> Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used. 
> "Shell" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions.
>
> By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines. 
> In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; 
> in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility.
>
> In the 20th century, target acquisition devices (such as radar) 
> and techniques (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged, primarily for artillery. 
> These are usually utilized by one or more of the artillery arms. 
> 
> The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century 
> introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, 
> and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm. 
> 
> The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery. 
> In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was "the god of war".
