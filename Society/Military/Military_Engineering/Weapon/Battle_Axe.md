## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A battle axe (also battle-axe, battle ax, or battle-ax) is an axe specifically designed for combat. 
> Battle axes were designed differently to utility axes, with blades 
> more akin to cleavers than to wood axes. 
> Many were suitable for use in one hand, 
> while others were larger and were deployed two-handed.
>
> Axes designed for warfare ranged in weight from just over 0.5 to 3 kg (1 to 7 lb), 
> and in length from just over 30 cm (1 ft) to upwards of 150 cm (5 ft), 
> as in the case of the Danish axe or the sparth axe. 
> Cleaving weapons longer than 150 cm (5 ft) would arguably fall into the category of polearms.
