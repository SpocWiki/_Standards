> A weapon of mass destruction (WMD) is a 
> biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, or any other weapon 
> that can kill or significantly harm many people 
> or cause great damage to artificial structures (e.g., buildings), 
> natural structures (e.g., mountains), or the biosphere. 
> 
> The scope and usage of the term has evolved and been disputed, 
> often signifying more politically than technically. 
> 
> Originally coined for aerial bombing with chemical explosives during World War II, 
> it has later come to refer to large-scale weaponry of warfare-related technologies, 
> such as biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear warfare.
>
> The histories of biological and chemical warfare date from antiquity to the modern period, with toxic gases used on a vast scale in World War I. In the 20th century, nuclear weapons were first developed, and were used in war twice, in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Biotechnology allowed for the enhancement of pathogens as weapons, and advanced chemical weapons such as nerve agents were developed. Radiological weapons have never been used or mass-produced.
>
> Nuclear weapons were mass-produced in the Cold War's nuclear arms race, and as of 2025 are possessed by nine countries, while 185 countries pledge not to acquire them via the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 1975 Biological Weapons Convention and 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention seek complete elimination by all parties, but are challenged by a small number of non-signatory states, and by violations.
