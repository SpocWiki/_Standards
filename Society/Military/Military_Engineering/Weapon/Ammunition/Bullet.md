## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Bullet** is a kinetic projectile, a component of firearm ammunition that is shot from a gun barrel. 
> They are made of a variety of materials, such as copper, lead, steel, polymer, rubber 
> and even wax; and are made in various shapes and constructions 
> (depending on the intended applications), including specialized functions 
> such as hunting, target shooting, training, and combat. 
> 
> Bullets are often tapered, making them more aerodynamic. 
> Bullet size is expressed by weight and diameter (referred to as "caliber") 
> in both imperial and metric measurement systems. 
> 
> Bullets do not normally contain explosives but strike or damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration.
