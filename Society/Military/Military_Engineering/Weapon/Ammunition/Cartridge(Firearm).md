> A **Cartridge**, also known as a round, 
> is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging 
> - a projectile (bullet, shot, or slug), 
> - a propellant substance (smokeless powder, black powder substitute, or black powder) and 
> - an ignition device (primer) within a metallic, paper, or plastic case 
> that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun, 
> for convenient transportation and handling during shooting. 
> Although in popular usage the term "bullet" 
> is often used to refer to a complete cartridge, 
> the correct usage only refers to the projectile.
>
> Military and commercial producers continue to pursue the goal of caseless ammunition. 
> Some artillery ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in small arms. 
> In other cases, the artillery shell is separate from the propellant charge.
>
> A cartridge without a projectile is called a blank; 
> one that is completely inert (contains no active primer and no propellant) 
> is called a dummy; 
> one that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a dud; 
> and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel 
> is called a squib.
