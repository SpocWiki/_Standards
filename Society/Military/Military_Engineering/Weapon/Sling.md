> A sling is a projectile weapon typically used to hand-throw a blunt projectile such as a stone, clay, or lead "sling-bullet". 
> It is also known as the shepherd's sling or slingshot (in British English, although elsewhere it means something else). 
> Someone who specializes in using slings is called a slinger.
>
> A sling has a small cradle or pouch in the middle of two retention cords, where a projectile is placed. 
> There is a loop on the end of one side of the retention cords. 
> Depending on the design of the sling, either the middle finger or the wrist is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, 
> and a tab at the end of the other cord is placed between the thumb and forefinger. 
> 
> The sling is swung in an arc, and the tab released at a precise moment. 
> This action releases the projectile to fly inertially and ballistically towards the target. 
> By its double-pendulum kinetics, the sling enables stones (or spears) to be thrown much further than they could be by hand alone.
>
> The sling is inexpensive and easy to build. 
> 
> Historically it has been used for hunting game and in combat. 
> 
> Today the sling is of interest as a wilderness survival tool and an improvised weapon.
