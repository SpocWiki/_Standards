## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A grenade is a small explosive [[../../../Weapon|weapon]] typically thrown by hand (also called hand grenade), 
> but can also refer to a shell (explosive projectile) shot from the muzzle of a rifle 
> (as a rifle grenade) or a grenade launcher. 
> 
> A modern hand grenade generally consists of an explosive charge ("filler"), 
> a detonator mechanism, an internal striker to trigger the detonator, 
> an arming safety secured by a transport safety. 
> 
> The user removes the transport safety before throwing, 
> and once the grenade leaves the hand the arming safety gets released, 
> allowing the striker to trigger a primer that ignites a fuze (called the delay element), 
> which burns down to the detonator and explodes the main charge.
>
> Grenades work by dispersing 
> - fragments (fragmentation grenades), 
> - shockwaves (high-explosive and stun grenades), 
> - chemical aerosols (smoke, gas and chemical grenades), 
> - fire (incendiary grenades) or a  
> - jet of molten metal (anti-tank grenades). 
> 
> Their outer casings, generally made of a hard synthetic material or steel, 
> are designed to rupture and fragment on detonation, 
> sending out numerous fragments (shards and splinters) as fast-flying projectiles. 
> 
> In modern grenades, a pre-formed fragmentation matrix inside the grenade 
> is commonly used, which may be spherical, cuboid, wire or notched wire. 
> Most anti-personnel (AP) grenades are designed to detonate either after a time delay or on impact.
>
> Grenades are often spherical, cylindrical, ovoid or truncated ovoid in shape, 
> and of a size that fits the hand of an average-sized adult. 
> 
> Some grenades are mounted at the end of a handle and known as "stick grenades". 
> 
> The stick design provides leverage for throwing longer distances, 
> but at the cost of additional weight and length, and has been considered obsolete 
> by western countries since the Second World War and Cold War periods. 
> 
> A friction igniter inside the handle or on the top of the grenade head was used to initiate the fuse.
