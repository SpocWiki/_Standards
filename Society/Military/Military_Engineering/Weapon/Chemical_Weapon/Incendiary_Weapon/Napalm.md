## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Napalm** is an incendiary mixture of a gelling agent 
> and a volatile petrochemical (usually gasoline or diesel fuel). 
> 
> The name is a portmanteau of two of the constituents of the original thickening and gelling agents: 
> coprecipitated aluminium salts of naphthenic acid and palmitic acid. 
> 
> A team led by chemist Louis Fieser originally developed napalm 
> for the US Chemical Warfare Service in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University. 
> 
> Of immediate first interest was its viability as an incendiary device 
> to be used in American fire bombing campaigns during World War II; 
> its potential to be coherently projected into a solid stream that would carry for distance 
> (instead of the bloomy fireball of pure gasoline) 
> resulted in widespread adoption in infantry and tank/boat mounted [[Flamethrower]]s as well.
>
> Napalm burns at temperatures ranging from 800 to 1,200 °C (1,470 to 2,190 °F). 
> It burns longer than gasoline, is more easily dispersed, and adheres to its targets. 
> These traits make it both effective and controversial. 
> 
> It has been widely used from the air and from the ground, 
> the largest use having been via airdropped bombs in World War II 
> in the incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in 1945. 
> 
> It was used also for close air support roles by the U.S military 
> in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and various others. 
> 
> Napalm has also fueled most of the flamethrowers (tank-, ship-, and infantry-based) 
> used since World War II, giving them much greater range.
