> Tear gas, also known as a lachrymatory agent or lachrymator (from Latin  lacrima 'tear'), 
> sometimes colloquially known as "mace" after the early commercial self-defense spray, 
> is a chemical weapon that stimulates the nerves of the lacrimal gland in the eye to produce tears. 
> 
> In addition, it can cause severe eye and respiratory pain, 
> skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness. 
> 
> Common lachrymators both currently and formerly used as tear gas include 
> - pepper spray (OC gas), 
> - PAVA spray (nonivamide), 
> - CS gas, 
> - CR gas, 
> - CN gas (phenacyl chloride), 
> - bromoacetone, 
> - xylyl bromide, 
> - chloropicrin (PS gas) and 
> - Mace (a branded mixture).
>
> While lachrymatory agents are commonly deployed 
> for riot control by law enforcement and military personnel, 
> its use in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties. 
> During World War I, increasingly toxic and deadly lachrymatory agents were used.
>
> The short and long-term effects of tear gas are not well studied. 
> The published peer-reviewed literature consists of 
> lower quality evidence that do not establish causality. 
> 
> Exposure to tear gas agents 
> may produce numerous short-term and long-term health effects, 
> including development of respiratory illnesses, severe eye injuries and diseases 
> (such as traumatic optic neuropathy, keratitis, glaucoma, and cataracts), 
> dermatitis, damage of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, 
> and death, especially in cases with exposure to high concentrations of tear gas 
> or application of the tear gases in enclosed spaces.
