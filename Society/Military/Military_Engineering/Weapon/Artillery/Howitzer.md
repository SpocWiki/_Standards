The name **"Howitzer"** comes from the Czech word **"houfnice"**, 
which itself originates from the medieval military term **"houf"**, meaning _crowd_ or _heap_. 
It was designed to fire into masses of infantry in the [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~3~Anthropocene/Early_modern_History/CE_1600/1618-Thirty_Years_War|1618-Thirty_Years_War]].

> The **Howitzer** is an artillery weapon between a cannon (or field gun) and a mortar. 
> It is capable of both low angle fire like a field gun and high angle fire like a mortar. 
> The distinction between low and high angle fire breaks at 45 degrees or 800 mils (NATO). 
> 
> With their long-range capabilities, 
> howitzers can be used to great effect in a battery formation with other artillery pieces, 
> such as long-barreled guns, mortars, and rocket artillery.  
> 
> Howitzers were valued for their ability to fire explosive shells 
> and incendiary materials into fortifications. 
> Unlike mortars, which have fixed firing angles, 
> howitzers could be fired at various angles, providing greater flexibility in combat.
>
> In the 18th and 19th centuries, howitzers evolved to become more mobile and versatile. 
> The introduction of rifling in the mid-19th century 
> led to significant changes in howitzer design and usage. 
> 
> By the early 20th century, howitzers were classified into different categories 
> based on their size and role, including field howitzers, siege howitzers, super-heavy siege howitzers, and defence howitzers.
>
> During World War I and World War II, howitzers played significant roles in combat, 
> particularly in trench warfare and artillery-heavy strategies 
> such as the Soviet deep battle doctrine. 
> 
> In modern times, 
> the distinctions between guns and howitzers have become less pronounced, 
> with many artillery pieces combining characteristics of both. 
> Contemporary howitzers are often self-propelled, mounted on tracked or wheeled vehicles, 
> and capable of firing at high angles with adjustable propellant charges 
> for increased range and accuracy.
