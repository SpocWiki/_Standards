> A **Machete** (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈtʃete]) is a broad blade used 
> - either as an  agricultural implement similar  to an axe, 
> - or in combat like a long-bladed knife. 
> 
> The blade is typically 30 to 66 centimetres (12 to 26 in) long 
> and usually under 3 millimetres (1⁄8 in) thick. 
> 
> In the Spanish language, the word is possibly a diminutive form of the word macho, 
> which was used to refer to sledgehammers. 
> 
> Alternatively, its origin may be machaera, 
> the name given by the Greeks and Romans to the falcata. 
> 
> It is the origin of the English language  equivalent term matchet, though this is rarely used. 
> In much of the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago, the term cutlass is used for these agricultural tools.
