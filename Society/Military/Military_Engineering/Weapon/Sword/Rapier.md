> throughout the 16th and 17th centuries as a symbol of nobility or gentleman status.
>
> It is called espada ropera because it was carried as an accessory to clothing, 
> generally used for fashion and as a weapon for dueling, self-defense and as a military side arm. Its name is of Spanish origin and appears recorded for the first time in the Coplas de la panadera, by Juan de Mena, written approximately between 1445 and 1450:

> As fencing spread throughout Western Europe, important sources for rapier fencing arose in Spain, known under the term destreza ("dexterity"), in Italy and France. The French small sword or court sword of the 18th century was a direct continuation of this tradition of fencing.
>
> Rapier fencing forms part of Historical European Martial Arts. The rapier has also been widely used in theatrical productions and films. The Society of American Fight Directors recognizes rapier and dagger as one of the eight main weapon disciplines of stage combat.
