> A **Dagger** is a fighting knife with a very sharp point and usually one or two sharp edges, 
> typically designed or capable of being used as a cutting or thrusting weapon. 
> 
> Daggers have been used throughout human history for close combat confrontations, 
> and many cultures have used adorned daggers in ritual and ceremonial contexts. 
> 
> The dagger's distinctive shape and historic usage have made it iconic and symbolic. 
> In the modern sense, a dagger is designed for close-proximity combat or self-defense; 
> due to its use in historic weapon assemblages, it has associations with assassination and murder. 
> However, double-edged knives play different roles in different social contexts.
>
> A wide variety of thrusting knives have been described as daggers, 
> including knives that feature only a single cutting edge, 
> such as the European rondel dagger or the Afghan pesh-kabz, 
> or, in some instances, no cutting edge at all, such as the stiletto of the Renaissance. 
> 
> However, in the last hundred years or so, in most contexts, 
> a dagger has specific definable characteristics, including 
> - a short blade with a sharply tapered point, 
> - a central spine or fuller, and 
> - usually two cutting edges sharpened the entire length of the blade, or nearly so. 
> Most daggers also feature a full crossguard 
> to keep the hand from riding forwards onto the sharpened blade edges.
>
> Daggers are primarily weapons, so knife legislation in many places 
> restricts their manufacture, sale, possession, transport, or use.
