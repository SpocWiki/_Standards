> Only a few countries, such as Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan and the United States are considered permissive jurisdictions.
>
> In some countries, such as Australia or the United States, measures can be implemented at the national, state, or local levels. Countries like the United States and Mexico have constitutionally protected gun rights.
