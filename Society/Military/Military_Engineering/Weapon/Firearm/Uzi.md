> The **Uzi** (Hebrew: עוּזִי, romanized: ʿûzî; officially cased as UZI) 
> is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns and machine pistols 
> first designed by Major Uziel "Uzi" Gal in the late 1940s, 
> shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel. 
> 
> It is one of the first weapons to incorporate a telescoping bolt design, 
> which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.
>
> The Uzi prototype was finished in 1950. 
> It was first introduced to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) special forces in 1954, 
> and the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. 
> 
> The IDF supplied Uzis to rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tank crews, 
> as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces.
>
> The Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries. 
> Over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by Israel Military Industries, 
> FN Herstal, and other manufacturers. 
> 
> From the 1960s through to the 1980s, more Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, 
> law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.
