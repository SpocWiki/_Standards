## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An assault rifle is a select fire rifle that uses an intermediate-rifle cartridge 
> and a detachable magazine. 
> 
> Assault rifles were first put into mass production 
> and accepted into widespread service during World War II. 
> 
> The first assault rifle to see major usage was the German StG 44, 
> a development of the earlier Mkb 42. 
> 
> While immediately after World War II, NATO countries were equipped with battle rifles, 
> the development of the M16 rifle during the Vietnam War 
> prompted the adoption of assault rifles by the rest of NATO. 
> 
> By the end of the 20th century, 
> assault rifles had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, 
> replacing full-powered rifles and submachine guns in most roles. 
> 
> The two most successful modern assault rifles are the AK-47 
> and the M16 designs and their derivatives.
