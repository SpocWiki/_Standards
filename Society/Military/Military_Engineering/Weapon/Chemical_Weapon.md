> A chemical weapon (CW) is a specialized munition that uses chemicals 
> formulated to inflict death or harm on humans. 
> According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), 
> this can be any chemical compound intended as a weapon 
> "or its precursor that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation 
> through its chemical action. Munitions or other delivery devices 
> designed to deliver chemical weapons, 
> whether filled or unfilled, are also considered weapons themselves."
>
> Chemical weapons are classified as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), 
> though they are distinct from nuclear weapons, biological weapons, 
> and radiological weapons. 
> 
> All may be used in warfare and are known by the military acronym NBC 
> (for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare). 
> 
> Weapons of mass destruction are distinct from conventional weapons, 
> which are primarily effective due to their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential. 
> Chemical weapons can be widely dispersed in gas, liquid and solid forms, 
> and may easily afflict others than the intended targets. 
> Nerve gas, tear gas, and pepper spray are three modern examples of chemical weapons.
>
> Lethal unitary chemical agents and munitions are extremely volatile 
> and they constitute a class of hazardous chemical weapons 
> that have been stockpiled by many nations. 
> 
> Unitary agents are effective on their own and do not require mixing with other agents. 
> The most dangerous of these are nerve agents (GA, GB, GD, and VX) 
> and vesicant (blister) agents, which include formulations of sulfur mustard 
> such as H, HT, and HD. 
> They all are liquids at normal room temperature, but become gaseous when released. 
> Widely used during the World War I, the effects of so-called mustard gas, 
> phosgene gas, and others caused lung searing, blindness, death and maiming.
>
> During World War II the Nazi regime used a commercial hydrogen cyanide blood agent 
> trade-named Zyklon B to commit industrialised genocide against Jews 
> and other targeted populations in large gas chambers. 
> The Holocaust resulted in the largest death toll to chemical weapons in history.
>
> As of 2016, CS gas and pepper spray remain in common use for policing and riot control; 
> CS and pepper spray are considered non-lethal weapons. 
> 
> Under the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993), 
> there is a legally binding, worldwide ban on the production, stockpiling, 
> and use of chemical weapons and their precursors. 
> 
> However, large stockpiles of chemical weapons continue to exist, 
> usually justified as a precaution against possible use by an aggressor. 
> Continued storage of these chemical weapons is a hazard, 
> as many of the weapons are now more than 50 years old, raising risks significantly.
