> A club (also known as a cudgel, baton, bludgeon, truncheon, cosh, nightstick, or impact weapon) 
> is a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a weapon or tool since prehistory. 
> There are several examples of blunt-force trauma caused by clubs in the past, 
> including at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, 
> described as the scene of a prehistoric conflict between bands of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.
>
> Most clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand, 
> although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective. 
> Various specialized clubs are used in martial arts and other fields, 
> including the law-enforcement baton. 
> 
> The military mace is a more sophisticated descendant of the club, 
> typically made of metal and featuring a spiked, knobbed, or flanged head attached to a shaft.
>
> Examples of cultural depictions of clubs may be found in mythology, 
> where they are associated with strong figures such as Hercules or the Japanese oni, 
> or in popular culture, where they are associated with primitive cultures, especially cavemen. 
> 
> Ceremonial maces may also be displayed as a symbol of governmental authority.
