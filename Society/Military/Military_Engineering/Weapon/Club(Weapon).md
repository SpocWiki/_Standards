> is a short staff or stick, usually made of wood, wielded as a weapon or tool since prehistory. 
> There are several examples of blunt-force trauma caused by clubs in the past, 
> including at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, 
> described as the scene of a prehistoric conflict between bands of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.
>
> Most clubs are small enough to be swung with one hand, 
> although larger clubs may require the use of two to be effective.
