> **incendiary weapon**s, incendiary devices, incendiary munitions, or incendiary bombs 
> are weapons designed to start fires. 
> 
> They may destroy structures or sensitive equipment using fire, 
> and sometimes operate as anti-personnel weaponry. 
> 
> Incendiaries utilize materials such as napalm, thermite, magnesium powder, 
> chlorine trifluoride, or white phosphorus. 
> 
> Though colloquially often called "bombs", they are not explosives 
> but in fact operate to slow the process of chemical reactions 
> and use ignition rather than detonation to start or maintain the reaction. 
> 
> Napalm, for example, is petroleum especially thickened with certain chemicals into a gel 
> to slow, but not stop, combustion, releasing energy over a longer time than an explosive device. 
> In the case of napalm, the gel adheres to surfaces and resists suppression.
