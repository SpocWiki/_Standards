> The **Épée** (, French: [epe]; lit. 'sword'), also rendered as epee in English, 
> is the largest and heaviest of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. 
> The modern épée derives from the 19th-century épée de combat, 
> a weapon which itself derives from the French small sword.
>
> As a thrusting weapon, the épée is similar to a foil (contrasted with a sabre, which is designed for slashing). 
> It has a stiffer blade than a foil. It is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller. 
> The épée also has a larger bell guard designed to protect the user’s arm. 
> 
> In addition to the larger "bell" guard and blade, the épée weighs more than the foil and sabre 
> which contributes to its reputation of being the slowest form of fencing. 
> 
> The techniques of use differ, as there are no rules regarding priority and a lack of right of way. 
> Thus, immediate counterattacks are a common feature of épée fencing. 
> 
> The entire body is a valid target area.
