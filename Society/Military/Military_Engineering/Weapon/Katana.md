> A **Katana** (刀, かたな; lit. 'one-sided blade') is a Japanese sword 
> characterized by a curved, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard 
> and long grip to accommodate two hands. 
> 
> Developed later than the tachi, it was used by samurai in feudal Japan 
> and worn with the edge facing upward. 
> 
> Since the Muromachi period, many old tachi were cut from the root and shortened, 
> and the blade at the root was crushed and converted into a katana. 
> 
> The specific term for katana in Japan is uchigatana (打刀, うちがたな; lit. 'striking sword') 
> and the term katana (刀) often refers to single-edged swords from around the world.
