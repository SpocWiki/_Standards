## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Espionage**, spying, or intelligence gathering, as a subfield of the intelligence field, 
> is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information (intelligence). 
> 
> A person who commits espionage on a mission-specific contract is called an espionage agent or spy. 
> A person who commits espionage as a fully employed officer of a government is called an intelligence officer. 
> Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), 
> in the service of a government, company, criminal organization, or independent operation, 
> can commit espionage. 
> 
> The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. 
> In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law.
>
> Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. 
> However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. 
> Spying involving corporations is known as corporate espionage.
>
> One way to gather data and information about a targeted organization is by infiltrating its ranks. 
> Spies can then return information such as the size and strength of enemy forces. 
> They can also find dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or to defect. 
> 
> In times of crisis, spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. 
> Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. 
> Almost all sovereign states have strict laws concerning espionage, 
> including those who practice espionage in other countries, and the penalties for being caught are often severe.
