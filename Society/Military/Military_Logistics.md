## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Military logistics is the discipline of planning and carrying out the movement, supply, 
> and maintenance of military forces. 
> 
> In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with:
> - Design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of materiel.
> - Transport of personnel.
> - Acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation and disposition of facilities.
> - Acquisition or furnishing of services.
> - Medical and health service support.
>
> Logistics is an enabler of military operations, not an end in itself. (necessary, not sufficient)
> Poor logistics can result in defeat, but even the best logistics cannot guarantee victory. 
> Conversely, the best possible logistics is not always required: fit for purpose can suffice.
