## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Fighter aircraft (early on also pursuit aircraft) are military aircraft 
> designed primarily for air-to-air combat. 
> 
> In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. 
> Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft 
> to engage in tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, 
> and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same.
>
> The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower 
> but also its high speed and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. 
> 
> The success of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including 
> - the skill of its pilots, 
> - the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, 
> - and the numbers and performance of those fighters.
>
> Many modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack 
> and some types, such as fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. 
> 
> Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, 
> and these include the interceptor and, historically, the heavy fighter and night fighter.
