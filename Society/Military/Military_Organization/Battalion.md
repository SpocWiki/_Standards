> A **Battalion** is a military unit, typically consisting of up to one thousand soldiers. 
> A battalion is commanded by a lieutenant colonel and subdivided into several companies, 
> each typically commanded by a major or a captain. 
> 
> The typical battalion is built from three operational companies, 
> one weapons company and one headquarters company. 
> 
> In some countries, battalions are exclusively infantry, 
> while in others battalions are unit-level organizations. 
> 
> The word battalion has its origins in the Late Latin word battalion, 
> which is derived from battalia, meaning "battle" or "combat." 
> The term was used to describe a large group of soldiers ready for battle. 
> Over time, its meaning evolved in military terminology.
>
> The word "battalion" came into the English language in the 16th century 
> from the French bataillon, meaning "battle squadron" 
> (similar to the Italian battaglione meaning the same thing) 
> and the Spanish batallón, derived from the Vulgar Latin noun battalia ("battle") 
> and ultimately from the Classical Latin verb battuere ("to beat" or "to strike"). 
> 
> The first use of the word in English is attested in the 1580s.
