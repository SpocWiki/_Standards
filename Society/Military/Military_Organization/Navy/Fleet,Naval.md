# [[Fleet,Naval]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Naval fleet** is the largest operational formation of warships in a navy, 
> typically under a single command and organized for strategic missions. 
> 
> While modern fleets are permanent, multi-role forces (e.g., carrier strike groups), 
> historical fleets were often ad hoc assemblies for specific campaigns. 
> The term "fleet" can also synonymously refer to a nation’s entire navy, 
> particularly in smaller maritime forces.
>
> Fleets have shaped geopolitics since antiquity—
> from the trireme fleets of Athens to the nuclear-powered carrier groups of today—
> enabling power projection, trade protection, and deterrence. 
> 
> Multinational fleets, such as NATO’s Standing Maritime Groups, 
> demonstrate their continued diplomatic-military role.
