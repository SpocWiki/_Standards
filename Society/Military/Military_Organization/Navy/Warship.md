> A **Warship** or combatant ship is a naval ship that is used for naval warfare. 
> Usually they belong to the navy branch of the armed forces of a nation, 
> though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations. 
> 
> As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage 
> and are typically faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. 
> Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, 
> a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew.
>
> In wartime, the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often blurred.  
> Until the 17th century it was common for merchant ships to be pressed into naval service, 
> and not unusual for more than half of a fleet to be composed of merchant ships—
> there was not a large difference in construction, 
> unlike the difference between a heavily armoured battleship and an ocean liner. 
> 
> Until the threat of piracy subsided in the 19th century, 
> it was **normal practice to arm larger merchant ships** such as galleons. 
> 
> Warships have also often been used as troop carriers or supply ships, 
> such as by the French Navy in the 18th century 
> or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. 
> 
> In war since the early 20th century, merchant ships were often armed 
> and used as auxiliary warships, such as the Q-ships of the First World War 
> and the armed merchant cruisers of the Second World War.
