> A ship of the line was a type of naval warship constructed 
> during the Age of Sail from the 17th century to the mid-19th century. 
> 
> The ship of the line was designed for the naval tactic known as the line of battle, 
> which involved the two columns of opposing warships manoeuvering 
> to volley fire with the cannons along their broadsides. 
> 
> In conflicts where opposing ships were both able to fire from their broadsides, 
> the faction with more cannons firing – and therefore more firepower – 
> typically had an advantage.
>
> From the end of the 1840s, the introduction of steam power 
> brought less dependence on the wind in battle 
> and led to the construction of screw-driven wooden-hulled ships of the line; 
> a number of purely sail-powered ships were converted to this propulsion mechanism. 
> 
> However, the rise of the ironclad frigate, starting in 1859, 
> made steam-assisted ships of the line obsolete. 
> 
> The ironclad warship was predecessor to the 20th-century battleship, 
> whose very designation is itself a contraction of the phrase "ship of the line of battle" 
> or, more colloquially, "battleship of the line".
>
> The term "ship of the line" fell into disuse except in historical contexts, after warships and naval tactics evolved and changed from the mid-19th century. Some other languages did keep the name however; the Imperial German Navy called its battleships Linienschiffe until World War I.
