> The **Dreadnought** was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. 
> The first of the kind, the Royal Navy's HMS Dreadnought, had such an effect when launched in 1906 
> that similar battleships built after her were referred to as "dreadnoughts", 
> and earlier battleships became known as pre-dreadnoughts. 
> 
> Her design had two revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, 
> with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and steam turbine propulsion. 
> As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national power, 
> the arrival of these new warships renewed the naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. 
> 
> Dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, 
> lasting up to the beginning of World War I. 
> 
> Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of 
> improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. 
> 
> Within five years, new battleships outclassed Dreadnought herself. 
> These more powerful vessels were known as "super-dreadnoughts". 
> 
> Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I 
> under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, 
> but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued serving throughout World War II.
>
> Dreadnought-building consumed vast resources in the early 20th century, 
> but there was only one battle between large dreadnought fleets. 
> 
> At the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the British and German navies clashed with no decisive result. 
> The term dreadnought gradually dropped from use after World War I, 
> especially after the Washington Naval Treaty, 
> as virtually all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; 
> it can also be used to describe battlecruisers, 
> the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.
