> Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540 – 28 January 1596) was an English explorer and privateer 
> best known for making the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition 
> between 1577 and 1580 (being the first English expedition to accomplish this). 
> He is also known for participating in the early English slaving voyages 
> of his cousin, John Hawkins, and John Lovell. 
> 
> Having started as a simple seaman, 
> in 1588 he was part of the fight against the Spanish Armada as a vice admiral. 
>
> At an early age, Drake was placed into the household of a relative, William Hawkins, 
> a prominent sea captain in Plymouth. 
> In 1572, he set sail on his first independent mission, privateering along the Spanish Main. 
> Drake's circumnavigation began on 15 December 1577. 
> He crossed the Pacific Ocean, until then an area of exclusive Spanish interest, 
> and laid claim to New Albion, plundering coastal towns and ships for treasure and supplies as he went. 
> He arrived back in England on 26 September 1580. 
> Elizabeth I awarded Drake a knighthood in 1581 which he received aboard his galleon the Golden Hind.
>
> Drake's circumnavigation inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish 
> and in 1585, the Anglo-Spanish War began. 
> Drake was in command of an expedition to the Americas that attacked Spanish shipping and ports. 
> When Philip II sent the Spanish Armada to England in 1588 as a precursor to its invasion, 
> Drake was second-in-command of the English fleet that fought against and repulsed the Spanish fleet. 
> A year later he led the English Armada in a failed attempt to destroy the remaining Spanish fleet.
>
> Drake was a Member of Parliament (MP) for three constituencies: 
> - Camelford in 1581, 
> - Bossiney in 1584, and 
> - Plymouth in 1593. 
> Drake's exploits made him a hero to the English, 
> but his privateering led the Spanish to brand him a pirate, 
> known to them as El Draque ("The Dragon" in old Spanish). 
> He died of dysentery after his failed assault on Panama in January 1596.
