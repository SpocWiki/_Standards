> A **Letter of marque** and reprisal was a government license in the Age of Sail 
> that authorized a private person, known as a privateer or corsair, 
> to attack and capture vessels of a foreign state at war with the issuer, 
> licensing international military operations against a specified enemy 
> as reprisal for a previous attack or injury. 
> 
> Captured naval prizes were judged before the government's admiralty court 
> for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. 
>
> A common practice among Europeans from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century, 
> cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling 
> that combined patriotism and profit. 
> 
> Such legally authorized privateering contrasted with unlicensed captures of random ships, 
> known as piracy, which was universally condemned. 
> In practice, the differences between privateers and pirates were sometimes slight, 
> even merely a matter of interpretation.
>
> The terms "letter of marque" and "privateer" were sometimes 
> used to describe the ships which typically operated under the marque-and-reprisal licences. 
> In this context, a letter of marque was a lumbering, square-rigged cargo carrier 
> that might pick up a prize if the opportunity arose in its normal commerce. 
> In contrast, the term privateer generally referred to a fighting vessel, fore-and-aft rigged, fast, and weatherly.
>
> Letters of marque allowed governments to fight their wars using mercenary private captains and sailors 
> in place of their own navies as a measure to save time and money. 
> Instead of building, funding, and maintaining a navy in times of peace, 
> governments would wait until the start of a war to issue letters of marque to privateers, 
> who financed their own ships in expectation of prize money.
