> A **Brigade** is a major tactical military formation  
> that typically comprises three to six battalions plus supporting elements. 
> It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment. 
> Two or more brigades may constitute a division.
>
> In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit.
>
> Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored 
> (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades). 
> 
> In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, 
> such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units. 
> 
> Historically, such brigades have been called brigade-groups. 
> On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements 
> and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task.
>
> Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example 
> cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic. 
> 
> Some brigades are classified as independent or separate 
> and operate independently from the traditional division structure. 
> 
> The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 5,000 troops. 
> However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could start as high as 10,000 troops. 
> The Soviet Union as well as its forerunners and successors 
> have mostly used "regiment" instead of brigade, 
> and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II.
>
> A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel. 
> In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer. 
> 
> The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff. 
> The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff. 
> 
> Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major' 
> and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff. 
> 
> Some brigades may also have a deputy commander. 
> The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) 
> that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade. 
> 
> On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached. 
> The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit.
