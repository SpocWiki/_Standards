> The **Geneva Conventions** is a term used to collectively refer to 
> the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 
> along with their two optional protocols (Additional Protocols I and II), 
> which form the core of international humanitarian law 
> and establish international legal standards for the treatment of non-combatants in war. 
> 
> Negotiated in the aftermath of the World War II, 
> the Geneva Conventions of 1949 consist of four agreements, 
> which replaced three earlier humanitarian conventions of 1906 and 1929 
> and added two new conventions. 
> - The First Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of **sick and wounded field soldiers**, 
> - Second Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of **sick and wounded sailors**, 
> - Third Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of **prisoners of war**, and 
> - Fourth Geneva Convention addresses the treatment of **civilians** during armed conflict.
>
> Aside from the UN Charter, 
> the Geneva Conventions are among the most widely ratified international agreements. 
> 
> The 1949 conventions were ratified, in their entirety or with reservations, by 196 countries. 
> Much of the international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Conventions 
> has become customary international law, 
> and therefore would apply to all states and non-state armed groups, 
> even those that are not a party to the Geneva Conventions. 
> 
> The legal obligations created under the Geneva Conventions are somewhat 
> **different from other international treaties** 
> in that a breach of the Geneva Conventions by one party 
> does not furnish a directly affected party with the option to cease complying with its treaty obligations.
>
> The Geneva Conventions define the basic rights and protections afforded to 
> those non-combatants who fulfill the criteria of being protected persons. 
> 
> The Geneva Conventions concern only protected non-combatants in war. 
> The Geneva Conventions define the rights of civilians, prisoners of war, and military personnel; establish protections for the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked; 
> and provide humanitarian protections for civilians in and around war zones. 
> 
> The use of conventional weapons in wartime is addressed by the 
> Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the 
> 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, 
> while the use of **biological and chemical weapons** in international armed conflicts 
> is addressed by the 1925 Geneva Protocol.
>
> Violations of these earlier conventions constituted 
> some of the grounds for the judgments of the Nuremberg, Tokyo, and other war crimes tribunals. 
> 
> For grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, 
> states are obligated to establish and exercise universal jurisdiction. 
> 
> All four of the 1949 Geneva Conventions — in Articles 49, 50, 129, and 146 (respectively) — 
> all contain provisions obligating parties to search for alleged violators, 
> regardless of their nationality or place of offense, 
> and to either try violators before their own courts 
> or to hand them over to another party for trial. 
> 
> This principle of universal jurisdiction is rooted in the belief that 
> grave breaches of the Geneva Convention are such serious crimes 
> that all states have an obligation to bring those responsible to justice.
