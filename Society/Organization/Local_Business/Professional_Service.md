#is_a_/professional_service

Original definition: "provider of professional services."

The general [[ProfessionalService]] type for local businesses was deprecated due to confusion with [[Service]]. For reference, the types that it included were: [[dentist]],
		[[AccountingService]], [[legal_service/attorney]], [[legal_service/notary]], as well as types for several kinds of [[HomeAndConstructionBusiness]]: [[home_and_construction_business/electrician]], [[GeneralContractor]],
		[[HousePainter]], [[home_and_construction_business/locksmith]], [[home_and_construction_business/plumber]], [[RoofingContractor]]. [[LegalService]] was introduced as a more inclusive supertype of [[legal_service/attorney]].
