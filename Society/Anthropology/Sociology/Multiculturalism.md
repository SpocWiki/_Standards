> **Multiculturalism** is the coexistence of multiple cultures. 
> 
> The word is used in sociology, in political philosophy, and colloquially. 
> In sociology and everyday usage, it is usually a synonym for ethnic or cultural pluralism 
> in which various ethnic and cultural groups exist in a single society. 
> 
> It can describe a mixed ethnic community area 
> where multiple cultural traditions exist in a single country. 
> Groups associated with an indigenous, aboriginal or autochthonous ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.
>
> In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale, this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world.
>
> In reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as a state's capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely. It has been described as a "salad bowl" and as a "cultural mosaic", in contrast to a "melting pot".
