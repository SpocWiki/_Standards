## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Patriarchy** is a social system in which positions of authority are primarily held by men. 
> The term patriarchy is used both in anthropology 
> to describe a family or clan controlled by the father or eldest male or group of males, 
> and in feminist theory to describe a broader social structure in which men as a group dominate society.
>
> Sociobiologists compare human gender roles to sexed behavior in other primates 
> and argue that gender inequality originates from genetic and reproductive differences between men and women. Patriarchal ideology explains and rationalizes patriarchy by attributing gender inequality to inherent natural differences between men and women, divine commandment, or other fixed structures. Social constructionists among sociologists tend to disagree with biological explanations of patriarchy and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing gender roles. They further argue that gender roles and gender inequity are instruments of power and have become social norms to maintain control over women.
>
> Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures. Most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal, unless the criteria of complete exclusion of women in authority is applied.
