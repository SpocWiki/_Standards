> **Dalit** (English:  from Sanskrit: दलित meaning "broken/scattered") 
> is a term used for untouchables and outcasts, 
> who represented the lowest stratum of the castes in the Indian subcontinent. 
> They are also called Harijans. 
> 
> Dalits were excluded from the fourfold varna of the caste hierarchy 
> and were seen as forming a fifth varna, also known by the name of Panchama.
>
> Several scholars have drawn parallels between Dalits and the Burakumin of Japan, 
> the Baekjeong of Korea and the peasant class of the medieval European feudal system. 
>
> Dalits predominantly follow Hinduism with significant populations 
> following Buddhism, Sikhism, Christianity, and Islam. 
> 
> The constitution of India includes Dalits as one of the Scheduled Castes; 
> this gives Dalits the right to protection, Affirmative action (known as reservation in India), 
> and official development resources.
