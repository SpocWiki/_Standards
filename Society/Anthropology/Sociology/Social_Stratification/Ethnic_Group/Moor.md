> The term Moor is an exonym used in European languages 
> to designate primarily the Muslim populations of North Africa (the Maghreb) 
> and the Iberian Peninsula (particularly al-Andalus) during the Middle Ages. 
>
> **Moors** are not a single, distinct or self-defined people. 
> Europeans of the Middle Ages and the early modern period 
> variously applied the name to Arabs, Berbers, Muslim Europeans, and black peoples. 
> 
> The term has been used in a broad sense to refer to Muslims in general, 
> especially those of Arab or Berber descent, whether living in al-Andalus or North Africa. 
> 
> Related terms such as English "Blackamoor" 
> were also used to refer to black Africans generally in the early modern period. 
> 
> The 1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica observed that the term "Moors" had "no real ethnological value." 
> The word has racial connotations and it has fallen out of fashion among scholars since the mid-20th century.
>
> The word is also used when denoting various other specific ethnic groups in western Africa 
> and some parts of Asia. During the colonial era, the Portuguese introduced the names "Ceylon Moors" and "Indian Moors" in South Asia and Sri Lanka, now official ethnic designations on the island nation, and the Bengali Muslims were also called Moors. In the Philippines, the longstanding Muslim community, which predates the arrival of the Spanish, now self-identifies as the "Moro people", an exonym introduced by Spanish colonizers due to their Muslim faith. In modern-day Mauritania, the terms "Black moors" and "white Moors" are used to refer to the Haratin and Beidane peoples, respectively.
