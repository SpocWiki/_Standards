## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The working class is a group of people in a social hierarchy, 
> typically defined by earning wages or salaries through their ability to work. 
> 
> Members of the working class rely primarily upon earnings from wage labour. 
> 
> Most common definitions of "working class" in use in the United States 
> limit its membership to workers who hold blue-collar and pink-collar jobs, 
> or whose income is insufficiently high to place them in the middle class, or both. 
> 
> However, socialists define "working class" to include all workers 
> who require income from wage labour to subsist; thus, 
> this definition can include almost all of the working population of industrialized economies.
