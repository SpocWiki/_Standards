## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An ethnicity or ethnic group is a group of people who identify with each other 
> on the basis of perceived shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. 
> 
> Attributes that ethnicities believe to share include 
> - language, 
> - culture, 
> - ancestry, 
> - traditions, 
> - society, 
> - religion, 
> - history or social treatment. 
> 
> Ethnicities are maintained through long-term endogamy 
> and may have a narrow or broad spectrum of genetic ancestry, 
> with some groups having mixed genetic ancestry. 
> 
> Ethnicity is sometimes used interchangeably with nation, particularly in cases of ethnic nationalism. It is also used interchangeably with race although not all ethnicities identify as racial groups. 
>
> By way of assimilation, acculturation, amalgamation, language shift, intermarriage, adoption and religious conversion, individuals or groups may over time shift from one ethnic group to another. Ethnic groups may be divided into subgroups or tribes, which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to endogamy or physical isolation from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a panethnicity and may eventually merge into one single ethnicity. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as ethnogenesis.
>
> Two theories exist in understanding ethnicities, mainly primordialism and constructivism. Early 20th-century primordialists viewed ethnic groups as real phenomena whose distinct characteristics have endured since the distant past. Perspectives that developed after the 1960s increasingly viewed ethnic groups as social constructs, with identity assigned by societal rules.
