## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Indo-Scythians**, also known as Indo-Sakas, were a group of nomadic people 
> of Iranic Scythian origin who migrated from Central Asia southward 
> into the present-day regions of 
> - Afghanistan, 
> - Eastern Iran and 
> - the northwestern Indian subcontinent: present-day Pakistan and northern India. 
> The migrations persisted from the middle of the second century BCE to the fourth century CE.
>
> The first Saka king in India was Maues/Moga (first century BCE) 
> who established Saka power in Gandhara, the Indus Valley, and other regions. 
> 
> The Indo-Scythians extended their supremacy over the north-western subcontinent, 
> conquering the Indo-Greeks and other local peoples. 
> 
> They were apparently subjugated by the Kushan Empire's Kujula Kadphises or Kanishka. 
> The Saka continued to govern as satrapies, 
> forming the Northern Satraps and Western Satraps. 
> 
> The power of the Saka rulers began to decline during the 2nd century CE 
> after the Indo-Scythians were defeated by the Satavahana emperor Gautamiputra Satakarni. 
> 
> Indo-Scythian rule in the northwestern subcontinent ended 
> when the last Western Satrap, Rudrasimha III, was defeated 
> by the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II in 395 CE.
>
> The invasion of the northern Indian subcontinent by Scythian tribes from Central Asia, 
> often referred to as the Indo-Scythian invasion, 
> played a significant role in the history of the subcontinent and nearby regions. 
> The Indo-Scythian war was triggered by the nomadic flight of Central Asians 
> from conflict with tribes such as the Xiongnu in the second century CE, 
> which had lasting effects on Bactria, Kabul and the Indian subcontinent 
> and Rome and Parthia in the west. 
> 
> Ancient Roman historians, including Arrian and Claudius Ptolemy, 
> have mentioned that the ancient Sakas ("Sakai") were nomadic people. 
> The first rulers of the Indo-Scythian kingdom were Maues (c. 85–60 BCE) and Vonones (c. 75–65 BCE).
