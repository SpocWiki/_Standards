> The **Visigoths** (Latin: Visigothi, Wisigothi, Vesi, Visi, Wesi, Wisi) 
> were a Gothic people who emerged in the Balkans during late antiquity. 
> 
> Likely descended from the Thervingi who entered the Roman Empire in 376 
> and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople (378), 
> they were first united under Alaric I (395–410), 
> whose forces alternately fought and allied with Rome 
> before famously sacking the city in 410.
>
> In 418, the Visigoths were settled as foederati in southern Gaul, 
> establishing a kingdom with its capital at Toulouse. 
> 
> From there they expanded into Hispania, displacing the Suebi and Vandals. 
> Defeat by the Franks under Clovis I at the Battle of Vouillé (507) 
> ended Visigothic rule in Gaul, 
> but the kingdom consolidated in Spain and Portugal, 
> where it endured for two centuries.
>
> The Visigoths are remembered for their cultural and religious transformation of Iberia. 
> 
> Under King Reccared I, 
> they converted from Arian to Nicene Christianity at the Third Council of Toledo (589), 
> integrating with their Hispano-Roman subjects and strengthening royal legitimacy. 
> 
> Their Visigothic Code (654) abolished legal distinctions between Goths and Romans, 
> creating a common identity as Hispani. 
> 
> The kingdom fostered churches 
> and artistic treasures such as the Treasure of Guarrazar, 
> and its legal code remained influential in Iberian law until the Late Middle Ages.
>
> In 711, the Visigothic kingdom collapsed after 
> defeat by an Umayyad army at the Battle of Guadalete, where King Roderic was killed. 
> 
> In the north, the Kingdom of Asturias soon emerged under Pelagius, 
> marking the beginning of the Reconquista. 
> 
> Despite their fall, the Visigoths left a lasting legacy through their legal system, 
> cultural influence, and role in the formation of medieval Iberia.
