> The **Ostrogoths** (Latin: Ostrogothi, Austrogothi) were a Roman-era Germanic people 
> who in the 5th and 6th centuries established one of the two major Gothic kingdoms 
> within the Western Roman Empire. 
> 
> They drew on large Gothic populations settled in the Balkans since the 4th century 
> and rose to prominence under Theodoric the Great, 
> who in 493 founded the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy after defeating Odoacer.
>
> Theodoric belonged to the Amal dynasty, which had gained power in Pannonia 
> after the collapse of Attila’s Hunnic empire. 
> 
> Backed by the Byzantine emperor Zeno, Theodoric invaded Italy 
> and established his rule from Ravenna, preserving Roman administration, law, 
> and culture while governing Goths and Romans under parallel systems. 
> His reign marked the height of Ostrogothic power and stability in Italy.
>
> After Theodoric’s death in 526, dynastic instability weakened the kingdom. 
> In 535, Emperor Justinian I launched the Gothic War (535–554), 
> aiming to restore imperial authority in the West. 
> 
> The Ostrogoths, revitalized under Totila, temporarily regained much of Italy, 
> but Totila was killed at the Battle of Taginae in 552. 
> The protracted war devastated the peninsula, 
> and the Ostrogothic state collapsed by 554. 
> Survivors were absorbed into the Lombards, 
> who established their own kingdom in Italy by 568.
>
> The Ostrogoths were associated with the earlier Greuthungi mentioned by Roman authors such as Ammianus Marcellinus, and later identified by the historian Jordanes with the realm of Ermanaric in the 4th century. Ancient sources often referred to them simply as “Goths,” but modern scholarship distinguishes them as one of the two main branches of the Gothic peoples, alongside the Visigoths.
