> The **Tocharians** or Tokharians (US:  toh-KAIR-ee-ən, -⁠KAR-; UK:  to-KAR-ee-ən) 
> were speakers of the Tocharian languages, a group of Indo-European languages 
> known from around 7,600 documents from the 6th and 7th centuries, 
> found on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (modern-day Xinjiang, China). 
> 
> The name "Tocharian" was given to these languages in the early 20th century 
> by scholars who identified their speakers with a people 
> known in ancient Greek sources as the Tókharoi (Latin: Tochari), 
> who inhabited Bactria from the 2nd century BC. 
> 
> This identification is now generally considered erroneous, 
> but the name "Tocharian" remains the most common term for the languages and their speakers. 
> 
> Their endonym is unknown, although they may have referred to themselves 
> as the Agni, Kuči, and Krorän or as the Agniya and Kuchiya known from Sanskrit texts.
>
> Agricultural communities first appeared in the oases of the northern Tarim circa 2000 BC, 
> represented by the earliest Tarim mummies. 
> 
> Genetic analysis reveals that nearly all (11 of 12, ~92%) of the early Tarim males 
> carried R1a1a-M198, with additional individuals carrying R1b1b, 
> establishing them within the paternal lineages of Ancient North Eurasian (ANE, ~72%) ancestry. 
> 
> However, the early Tarim mummies were not direct ancestors of the later-attested Tocharians. 
> Instead, the Tocharian languages were likely introduced to the Tarim Basin later 
> by Afanasievo-related migrants from the central steppes 
> carrying the exact same paternal R-M17 during the Late Bronze Age (1600–1400 BCE).
>
> By the 2nd century BC, these settlements had developed into city-states, 
> overshadowed by nomadic peoples to the north and Chinese empires to the east. 
> These cities, the largest of which was Kucha, also served as way stations 
> on the branch of the Silk Road that ran along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert.
>
> For several centuries, the Tarim basin was ruled by the Xiongnu, 
> the Han dynasty, the Tibetan Empire, and the Tang dynasty. 
> 
> From the 8th century AD, the Uyghurs – speakers of a Turkic language – settled in the region 
> and founded the Kingdom of Qocho that ruled the Tarim Basin. 
> 
> The peoples of the Tarim city-states intermixed with the Uyghurs, 
> whose Old Uyghur language spread through the region. 
> 
> The Tocharian languages are believed to have become extinct during the 9th century.
