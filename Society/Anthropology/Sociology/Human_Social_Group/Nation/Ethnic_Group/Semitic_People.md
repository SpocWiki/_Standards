## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Semitic people or Semites is a term for an ethnic, cultural or racial group 
> associated with people of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, 
> including Akkadians (Assyrians and Babylonians), Arabs, Arameans, Canaanites 
> (Ammonites, Edomites, Israelites, Moabites, Phoenicians, and Philistines) 
> and Habesha peoples. 
> 
> The terminology is now largely unused 
> outside the grouping "Semitic languages" in linguistics. 
> 
> First used in the 1770s by members of the Göttingen school of history, 
> this biblical terminology for race was derived from Shem (שֵׁם), 
> one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis, 
> together with the parallel terms Hamites and Japhetites.
>
> In archaeology, the term is sometimes used informally as 
> "a kind of shorthand" for ancient Semitic-speaking peoples. 
> 
> Identification of pro-Caucasian racism has either partially or completely devalued 
> the use of the term as a racial category, with the caveat that an inverse assessment would still be considered scientifically obsolete.
