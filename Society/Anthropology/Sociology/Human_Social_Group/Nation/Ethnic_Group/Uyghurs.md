## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Uyghurs**, alternatively spelled Uighurs, Uygurs or Uigurs, 
> are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with 
> the general region of Central Asia and East Asia. 
> 
> The Uyghurs are recognized as the titular nationality 
> of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. 
> They are one of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities.
>
> The Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a **series of oases** scattered 
> across the Taklamakan Desert within the Tarim Basin. 
> 
> These oases historically functioned as independent states 
> or came under the control of various civilizations, including 
> Chinese, Mongol, Tibetan, and Turkic powers. 
> 
> The Uyghurs gradually started to become Islamized in the 10th century, 
> and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the 16th century. 
> Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity.
>
> An estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin. 
> The rest of Xinjiang's Uyghurs mostly live in Yining (Ghulja), Karamay, Tacheng (Chöchek) and Ürümqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, which is located in the historical region of Dzungaria. The largest community of Uyghurs living outside of Xinjiang are the Taoyuan Uyghurs of north-central Hunan's Taoyuan County. Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in other Turkic countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey. Smaller communities live in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Australia, Japan, Canada, Russia, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States.
>
> Since 2014, the Chinese government has been accused by various governments and organizations, such as Human Rights Watch of subjecting Uyghurs living in Xinjiang to widespread persecution, including forced sterilization and forced labor. Scholars estimate that at least one million Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang internment camps since 2017; Chinese government officials claim that these camps, created under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's administration, serve the goals of ensuring adherence to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology, preventing separatism, fighting terrorism, and providing vocational training to Uyghurs. Various scholars, human rights organizations and governments consider abuses perpetrated against the Uyghurs to amount to crimes against humanity and genocide.
