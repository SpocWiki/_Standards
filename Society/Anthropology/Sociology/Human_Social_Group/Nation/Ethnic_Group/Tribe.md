## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The term **Tribe** is used in many different contexts to refer to a category of human social group. 
> The predominant worldwide use of the term in English is in the discipline of anthropology. 
> 
> The definition is contested, in part due to 
> conflicting theoretical understandings of social and kinship structures, 
> and also reflecting the problematic application of this concept to 
> extremely diverse human societies. 
> 
> Its concept is often contrasted by anthropologists with other social and kinship groups, 
> being hierarchically larger than a lineage or clan, 
> but smaller than a chiefdom, ethnicity, nation or state. 
> These terms are similarly disputed. 
> 
> In some cases tribes have legal recognition 
> and some degree of political autonomy  from national or federal government, 
> but this legalistic usage of the term may conflict with anthropological definitions.
>
> In the United States (US), Native American tribes are legally considered to 
> have "domestic dependent nation" status within the territorial United States, 
> with a government-to-government relationship with the federal government.
