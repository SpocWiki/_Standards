## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Open society (French: société ouverte) is a term 
> coined by French-Jewish philosopher Henri Bergson in 1932, 
> and describes a dynamic system inclined to moral universalism. 
> 
> Bergson contrasted an open society with what he called a closed society, 
> a closed system of law, morality or religion. 
> 
> Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, 
> the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.
>
> The idea of an open society was further developed during World War II 
> by the Austrian-born Jewish philosopher Karl Popper. 
> Popper saw it as part of a historical continuum 
> - reaching from the organic, tribal, or closed society, 
> - through the open society (marked by a critical attitude to tradition) 
> - to the abstract or depersonalized society lacking all face-to-face interaction transactions.
