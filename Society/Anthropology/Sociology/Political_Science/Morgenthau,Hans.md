> Hans Joachim Morgenthau (February 17, 1904 – July 19, 1980) 
> was a German-American jurist and political scientist 
> who was one of the major 20th-century figures in the study of international relations. 
> 
> Morgenthau's works belong to the tradition of realism in international relations theory; 
> he is usually considered among the most influential realists of the post-World War II period. 
> 
> Morgenthau made landmark contributions to international relations theory 
> and the study of international law. 
> His Politics Among Nations, first published in 1948, 
> went through five editions during his lifetime 
> and was widely adopted as a textbook in U.S. universities. 
> 
> While Morgenthau emphasized the centrality of power and "the national interest," 
> the subtitle of Politics Among Nations—"the struggle for power and peace"—
> indicates his concern not only with the struggle for power 
> but also with the ways in which it is limited by ethical and legal norms.
>
> In addition to his books, Morgenthau wrote widely about international politics 
> and U.S. foreign policy for general-circulation publications such as The New Leader, 
> Commentary, Worldview, The New York Review of Books and The New Republic. 
> 
> He knew and corresponded with many of the leading intellectuals and writers of his era, 
> such as Reinhold Niebuhr, George F. Kennan, Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt. 
> 
> At one point in the early Cold War, 
> Morgenthau was a consultant to the U.S. Department of State 
> when Kennan headed its Policy Planning Staff, 
> as well as a second time during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations 
> until he was dismissed by Johnson 
> when he began to publicly criticize American policy in Vietnam. 
> 
> For most of his career, however, 
> Morgenthau was esteemed as an academic interpreter of U.S. foreign policy.
