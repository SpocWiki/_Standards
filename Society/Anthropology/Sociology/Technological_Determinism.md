## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Technological determinism is a reductionist theory in assuming that 
> a society's technology progresses by following its own internal logic of efficiency, 
> while determining the development of the social structure and cultural values. 
> 
> The term is believed to have originated from Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), 
> an American sociologist and economist. 
> 
> The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century 
> was most likely Clarence Ayres who was a follower of Thorstein Veblen as well as John Dewey. 
> 
> William Ogburn was also known for his radical technological determinism 
> and his theory on cultural lag.
