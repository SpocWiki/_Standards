## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Science studies  is an interdisciplinary research area 
> that seeks to situate scientific expertise in broad social, historical, and philosophical contexts. 
> 
> It uses various methods to analyze the production, representation and reception of scientific knowledge and its epistemic and semiotic role.
>
> Similarly to cultural studies, science studies are defined by the subject of their research and encompass a large range of different theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. The interdisciplinary approach may include and borrow methods from the humanities, natural and formal sciences, from scientometrics to ethnomethodology or cognitive science. 
>
> Science studies have a certain importance for evaluation and science policy. Overlapping with the field of science, technology and society, practitioners study the relationship between science and technology, and the interaction of expert and lay knowledge in the public realm.
