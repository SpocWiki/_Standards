> Cultural anthropology is a branch of anthropology 
> focused on the study of cultural variation among humans. 
> 
> It is in contrast to social anthropology, 
> which perceives cultural variation as a subset of a posited anthropological constant. 
> The term sociocultural anthropology includes both cultural and social anthropology traditions.
>
> Anthropologists have pointed out that through culture, 
> people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, 
> so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. 
> 
> Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of 
> and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) 
> and the global (a universal human nature, 
> or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances).
>
> Cultural anthropology has a rich methodology, 
> including participant observation (often called fieldwork because 
> it requires the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location), 
> interviews, and surveys.
