# [[Human_Nature]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Human nature comprises the fundamental dispositions and characteristics—
> including ways of thinking, feeling, and acting—that humans are said to have naturally. 
> 
> The term is often used to denote the essence of humankind, or what it 'means' to be human. 
> This usage has proven to be controversial in that 
> there is dispute as to whether or not such an essence actually exists.
>
> Arguments about human nature have been a central focus of philosophy for centuries 
> and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate. 
> 
> While both concepts are distinct from one another, 
> discussions regarding human nature are typically related to those regarding 
> the comparative importance of genes and environment in human development 
> (i.e., 'nature versus nurture'). 
> 
> Accordingly, the concept also continues to play a role in academic fields, 
> such as both the natural and the social sciences, 
> and philosophy, in which various theorists claim to have yielded insight into human nature. 
> 
> Human nature is traditionally contrasted with human attributes that vary among societies, 
> such as those associated with specific cultures.
>
> The concept of nature as a standard by which to make judgments 
> is traditionally said to have begun in Greek philosophy, 
> at least in regard to its heavy influence on Western and Middle Eastern languages and perspectives. 
> 
> By late antiquity and medieval times, the particular approach that came to be dominant was that of Aristotle's teleology, 
> whereby human nature was believed to exist somehow independently of individuals, 
> causing humans to simply become what they become. 
> 
> This, in turn, has been understood as also demonstrating 
> a special connection between human nature and divinity, 
> whereby human nature is understood in terms of final and formal causes. 
> 
> More specifically, this perspective believes that nature itself (or a nature-creating divinity) 
> has intentions and goals, including the goal for humanity to live naturally. 
> Such understandings of human nature see this nature as an "idea", or "form" of a human. However, the existence of this invariable and metaphysical human nature 
> is subject of much historical debate, continuing into modern times.
>
> Against Aristotle's notion of a fixed human nature, 
> the relative malleability of man has been argued especially strongly in recent centuries—
> firstly by early modernists such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. 
> In his Emile, or On Education, Rousseau wrote: 
> "We do not know what our nature permits us to be." 
> 
> Since the early 19th century, such thinkers as Darwin, Freud, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, 
> and Sartre, as well as structuralists and postmodernists more generally, 
> have also sometimes argued against a fixed or innate human nature.
>
> Charles Darwin's theory of evolution has particularly changed the shape of the discussion, 
> supporting the proposition that the ancestors of modern humans were not like humans today. 
> 
> As in much of modern science, 
> such theories seek to explain with little or no recourse to metaphysical causation. 
> They can be offered to explain the origins of human nature and its underlying mechanisms, 
> or to demonstrate capacities for change and diversity 
> which would arguably violate the concept of a fixed human nature.
