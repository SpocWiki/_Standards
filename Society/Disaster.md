## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Disaster** is an event that causes serious harm to people, buildings, economies, 
> or the environment, and the affected community cannot handle it alone. 
> 
> Natural disasters like avalanches, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires are caused by natural hazards. 
> Human-made disasters like oil spills, terrorist attacks and power outages are caused by people. 
> Nowadays, it is hard to separate natural and human-made disasters 
> because human actions can make natural disasters worse. 
> Climate change also affects how often disasters due to extreme weather hazards happen.
>
> Disasters usually hit people in developing countries harder than people in wealthy countries. 
> Over 95% of deaths from disasters happen in low-income countries, 
> and those countries lose a lot more money compared to richer countries. 
> For example, the damage from natural disasters 
> is 20 times greater in developing countries than in industrialized countries. 
> This is because low-income countries often do not have well-built buildings 
> or good plans to handle emergencies.
>
> To reduce the damage from disasters, it is important to be prepared and have fit for purpose infrastructure. 
> Disaster risk reduction (DRR) aims to make communities stronger and better prepared to handle disasters. 
> It focuses on actions to reduce risk before a disaster occurs, rather than on response and recovery after the event. DRR and climate change adaptation measures are similar in that 
> they aim to reduce vulnerability of people and places to natural hazards.
>
> When a disaster happens, the response includes actions like warning and evacuating people, 
> rescuing those in danger, and quickly providing food, shelter, and medical care. 
> The goal is to save lives and help people recover as quickly as possible. 
> 
> In some cases, national or international help may be needed to support recovery. 
> This can happen, for example, through the work of humanitarian organizations.
