> A **Tithe** (from Old English: teogoþa "tenth") is a one-tenth part of something, 
> paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. 
> 
> Modern tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques or via online giving, 
> whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural produce. 
> 
> Church tax linked to the tax system are used in many countries to support their national church.  
> Donations to the church beyond what is owed in the tithe, 
> or by those attending a congregation who are not members or adherents, are known as offerings, 
> and often are designated for specific purposes such as a building program, debt retirement, or mission work.
>
> Many Christian denominations hold Jesus taught that tithing must be done in conjunction 
> with a deep concern for "justice, mercy and faithfulness" (cf. Matthew 23:23). 
> 
> Tithing was taught at early Christian church councils, including the Council of Tours in 567, 
> as well as the Third Council of Mâcon in 585. 
> 
> Tithing remains an important doctrine in many Christian denominations, 
> such as the Congregational churches, Methodist Churches and Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
> 
> Some Christian Churches, such as those in the Methodist tradition, teach the concept of Storehouse Tithing, 
> which emphasizes that tithes must be prioritized and given to the local church, 
> before offerings can be made to apostolates or charities.
>
> Traditional Jewish law and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. 
> Orthodox Jews commonly practice ma'aser kesafim (tithing 10% of their income to charity). 
> 
> In modern Israel, some religious Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, 
> e.g., ma'aser rishon, terumat ma'aser, and ma'aser sheni.
