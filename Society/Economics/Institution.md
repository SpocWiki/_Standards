## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Institution** is a humanly devised 
> structure of rules and norms that shape and constrain social behavior. 
> 
> All definitions of institutions generally entail that there is a __level of persistence and continuity__. 
> Laws, rules, social conventions and norms are all examples of institutions. 
> Institutions vary in their level of formality and informality.
>
> Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as 
> political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described 
> by [[Durkheim,Ã‰mile]] as the "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning"). 
> 
> Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family or money that are broad enough to encompass sets of related institutions. Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement. Historians study and document the founding, growth, decay and development of institutions as part of political, economic and cultural history.
