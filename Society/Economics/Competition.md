## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Competition** is a rivalry where two or more parties strive 
> for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss 
> (an example of which is a zero-sum game). 
>
> Competition can arise between entities eg organisms, individuals, economic, social groups, etc. 
> The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition.
>
> Competition occurs in nature, between living 
> organisms which co-exist in the same environment. 
> Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources. 
>
> Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met 
> deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame 
> when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment. 
> 
> Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, 
> often associated with business competition among companies.
> Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting 
> and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.
>
> Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation; 
> however, in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm. 
> In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued 
> "the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system. 
> The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players". 
> Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of 
> mathematics known as [[Game_Theory]].
>
> Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. 
> Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition. 
> They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. 
> They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. 
> Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. 
> Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. 
> They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, 
> and how competition has developed over time.
