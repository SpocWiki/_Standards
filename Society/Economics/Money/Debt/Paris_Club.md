> Paris Club (French: Club de Paris) is a group of major creditor countries 
> aiming to provide a sustainable way to tackle debt problems in debtor countries. 
> 
> Its creation, which is the first informal meeting, dates back to 1956, 
> when Argentina agreed to hold a meeting with its public creditors.
>
> The Paris Club treats public claims (that is to say, those 
> due by governments of debtor countries and by the private sector), 
> guaranteed by the public sector to Paris Club members. 
> 
> A similar process used to occur for public debt held by private creditors 
> in the London Club, which was organized in 1970 on the model of the Paris Club 
> as an informal group of commercial banks renegotiating together 
> the debt they hold on sovereign debtors (countries to which they extended loans) 
> which were no longer able to repay.
>
> Creditor countries meet ca. ten times a year for Tour d'Horizon and negotiating sessions. 
> To facilitate Paris Club operations, the French Treasury provides a small secretariat, 
> and the Director general of the French Treasury acts as chairman.
>
> Paris club has reached 478 agreements with 102 debtor countries to date 
> for approximately USD 600 bn rescheduled.
