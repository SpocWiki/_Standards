> In finance and economics, 
> **Interest** is payment from a debtor or deposit-taking financial institution 
> to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum 
> (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. 
> 
> It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay to the lender or some third party. 
> It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) 
> from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, 
> rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained 
> by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.
>
> For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, 
> so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; 
> or a customer may earn interest on their savings, 
> and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. 
> In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, 
> and the bank plays the role of the borrower.
>
> Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, 
> whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. 
> (Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, 
> but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.)
>
> The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period 
> divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage).
>
> Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest 
> in addition to the principal. 
> 
> Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, 
> and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. 
> 
> In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, 
> and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.
