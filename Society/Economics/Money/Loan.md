> In finance, a **Loan** is the tender of money by one party to another with an agreement to pay it back. 
> 
> The recipient, or borrower, incurs a debt and is usually required to pay interest for the use of the money.
>
> The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) 
> will normally specify, among other things, 
> - the principal amount of money borrowed, 
> - the interest rate the lender is charging, and 
> - the date of repayment. 
> A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.
>
> The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. 
> In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, 
> which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. 
> Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent.
>
> Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions 
> such as banks and credit card companies. 
> 
> For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.
