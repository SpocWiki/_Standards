> **creative destruction** (German: schöpferische Zerstörung) is a concept in economics 
> that describes a process in which new innovations 
> replace and make obsolete older innovations.
>
> The concept is usually identified with the economist Joseph Schumpeter, 
> who derived it from the work of Karl Marx 
> and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle. 
> 
> It is also sometimes known as Schumpeter's gale. 
> In Marxian economic theory, the concept refers more broadly to 
> the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism.
>
> The German sociologist Werner Sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms 
> in his work Krieg und Kapitalismus (War and Capitalism, 1913). 
> 
> In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation 
> (Vernichtung) 
> implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, 
> but also that it must continuously devalue existing wealth 
> (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) 
> in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.
>
> In Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), 
> Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx's thought. 
> 
> In contrast with Marx – who argued that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system – 
> Schumpeter reinforced the evolutionary nature of capitalist economies, 
> downplaying the concerns of static competition analysis (i.e., market concentration), 
> and reinforcing the importance of dynamic competition analysis (i.e., threat of entry, 
> new technologies and means of production, competition in dimensions different than price). 
> 
> In his words, "This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. 
> It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in [...] 
> 
> The problem that is usually being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures, 
> whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them. As long as this is not recognized, the investigator does a meaningless job. As soon as it is recognized, his outlook on capitalist practice and its social results changes considerably". Despite this, the term subsequently gained popularity within mainstream economics as a description of processes such as downsizing to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company. The Marxian usage has, however, been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, Manuel Castells and Daniele Archibugi.

> In modern economics, creative destruction is one of the central concepts in the endogenous growth theory. 
>
> In Why Nations Fail, a popular book on long-term economic development, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue the major reason countries stagnate and go into decline is the willingness of the ruling elites to block creative destruction, a beneficial process that promotes innovation.
