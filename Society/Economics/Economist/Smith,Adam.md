> Adam Smith  (baptised 16 June  [O.S. 5 June] 1723 – 17 July 1790) 
> was a Scottish economist and philosopher 
> who was a pioneer in the thinking of political economy 
> and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. 
> 
> Seen by some as "The Father of Economics" or "The Father of Capitalism", 
> he wrote two classic works, The [[../../../../Knowledge/Economy/Theory_of_Moral_Sentiments]] (1759) 
> and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the [[Wealth_of_Nations]] (1776). 
> 
> The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, 
> is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work 
> that treats economics as a comprehensive system and as an academic discipline. 
> 
> Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God's will 
> and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental 
> and technological factors and the interactions among them. 
> Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith's idea of absolute advantage.
>
> Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, 
> where he was one of the first students to 
> benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. 
> 
> After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures 
> at the University of Edinburgh, 
> leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. 
> 
> Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, 
> wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. 
> In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, 
> where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.
>
> As a __reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants__ 
> through minimizing imports and maximizing exports, what came to be known as [[../../../Society/Ideology/Economic_Ideology/Mercantilism]], 
> Smith laid the foundations of classical [[free market economy]] theory. 
> 
> The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. 
> In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon 
> how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. 
> 
> Smith was controversial in his own day 
> and his general approach and writing style 
> were often satirized by writers such as Horace Walpole.
