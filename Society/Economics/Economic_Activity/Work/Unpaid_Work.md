> Unpaid labor or **Unpaid work** is defined as 
> labor or work that does not receive any direct remuneration. 
> 
> This is a form of non-market work which can fall into one of two categories: 
> 1. unpaid work that is placed within the production boundary of the System of National Accounts (SNA), 
>    such as gross domestic product (GDP); and 
> 2. unpaid work that falls outside of the production boundary (non-SNA work), 
>    such as domestic labor that occurs inside households for their consumption. 
> 
> Unpaid labor is visible in many forms and is not limited to activities within a household. 
> 
> Other types of unpaid labor activities include volunteering as a form of charity work 
> and interning as a form of unpaid employment. 
> 
> In a lot of countries, unpaid domestic work in the household is typically performed by women, 
> due to gender inequality and gender norms, which can result in high-stress levels in 
> women attempting to balance unpaid work and paid employment. 
> 
> In poorer countries, this work is sometimes performed by children.
