## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Trans-Saharan trade** is trade between sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa 
> that requires travel across the Sahara. 
> 
> Though this trade began in prehistoric times, 
> the peak of trade extended from the 8th century until the early 17th century CE. 
> 
> The Sahara once had a different climate and environment. 
> In Libya and Algeria, from at least 7000 BCE, pastoralism (the herding of sheep and goats), 
> large settlements and pottery were present. 
> 
> Cattle were introduced to the Central Sahara (Ahaggar) between 4000 and 3500 BCE. 
> Remarkable rock paintings (dated 3500 to 2500 BCE) in arid regions 
> portray flora and fauna that are not present in the modern desert.
>
> As a desert, the Sahara is now a hostile expanse 
> that separates the Mediterranean economy from the economy of the Niger River Basin. 
> 
> As Fernand Braudel points out, crossing such a zone, especially without mechanized transport, 
> is worthwhile only when exceptional circumstances cause 
> the expected gain to outweigh the cost and the danger. 
> 
> Trade was conducted by caravans of camels. 
> According to Maghrebi explorer Ibn Battuta, who once traveled with a caravan, 
> an average one would amount to 1,000 camels, but some caravans were as large as 12,000. 
> 
> The caravans were guided by highly-paid Berbers, who knew the desert 
> and could ensure protection from fellow desert nomads. 
> 
> The caravans' survival relied on careful coordination: 
> runners would be sent ahead to oases for water to be shipped out to the caravan 
> when it was still several days away, as the caravans could usually not carry enough 
> to make the full journey. 
> 
> In the mid-14th century CE, Ibn Battuta crossed the desert from Sijilmasa 
> via the salt mines at Taghaza to the oasis of Oualata. 
> A guide was sent ahead, and water was brought over a four-day journey from Oualata 
> to meet the caravan.
>
> Culture and religion were also exchanged on the trans-Saharan trade routes. 
> Many West African states eventually adopted Arabic writing and the religion of North Africa, 
> resulting in these states' absorption into the Muslim world.
