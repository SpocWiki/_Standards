> **Standard Oil** Company was a corporate trust in the petroleum industry that existed from 1882 to 1911. 
> 
> The origins of the trust lay in the operations of the Standard Oil Company (Ohio), 
> which had been founded in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller. 
> 
> The trust was born on January 2, 1882, when a group of 41 investors signed the Standard Oil Trust Agreement, 
> which pooled their securities of 40 companies into a single holding agency managed by nine trustees. 
> The original trust was valued at $70 million. 
> 
> On March 21, 1892, the Standard Oil Trust was dissolved 
> and its holdings were reorganized into 20 independent companies that formed an unofficial union 
> referred to as "Standard Oil Interests." 
> In 1899, the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) acquired the shares of the other 19 companies 
> and became the holding company for the trust.
>
> Jersey Standard operated a near monopoly in the American oil industry from 1899 until 1911 
> and was the largest corporation in the United States. 
> 
> In 1911, the landmark Supreme Court case Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States 
> found Jersey Standard guilty of anticompetitive practices and ordered it to break up its holdings. 
> 
> The charge against Jersey came about in part as a consequence of the reporting of Ida Tarbell, 
> who wrote The History of the Standard Oil Company. 
> The net value of companies severed from Jersey Standard in 1911 was $375 million, 
> which constituted 57 per cent of Jersey's value. 
> After the dissolution, 
> Jersey Standard became the United States' second largest corporation after United States Steel.
>
> The Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), which was renamed Exxon in 1973 and [[Exxon_Mobil]] in 1999, 
> remains one of the largest public oil companies in the world. 
> 
> Many of the companies disassociated from Jersey Standard in 1911 
> remained powerful businesses through the twentieth century. 
> 
> These included the 
> - Standard Oil Company of New York, 
> - Standard Oil Company (Indiana), 
> - Standard Oil Company (California), 
> - Ohio Oil Company, 
> - Continental Oil Company, and 
> - Atlantic Refining Company.
