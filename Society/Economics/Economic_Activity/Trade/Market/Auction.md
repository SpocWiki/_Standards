Auctions create the winner's curse: 
The Price paid is the highest and therefore typically above the average price. 

For prestigious goods, Auctions pay off for the seller.
They are good for the buyer only when the goods are superfluous, 
so you have a business to re-work the goods for higher value e.g. home renovation.
