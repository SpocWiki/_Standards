## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In the field of management, strategic management involves 
> the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives 
> taken by an organization's  managers on behalf of stakeholders, 
> based on consideration of resources and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization operates. 
> 
> Strategic management provides overall direction to an enterprise 
> and involves specifying the organization's objectives, 
> developing policies and plans to achieve those objectives, 
> and then allocating resources to implement the plans. 
> 
> Academics and practicing managers have developed numerous models and frameworks to assist in strategic decision-making in the context of complex environments and competitive dynamics. Strategic management is not static in nature; the models can include a feedback loop to monitor execution and to inform the next round of planning.
>
> Michael Porter identifies three principles underlying strategy:
> - creating a "unique and valuable [market] position"
> - making trade-offs by choosing "what not to do"
> - creating "fit" by aligning company activities with one another to support the chosen strategy.
>
> Corporate strategy involves answering a key question from a portfolio perspective: "What business should we be in?" Business strategy involves answering the question: "How shall we compete in this business?" Alternatively, corporate strategy may be thought of as the strategic management of a corporation (a particular legal structure of a business), and business strategy as the strategic management of a business.
>
> Management theory and practice often make a distinction between strategic management and operational management, where operational management is concerned primarily with improving efficiency and controlling costs within the boundaries set by the organization's strategy.
