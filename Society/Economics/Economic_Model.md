> An economic model is a theoretical construct representing economic processes 
> by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. 
> 
> The economic model is a simplified, often mathematical, framework 
> designed to illustrate complex processes. 
> 
> Frequently, economic models posit structural parameters. 
> A model may have various exogenous variables, 
> and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. 
> Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.
