> Economics is a social science that studies the 
> production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
>
> Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. 
> 
> Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies, 
> including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. 
> 
> Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. 
> Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production, distribution, consumption, savings, and investment expenditure interact; and the factors of production affecting them, such as: labour, capital, land, and enterprise, inflation, economic growth, and public policies that impact these elements. 
> It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy.
>
> Other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, 
> describing "what is", and normative economics, advocating "what ought to be"; 
> between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.
>
> Economic analysis can be applied throughout society, including business, finance, cybersecurity, health care, engineering and government. 
> 
> It is also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, feminism, law, philosophy, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.
