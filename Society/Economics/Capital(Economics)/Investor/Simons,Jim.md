> James Harris Simons (April 25, 1938 – May 10, 2024) 
> was an American hedge fund manager, investor, mathematician, and philanthropist. 
> 
> At the time of his death, Simons's net worth was estimated to be $31.4 billion, 
> making him the 55th-richest person in the world. 
> 
> He was the founder of Renaissance Technologies, 
> a quantitative hedge fund based in East Setauket, New York. 
> 
> He and his fund are known to be quantitative investors, 
> using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment gains from market inefficiencies. 
> 
> Due to the long-term aggregate investment returns of Renaissance and its Medallion Fund, 
> Simons was called the "greatest investor on Wall Street" 
> and more specifically "the most successful hedge fund manager of all time".
>
> Simons developed the Chern–Simons form (with Shiing-Shen Chern), 
> and contributed to the development of string theory 
> by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory.
>
> In 1994, Simons and his wife, Marilyn, founded the Simons Foundation 
> to support research in mathematics and fundamental sciences. 
> 
> The foundation is the top benefactor of Stony Brook University, Marilyn's alma mater, 
> and is a major contributor to his alma maters, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
> and the University of California, Berkeley. 
> 
> Simons was a member of the boards of the Stony Brook Foundation, the MIT Corporation, 
> and the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute in Berkeley, 
> and chaired the boards of Math for America, the Simons Foundation, and Renaissance Technologies. 
> 
> In 2023, the Simons Foundation gave $500 million to Stony Brook University, 
> the second-largest donation to a public university in U.S. history. 
> 
> In 2016, the International Astronomical Union named asteroid 6618 Jimsimons, 
> which Clyde Tombaugh discovered in 1936, after Simons 
> in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.
