> **Product lifetime** or product lifespan is the time interval from when a product is sold to when it is discarded.
>
> Product lifetime is slightly different from 
> service life which considers only the effective time the product is used. 
> It is also different from product economic life which refers to 
> the point where maintaining a product is more expensive than replacing it; 
> from product technical life which refers to the maximum period 
> during which a product has the physical capacity to function; 
> and from the functional life 
> which is the time a product should last regardless of external intervention to increase its lifespan.
>
> Product lifetime represent an important area of enquiry with regards to product design, 
> the circular economy and sustainable development. 
> 
> This is because products, with the materials involved in their design, production, distribution, use 
> and disposal (across their life cycle), embody carbon due to the energy involved in these processes. 
> 
> Therefore, if product lifetimes can be extended, the use of energy, embodied in carbon, can be reduced 
> and progress can be made towards __reducing greenhouse gas emissions__: 
> Bocken et al. term this "Slowing resource loops" (309, their emphasis). 
> In addition, excessive __waste generation__ has been attributed to short-lived goods and a throwaway society.
>
> In recent years, there has been a growth in academic and policy discussions around product lifetimes. 
> For example, discussion of product lifetimes are an integral part of 
> the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy. 
> 
> In academia, the PLATE (Product Lifetimes and the Environment) Consortium 
> hosts regular [conferences](http://www.plateconference.org/) and seminars around the topic of product lifetimes and the environment. 
> 
> In the business world, the Canadian Kijiji platform's Secondhand Economy Index 
> examines how consumers extend product lifetime through secondhand marketplaces, swapping, donating and renting/leasing/lending/pooling (see: https://www.kijiji.ca/kijijicentral/second-hand-economy/).
>
> This article examines how product lifetimes are defined in the academic literature and discusses how product lifetimes can be measured. A distinction is made between the definition and measurement of actual and expected product lifetimes.
