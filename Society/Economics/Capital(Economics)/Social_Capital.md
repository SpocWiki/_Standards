> Social capital is a concept used in sociology and economics 
> to define networks of relationships 
> which are productive towards advancing the goals of individuals and groups.
>
> It involves the effective functioning of social groups through 
> - interpersonal relationships, 
> - a shared sense of identity, 
> - a shared understanding, 
> - shared norms, 
> - shared values, 
> - trust, 
> - cooperation, 
> - and reciprocity. 
> 
> Some have described it as a form of capital that produces public goods for a common purpose, although this does not align with how it has been measured.
>
> Social capital has been used to explain the improved performance of diverse groups, the growth of entrepreneurial firms, superior managerial performance, enhanced supply chain relations, the value derived from strategic alliances, and the evolution of communities.
