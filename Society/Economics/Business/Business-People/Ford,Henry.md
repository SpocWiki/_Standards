> **Henry Ford** (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist and business magnate. 
> As the founder of the Ford Motor Company, 
> he is credited as a pioneer in making automobiles affordable for middle-class Americans 
> through the system that came to be known as Fordism. 
> In 1911, he was awarded a patent for the transmission mechanism 
> that would be used in the Ford Model T and other automobiles.  
>
> Ford was born in a farmhouse in Springwells Township, Michigan, 
> and left home at the age of 16 to find work in Detroit. 
> It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, 
> and throughout the later half of the 1880s, he began repairing and later constructing engines, 
> and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. 
> He founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903 after prior failures in business, 
> but success in constructing automobiles.
>
> The introduction of the Ford Model T automobile in 1908 is credited with having revolutionized both transportation and American industry. 
> As the sole owner of the Ford Motor Company, Ford became one of the wealthiest people in the world. 
> He was also among the pioneers of the five-day work-week. 
> Ford believed that consumerism could help to bring about world peace. 
> His commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, 
> including a franchise system, 
> which allowed for car dealerships throughout North America and in major cities on six continents.
>
> Ford was known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I, 
> although during the war his company became a major supplier of weapons. 
> 
> He promoted the League of Nations. 
> In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitism through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent 
> and the book The International Jew. 
> He opposed his country's entry into World War II, 
> and served for a time on the board of the America First Committee. 
> 
> After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company, 
> but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of several of his subordinates. 
> He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. 
> Upon his death in 1947, he left most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, 
> and control of the company to his family.
