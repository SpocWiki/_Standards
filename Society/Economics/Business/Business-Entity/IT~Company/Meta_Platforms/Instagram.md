> **Instagram** is an American photo and short-form video sharing social networking service 
> owned by Meta Platforms. 
> It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, 
> and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. 
> 
> Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. 
> Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, 
> and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed. 
> 
> A Meta-operated image-centric social media platform, it is available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, 
> and the web. 
> Users can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and other tools, 
> then share them on other social media platforms like Facebook. 
> It supports 32 languages including English, Hindi,  Spanish, French, Korean, and Japanese.
>
> Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square 
> (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. 
> 
> In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. 
> It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, 
> and a Stories featureâ€”similar to its main competitor, Snapchat, 
> which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, 
> with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. 
> As of January 2019, Stories was used by 500 million people daily.
>
> Instagram was launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. 
> It rapidly gained popularity, reaching 1 million registered users in two months, 
> 10 million in a year, and 1 billion in June 2018. 
> 
> In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. 
> The Android version of Instagram was released in April 2012, 
> followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, 
> a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. 
> 
> Although often admired for its success and influence, 
> Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, 
> its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, 
> and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.
