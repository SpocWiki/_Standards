> Threads  is a social media, microblogging service operated by Meta Platforms. 
> Threads requires an Instagram account to use the service and features integration between the two platforms. 
> Upon its launch, Threads became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, 
> gaining over 100 million users in its first five days and surpassing the record previously set by ChatGPT.
>
> After Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Meta employees explored the concept of introducing text-based functionality to Instagram. 
> This feature, known as Instagram Notes, was rolled out in December 2022. 
> The company subsequently began developing a separate app focused on text-based posts. 
> Development on Threads—internally known as "Project 92"—commenced in January 2023, with the platform officially launching on July 5, 2023. 
> Threads immediately became available in 100 countries, but until December 14, 2023 had delayed its launch in the European Union 
> as it waited for regulatory clarity from the European Commission regarding the service's data collection policies.
