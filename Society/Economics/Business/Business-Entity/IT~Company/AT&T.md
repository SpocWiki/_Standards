In 1880 the management of American Bell had created what would become **AT&T Long Lines**. 
The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. 
The project was formally incorporated in New York 
as a separate company named **American Telephone and Telegraph Company** on 1885-03-03. 

Originating in New York City, its long-distance telephone network reached [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), in 1892, 
with its multitudes of local exchanges continuing to stretch further and further yearly, 
eventually creating a continent-wide telephone system. 
On 1899-12-30, the assets of American Bell were transferred 
into its subsidiary American Telephone and Telegraph Company (formerly _AT&T Long Lines_); 
this was because [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts "Massachusetts") corporate laws were very restrictive, and limited capitalization to ten million dollars, 
forestalling American Bell's further growth. 
With this assets transfer at the very end of the 19th century, 
AT&T became the parent of both American Bell and the [Bell System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System "Bell System").
