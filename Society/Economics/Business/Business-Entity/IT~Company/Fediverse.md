> The **Fediverse** (commonly shortened to Fedi) is a __collection of social networking services__ 
> that can communicate with each other (formally known as federation) using a common protocol. 
> Users of different websites can send and receive status updates, multimedia files and other data across the network. 
> The term Fediverse is a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe".
>
> The majority of Fediverse platforms are free and open-source software, 
> and create connections between servers using the __ActivityPub protocol__. 
> 
> Some software still supports older federation protocols as well, 
> such as OStatus, the Diaspora protocol and Zot. 
> 
> Diaspora is the only actively developed software project 
> classified under the original definition of Fediverse that does not support ActivityPub.
