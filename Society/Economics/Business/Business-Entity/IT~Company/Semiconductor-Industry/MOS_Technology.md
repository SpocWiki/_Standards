1975 [[Peddle,Chuck]] was a Motorola Sales Agent, who realized that 
- [[Motorola~6800]] was 200$ per Processor 
  and could not be marketed to Engineers from other Companies 
- simpler Instruction-Sets could be produced much cheaper: 
  [[MOS6501]] Processor at 20$ and [[MOS6502]] at 25$ 
- In 1973 [[Texas_Instruments]] started to build their own Calculators 
  and put many Integrators out of the business by raising their Chip Prices. 
- [[MOS_Technology]] was producing Chips for Texas Instruments and Atari Pong. 
Atari was the first Company using the [[MOS6502]] in their Consoles. 
[[Steve_Jobs]] and [[Wozniak,Steve]] were also very interested. 

Unfortunately Motorola sued MOS for using their Socket Design, 
which cost MOS 1M$ in Layer Fees and 300k$ Damage. 
[[Commodore_Int]] was also affected by [[Texas_Instruments]]' Strategy 
and acquired [[MOS]] for a ridiculously low Price to produce Calculator Chips. 
[[Commodore_Int]] didn't intend to build a Computer, 
but [[Radioshack]] requested a Computer from Commodore, so they turned to [[../../../../../../../IT/HardWare/HW~Companies/Apple_Inc]] first. 
But Steve Jobs would not sell their company. (Eventually the [[Apple_II]] used a [[MOS6502]]. ) 
Commodore tried to spice up the Deal with Calculators, then Radioshack also turned them down. 
So Radioshack built their own Computer hosting a [[Zilog~Z80]]. 
1977-04-16 West Cost Computer Fair saw both the [[Apple_II]] and the [[Commodore_PET]]. 
The same year Atari brought out their [[Atari_2600]] Console also with a [[MOS6502]] .
