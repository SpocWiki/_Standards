> William Bradford Shockley Jr. (1910-02-13 â€“ 1989-08-12) 
> was an American inventor, physicist, and eugenicist. 
> 
> He was the manager of a research group at Bell Labs 
> that included [[Bardeen,John]] and [[Brattain,Walter]]. 
> 
> The three scientists were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics 
> for "their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect".
>
> Partly as a result of Shockley's attempts 
> to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s, 
> California's [[Silicon_Valley]] became a hotbed of electronics innovation. 
> He recruited brilliant employees, 
> but quickly alienated them with his autocratic and erratic management; 
> they left and founded major companies in the industry. 
>
> In his later life, while a professor of electrical engineering at [[../Acorn_Computers/Stanford_University]] 
> and afterward, Shockley became known as a racist and eugenicist.
