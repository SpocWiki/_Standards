In early 1952, Texas Instruments purchased a patent license 
to produce germanium [[Transistor]]s from [Western Electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric "Western Electric"), 
the manufacturing arm of AT&T, for US$25,000, 
beginning production by the end of the year. 

Haggerty brought [Gordon Teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Teal "Gordon Teal") to the company due to his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals while at [Bell Telephone Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Telephone_Laboratories "Bell Telephone Laboratories"). 
Teal's first assignment was to direct TI's research laboratory. 
At the end of 1952, Texas Instruments announced 
that it had expanded to 2,000 employees and $17 million in sales.

Among his new hires was [Willis Adcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Adcock "Willis Adcock"), who joined TI early in 1953. 
Adcock, who like Teal was a [physical chemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemist "Physical chemist"), began leading a small research group 
focused on the task of fabricating grown-junction, [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon"), single-crystal, 
small-signal transistors. Adcock later became the first TI Principal Fellow. 

[[Kilby,Jack]], an employee at TI, invented the [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") in 1958.
Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, 
and successfully demonstrated the world's first working integrated circuit on 1958-09-12.
Six months later, [Robert Noyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce "Robert Noyce") of [Fairchild Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor "Fairchild Semiconductor") 
(who went on to co-found [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel "Intel")) 
independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect, 
and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit.
Noyce's chip, made at Fairchild, was made of silicon, while Kilby's chip was made of [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium "Germanium").

The [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series "7400 series") of [[TTL(Transistor-Transistor_Logic)]] chips, 
developed by Texas Instruments in the 1960s, 
popularized the use of integrated circuits in computer logic.
