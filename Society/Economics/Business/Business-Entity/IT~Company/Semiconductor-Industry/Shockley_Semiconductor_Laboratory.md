> Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, later known as Shockley Transistor Corporation, 
> was a pioneering semiconductor developer founded by [[Shockley,William]], 
> and funded by [[Beckman_Instruments,Inc]]., in 1955.  
> 
> It was the first high technology company in what came to be known as Silicon Valley 
> to work on silicon-based semiconductor devices.
>
> In 1957, the "traitorous eight" leading scientists resigned 
> and became the core of what became [[Fairchild_Semiconductor]]. 
> Shockley Semiconductor never recovered from this departure, 
> and was purchased by Clevite in 1960, then sold to ITT in 1968, 
> and shortly after, officially closed.
>
> The building remained, but was repurposed as a retail store.  
> By 2015 plans were made to demolish the site to develop a new building complex.  
> By 2017 the site was redeveloped with new signage 
> marking it as the "Real Birthplace of Silicon Valley."
