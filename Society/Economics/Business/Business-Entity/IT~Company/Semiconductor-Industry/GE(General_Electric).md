During 1889, [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison "Thomas Edison") (1847–1931) 
had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including 
- Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in [East Newark, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Newark,_New_Jersey "East Newark, New Jersey"); 
- [Edison Machine Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Machine_Works "Edison Machine Works"), a manufacturer of [dynamos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo "Dynamo") and large [electric motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor "Electric motor") in [Schenectady, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenectady,_New_York "Schenectady, New York"); 
- Bergmann & Company, a manufacturer of electric [lighting fixtures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_fixture "Light fixture"), [sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbulb_socket "Lightbulb socket"), and other electric lighting devices; and 
- Edison Electric Light Company, the [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent")-holding company and financial arm for Edison's lighting experiments, backed by [J. P. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan "J. P. Morgan") (1837–1913) and the [[Vanderbilt_family]]. 

In 1889, [Drexel, Morgan & Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel,_Morgan_%26_Co. "Drexel, Morgan & Co."), 
a company founded by J.P. Morgan and [Anthony J. Drexel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_J._Drexel "Anthony J. Drexel") 
financed Edison's research and helped 
merge several of Edison's separate companies under one corporation 
forming [[Edison General Electric Company]], 
which was incorporated in New York on 1889-04-24 

The new company acquired [Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague_Electric_Railway_%26_Motor_Company "Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company") 
in the same year. 
The consolidation did not involve all of the companies established by Edison; 
notably, the [Edison Illuminating Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Illuminating_Company "Edison Illuminating Company"), 
which would later become [Consolidated Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Edison "Consolidated Edison"), was not part of the merger. 

In 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of [New Britain, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain,_Connecticut "New Britain, Connecticut"), 
which merged a few years later with [[Thomson-Houston_Electric_Company]], led by [Charles Coffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Coffin "Charles A. Coffin"). 
In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company. 

General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of 
- [[Edison General Electric Company]] and 
- [[Thomson-Houston_Electric_Company]] with the support of Drexel, Morgan & Co. 

The original plants of both companies 
continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.
