> **Motorola**, Inc. () was an American multinational telecommunications company 
> based in Schaumburg, Illinois. 
> 
> It was founded  in 1928 as Galvin Manufacturing Corporation 
> by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin. 
> 
> Paul Galvin wanted a brand name for their new car radio, 
> and created the name "Motorola" by linking "motor" (for motorcar) 
> with "ola" (from [Victrola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victrola "Victrola")), which was also a popular ending for many companies at the time, e.g. [Moviola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviola "Moviola"), [Crayola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayola "Crayola"). 
> The company sold its first Motorola branded radio on 1930-06-23 to Herbert C. Wall of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for $30. 
> The Motorola brand name became so well known 
> that Galvin Manufacturing Corporation later changed its name to Motorola, Inc., in 1947.
> 
> 1999 [Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola "Motorola")'s spun off it's Semiconductor Components Group headquartered in [[Phoenix,Arizona]] as [[onsemi]]. 
> 
> After having lost $4.3 billion from 2007 to 2009, 
> Motorola was split into two independent public companies, 
> [[Motorola Mobility]] and [[Motorola Solutions]], on 2011-01-04 
> 
> The reorganization was structured with 
> Motorola Solutions legally succeeding Motorola, Inc., 
> and Motorola Mobility being spun off. 
> 
> Motorola designed and sold wireless network equipment 
> such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers. 
> 
> Motorola's home and broadcast network products included set-top boxes, 
> digital video recorders, and network equipment used to enable video broadcasting, 
> computer telephony, and high-definition television. 
> 
> Its business and government customers 
> consisted mainly of wireless voice and broadband systems 
> (used to build private networks), and public safety communications systems 
> like Astro and Dimetra. 
> These businesses, except for set-top boxes and cable modems, 
> became part of Motorola Solutions.
>
> Motorola's wireless telephone handset division was a pioneer in cellular telephones. 
> Also known as the Personal Communication Sector (PCS) prior to 2004, 
> it pioneered the "mobile phone" with the first truly mobile "brick phone" DynaTAC, 
> "flip phone" with the MicroTAC as well as the "clam phone" 
> with the StarTAC in the mid-1990s. 
> 
> It had staged a resurgence by the mid-2000s with the RAZR, 
> but lost market share in the second half of that decade. 
> 
> Later it focused on smartphones 
> using Google's open-source Android mobile operating system. 
> 
> The first phone to use Android 2.0 "Eclair", the Motorola Droid, was released in 2009 
> (the GSM version launched a month later, in Europe, as the Motorola Milestone). 
> The handset division, along with the cable set-top box and modem businesses, 
> were later spun off into [[Motorola Mobility]].

In 1969, [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong "Neil Armstrong") spoke the famous words "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" from the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon") on a Motorola transceiver.

In 1973, Motorola demonstrated the first hand-held portable telephone.

In 1974, Motorola introduced its first microprocessor, the 8-bit [MC6800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC6800 "MC6800"), 
used in automotive, computing and video game applications.

The 6800 was the basis for the more popular [MOS Technology 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502 "MOS Technology 6502"), 
which was made by former Motorola employees. 
That same year, Motorola sold its television business to the Japan-based Matsushita â€“ 
the parent company of [Panasonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic "Panasonic").

In 1980, Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the [MC68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC68000 "MC68000"), 
led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, 
powering devices from companies such as [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc."), [Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International "Commodore International"), [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Corp. "Atari Corp."), [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems "Sun Microsystems"), 
and [Hewlett-Packard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard "Hewlett-Packard").

[Dr. Martin Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_(inventor) "Martin Cooper (inventor)") of Motorola made the first private handheld mobile phone call 
on a larger prototype model in 1973.

In September 1983, the U.S. [Federal Communications Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") (FCC) approved 
the [DynaTAC 8000X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynaTAC_8000X "DynaTAC 8000X") telephone, the world's first commercial cellular device. 
By 1998, cellphones accounted for two thirds of Motorola's gross revenue.

In June 2000, Motorola and [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco "Cisco") supplied the world's first commercial [GPRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS "GPRS") cellular network to [BT Cellnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Cellnet "BT Cellnet") in the United Kingdom. Motorola also developed the world's first GPRS cell phone.
