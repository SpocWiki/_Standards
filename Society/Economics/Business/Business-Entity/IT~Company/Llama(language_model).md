> Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI, formerly stylized as LLaMA) 
> is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) 
> released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. 
> The latest version is Llama 3.2, released in September 2024.
>
> Model weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community 
> under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. 
> Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. 
> In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests 
> against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. 
> 
> Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia 
> and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. 
> 
> Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. 
> Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. 
> Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started 
> releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.
>
> Alongside the release of Llama 3, 
> Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, 
> and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.
