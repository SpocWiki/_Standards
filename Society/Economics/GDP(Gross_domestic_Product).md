## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of 
> the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered 
> in a specific time period by a country or countries. 
> 
> GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region. 
> The major components of GDP are consumption, government spending, 
> net exports (exports minus imports), and investment. 
> Changing any of these factors can increase the size of the economy. 
> 
> For example, population growth through mass immigration 
> can raise consumption and demand for public services, thereby contributing to GDP growth. 
> However, GDP is not a measure of overall standard of living or well-being, 
> as it does not account for how income is distributed among the population. 
> 
> A country may rank high in GDP but still experience jobless growth 
> depending on its planned economic structure and strategies. 
> Dividing total GDP by the population gives an idealized rough measure of GDP per capita. 
> Several national and international economic organizations, 
> such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, maintain their own definitions of GDP.
>
> GDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons 
> as well as a broad measure of economic progress. 
> It serves as a statistical indicator of national development and progress. 
> Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. 
> Nominal GDP is useful 
> when comparing national economies on the international market using current exchange rate. 
> To compare economies over time inflation can be adjusted 
> by comparing real instead of nominal values. 
> For cross-country comparisons, GDP figures are often adjusted 
> for differences in the cost of living using [[PPP(Purchasing_Power_Parity)]] (PPP). 
> GDP per capita at purchasing power parity 
> can be useful for comparing living standards between nations. 
>
> GDP has been criticized for leaving out key externalities, 
> such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. 
> Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, 
> such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index, 
> as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.
