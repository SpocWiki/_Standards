Initially proposed by [[Economist/Smith,Adam|Adam Smith]], who argued that 
assigning specialized tasks to different workers increases total output 
by enhancing dexterity, saving time, and fostering innovation.
This marked the switch from craftsman to (un-)skilled Worker 
and from Workshop to Manufacturing and Factories and eventually Assembly Lines. 
The concrete example was making needles. 

## Theory of Comparative Advantage 
[[Economist/Ricardo,David]]'s Theory of Comparative Advantage in addition proves that, 
Specialization and international Trade is always beneficial, 
even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. 

## Comparison with Heckscher–Ohlin Theory

| Aspect           | **Comparative Advantage (Ricardo)**                      | **Heckscher–Ohlin Theory**                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basis            | Differences in **opportunity cost** (labor productivity) | Differences in **factor endowments** (labor, capital)            |
| Main Assumption  | __Labor__ is the only production factor                  | Multiple factors: labor, __capital__, __land__                   |
| Trade Prediction | Countries specialize based on **relative productivity**  | Countries export goods that use **abundant factors intensively** |
| Empirical Fit    | Strong for simple models and historical trade flows      | Better for modern, complex economies with diverse inputs         |
| Developed by     | [[Economist/Ricardo,David\|David Ricardo]] (1817)                                     | Eli Heckscher (1919), Bertil Ohlin (1933)                        |
