## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of economic thought is the study of the philosophies of the different thinkers 
> and theories in the subjects that later became political economy and economics, 
> from the ancient world to the present day.
>
> This field encompasses many disparate schools of economic thought. 
> Ancient Greek writers such as the philosopher Aristotle 
> examined ideas about the art of wealth acquisition, 
> and questioned whether property is best left in private or public hands. 
> 
> In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas argued that 
> it was a moral obligation of businesses to sell goods at a just price.
>
> In the Western world, economics was not a separate discipline, 
> but part of philosophy until the 18th–19th century Industrial Revolution 
> and the 19th century Great Divergence, which accelerated economic growth.
