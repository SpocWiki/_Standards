> **Infrastructure** is the set of facilities and systems that serve a country, city, or other area, 
> and encompasses the services and facilities 
> necessary for its economy, households and firms to function. 
> 
> Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical structures 
> such as roads, railways, bridges, airports, public transit systems, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access). 
> 
> In general, infrastructure has been defined as 
> "the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services 
> essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions" 
> and maintain the surrounding environment.
>
> Especially in light of the massive societal transformations needed 
> to mitigate and adapt to climate change, 
> contemporary infrastructure conversations frequently focus on sustainable development 
> and green infrastructure. 
> 
> Acknowledging this importance, the international community has created policy 
> focused on sustainable infrastructure through the Sustainable Development Goals, 
> especially Sustainable Development Goal 9 "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure".
>
> One way to describe different types of infrastructure is to classify them as two distinct kinds: 
> hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. 
> 
> Hard infrastructure is the physical networks necessary 
> for the functioning of a modern industrial society or industry. 
> 
> This includes roads, bridges, and railways. 
> 
> Soft infrastructure is all the institutions that maintain 
> the economic, health, social, environmental, and cultural standards of a country. 
> This includes educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, 
> law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.
