> A **Meal** is an occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes consumption of food. 
> 
> The English names used for specific meals vary, 
> depending on the speaker's culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. 
> A meal is different from a snack in that meals are generally larger, more varied, and more filling.
>
> Though they can be eaten anywhere, meals usually take place in homes, restaurants, and cafeterias. 
> Regular meals occur on a daily basis, typically several times a day. 
> Special meals are normally held in conjunction with celebratory or momentous occasions 
> such as birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, funerals, and holidays.
>
> The type of food that is served or consumed at any given time depends on regional customs. 
> Three main meals are typically eaten in the morning, early afternoon, and evening in most civilizations. 
> 
> Furthermore, the names of meals are often interchangeable by custom as well. 
> Some serve dinner as the main meal at midday, with supper as the late afternoon/early evening meal, 
> while others may call their midday meal lunch and their early evening meal supper or dinner. 
> 
> Except for breakfast, these names can vary from region to region or even from family to family.
