## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Food storage** is a way of decreasing the variability of the food supply 
> in the face of natural, inevitable variability. 
> 
> It allows food to be eaten for some time (typically weeks to months) after harvest 
> rather than solely immediately. 
> 
> It is both a traditional domestic skill (mainly as root cellaring) and, 
> in the form of food logistics, an important industrial and commercial activity. 
> 
> Food preservation, storage, and transport, including timely delivery to consumers, 
> are important to food security, especially for the majority of people 
> throughout the world who rely on others to produce their food. 
>
> Significant losses of food are caused by inadequate storage conditions 
> as well as decisions made at earlier stages of the supply chain, 
> which predispose products to a shorter shelf life. 
> 
> Adequate cold storage, in particular, can be crucial 
> to prevent quantitative and qualitative food losses.
>
> Food is stored by almost every human society and by many animals. 
> Storing of food has several main purposes:
> - Preventing foodborne illness from consuming decomposing food
> - Reducing food waste by preserving unused or uneaten food for later use
> - Storage of harvested and processed plant and animal food products for distribution to consumers
> - Enabling a better balanced diet throughout the year
> - Preserving pantry food, such as spices or dry ingredients like rice and flour, for eventual use in cooking
> - Preparedness for catastrophes, emergencies and periods of food scarcity or famine, 
>   whether as basic emergency preparedness (for most people) 
>   or in its more extreme form of survivalism (prepping)
> - Religious reasons: for example, leaders in the LDS Church 
>   (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) instruct church members to store food. 
> - Protection from animals or theft
