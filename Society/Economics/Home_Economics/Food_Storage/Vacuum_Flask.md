> A vacuum flask (also known as a Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or thermos)
> is an insulating storage vessel that slows the speed at which its contents change in temperature.  
> 
> It greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler 
> than the flask's surroundings by trying to be as adiabatic as possible. 
> 
> Invented by James Dewar in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two flasks, 
> placed one within the other and joined at the neck. 
> The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, 
> creating a near-vacuum which significantly reduces heat transfer by conduction or convection. 
> When used to hold cold liquids, 
> this also virtually eliminates condensation on the outside of the flask.
>
> Vacuum flasks are used domestically to keep contents inside 
> hot or cold for extended periods of time. 
> 
> They are also used for thermal cooking. 
> Vacuum flasks are also used for many purposes in industry.
