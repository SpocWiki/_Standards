## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dinner** usually refers to what is in many Western cultures the biggest and most formal meal of the day. 
> Historically, the largest meal used to be eaten around midday, and called dinner. 
> 
> Especially among the elite, it gradually migrated to later in the day over the 16th to 19th centuries. 
> The word has different meanings depending on culture, 
> and may mean a meal of any size eaten at any time of day. 
> 
> In particular, it is still sometimes used for a meal at noon or in the early afternoon on special occasions, 
> such as a Christmas dinner. 
> 
> In hot climates, the main meal is more likely to be eaten in the evening, after the temperature has fallen.
