> In cutlery or kitchenware, a **Fork** (from Latin: furca 'pitchfork') is a utensil, now usually made of metal, 
> whose long handle terminates in a head that branches into several narrow and often slightly curved tines 
> with which one can spear foods either to hold them to cut with a knife or to lift them to the mouth.
