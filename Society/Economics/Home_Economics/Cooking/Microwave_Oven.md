## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A microwave oven, or simply microwave, is an electric oven that heats and cooks food 
> by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. 
> This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy (heat) 
> in a process known as dielectric heating. 
> 
> Microwave ovens heat food quickly and efficiently 
> because the heating effect is fairly uniform in the outer 25–38 mm (1–1.5 inches) 
> of a homogeneous, high-water-content food item.
>
> The development of the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom 
> made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength 
> (microwaves) to efficiently heat up water molecules. 
> 
> American electrical engineer Percy Spencer is generally credited 
> with developing and patenting the world's first commercial microwave oven, the "Radarange", 
> which was first sold in 1947. 
> He based it on British radar technology which had been developed before and during World War II.
>
> Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven 
> that was introduced by Tappan in 1955, 
> but it was still too large and expensive for general home use. 
> 
> Sharp Corporation introduced the first microwave oven with a turntable between 1964 and 1966. 
> The countertop microwave oven was introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation. 
> After microwave ovens became affordable for residential use in the late 1970s, 
> their use spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world, 
> and prices fell rapidly during the 1980s. 
> 
> In addition to cooking food, microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.
>
> Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance 
> and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. 
> 
> They rapidly heat foods which can easily burn or turn lumpy if cooked in conventional pans, 
> such as butter, fats, chocolate, or porridge. 
> Microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, 
> since they rarely attain the necessary temperature to produce Maillard reactions. 
> Exceptions occur in cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other oily items 
> (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.
>
> Microwave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking, 
> because the boiling-range temperatures of a microwave oven 
> do not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying, browning, 
> or baking at a higher temperature produces. 
> 
> However, there are hybrid appliances that combine infrared radiation, hot air, and microwaves, such as convection microwave ovens.
