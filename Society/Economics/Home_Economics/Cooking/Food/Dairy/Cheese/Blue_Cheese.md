## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Blue cheese is any cheese made with the addition of cultures of edible molds, 
> which create blue-green spots or veins through the cheese. 
> 
> Blue cheeses vary in flavor from mild to strong and from slightly sweet to salty or sharp; 
> in colour from pale to dark; and in consistency from liquid to hard. 
> They may have a distinctive smell, either from the mold 
> or from various specially cultivated bacteria such as Brevibacterium linens.
>
> Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, 
> and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. 
> Blue cheeses are typically aged in temperature-controlled environments.
