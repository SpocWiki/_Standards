> before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, 
> though also considered to be native to Indian Subcontinent (particularly Northern India) and Afghanistan.
>
> It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century 
> and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. 
> 
> It is widely cultivated throughout West Asia and the Caucasus region, South Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. 
> The fruit is typically in season in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February, 
> and in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May.
