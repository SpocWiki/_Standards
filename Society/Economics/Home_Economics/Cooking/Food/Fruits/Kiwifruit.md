> **Kiwifruit** (often shortened to kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry 
> (獼猴桃 in Traditional Chinese and 猕猴桃 in Simplified Chinese), 
> is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus [[Actinidia]]. 
> 
> The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa 'Hayward') 
> is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: 5–8 centimetres (2–3 inches) in length 
> and 4.5–5.5 cm (1+3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) in diameter. 
> 
> Kiwifruit has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, light brown skin that is tart but edible, 
> and light green or golden flesh that contains rows of tiny black edible seeds. 
> The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.
>
> Kiwifruit is native to central and eastern China, with the first recorded description dating back to the 12th century during the Song dynasty. In the early 20th century, cultivation of kiwifruit spread from China to New Zealand, where the first commercial plantings took place. It gained popularity among British and American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during World War II, and later became commonly exported, first to the United Kingdom and Australia from 1953, followed by California in 1959.
>
> From the late 20th century, countries beyond New Zealand initiated independent kiwifruit breeding programs, including China and Italy. As of 2023, China accounted for 55% of the world's total kiwifruit production, making it the largest global producer.
