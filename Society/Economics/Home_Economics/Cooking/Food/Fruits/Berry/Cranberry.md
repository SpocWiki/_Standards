> Cranberries are a group of evergreen dwarf shrubs or trailing vines in the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium. 
> Cranberries are low, creeping shrubs or vines up to 2 meters (7 ft) long and 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 in) in height; 
> they have slender stems that are not thickly woody and have small evergreen leaves. The flowers are dark pink. 
> The fruit is a berry that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially light green, turning red when ripe. 
> It is edible, but has an acidic taste.
>
> In Britain, **Cranberry** may refer to the native species Vaccinium oxycoccos, 
> while in North America, cranberry may refer to Vaccinium macrocarpon. 
> Vaccinium oxycoccos is cultivated in central and northern Europe, 
> while V. macrocarpon is cultivated throughout the northern United States, Canada and Chile. 
> 
> In some methods of classification, Oxycoccus is regarded as a genus in its own right. 
> Cranberries can be found in acidic bogs throughout the cooler regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
>
> In 2020, the U.S., Canada, and Chile accounted for 97% of the world production of cranberries. 
> Most cranberries are processed into products such as juice, sauce, jam, and sweetened dried cranberries, 
> with the remainder sold fresh to consumers. 
> 
> Cranberry sauce is a traditional accompaniment to turkey 
> at Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners in the U.S. and Canada, and at Christmas dinner in the United Kingdom.
