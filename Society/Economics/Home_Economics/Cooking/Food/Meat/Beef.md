## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Beef** is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). 
> Beef can be prepared in various ways; 
> cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, 
> while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. 
> 
> Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. 
> Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with 
> an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. 
> 
> Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation 
> with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.
>
> In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. 
> Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred 
> specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. 
> 
> Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. 
> As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.
>
> Some religions and cultures prohibit beef consumption, especially Indian religions like Hinduism. 
> Buddhists are also against animal slaughtering, but they do not have a wrongful eating doctrine.
