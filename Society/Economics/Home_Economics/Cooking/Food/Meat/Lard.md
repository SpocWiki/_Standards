> **Lard** is a semi-solid white fat product obtained by rendering the fatty tissue of a pig. 
> It is distinguished from tallow, a  similar product derived from fat of cattle or sheep.
>
> Lard can be rendered by steaming, boiling, or dry heat. 
> The culinary qualities of lard vary somewhat depending on the origin and processing method; 
> if properly rendered, it may be nearly odorless and tasteless.  
> It has a high saturated fatty acid content and no trans fat. 
> At retail, refined lard is usually sold as paper-wrapped blocks.
>
> Many cuisines use lard as a cooking fat or shortening, or as a spread in the same ways as butter. 
> It is an ingredient in various savoury dishes such as sausages, pâtés, and fillings. 
> As a replacement for butter, it provides flakiness to pastry. 
> 
> In western cuisine, it has ceded its popularity to vegetable oils, 
> but many cooks and bakers still favor it over other fats for certain uses.
