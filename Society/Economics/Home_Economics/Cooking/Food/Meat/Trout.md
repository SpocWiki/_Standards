## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Trout** (pl.: trout) is a generic common name 
> for numerous species of carnivorous freshwater fishes 
> belonging to the genera Oncorhynchus, Salmo, and Salvelinus, 
> all of which are members of the subfamily Salmoninae in the family Salmonidae. 
> 
> The word trout is also used for some similar-shaped but non-salmonid fish, 
> such as the spotted seatrout/speckled trout 
> (Cynoscion nebulosus, which is actually a croaker).
>
> Trout are closely related to salmon and have similar migratory life cycles. 
> Most trout are strictly potamodromous, spending their entire lives exclusively in freshwater lakes, rivers and wetlands and migrating upstream to spawn in the shallow gravel beds of smaller headwater creeks. The hatched fry and juvenile trout, known as alevin and parr, will stay upstream growing for years before migrating down to larger waterbodies as maturing adults. There are some anadromous species of trout, such as the steelhead (a coastal subspecies of rainbow trout) and sea trout (the sea-run subspecies of brown trout), that can spend up to three years of their adult lives at sea before returning to freshwater streams for spawning, in the same fashion as a salmon run. Brook trout and three other extant species of North American trout, despite the names, are actually char (or charr), which are salmonids also closely related to trout and salmon.
>
> Trout are classified as oily fish and have been important food fish for humans. As mid-level predators, trout prey upon smaller aquatic animals including crustaceans, insects, worms, baitfish and tadpoles, and themselves in turn are also important staple prey items for many animals, including brown bears, otters, raccoons, birds of prey (e.g. sea eagles, ospreys, fish owls), gulls, cormorants and kingfishers, and other large aquatic predators. Discarded remains of trout also provide a source of nutrients for scavengers, detrivores and riparian florae, making trout keystone species across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.
