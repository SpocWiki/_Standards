> A hot dog is a grilled, steamed, or boiled sausage 
> served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. 
> 
> The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself. 
> The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) 
> or a frankfurter (Frankfurter WÃ¼rstchen, also just called frank). 
> 
> The names of these sausages commonly refer to their assembled dish. 
> Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide. 
> Common condiments include mustard, ketchup, relish, onions in tomato sauce, 
> and cheese sauce. Other toppings include sauerkraut, diced onions, jalapeÃ±os, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
>
> These types of sausages were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States. It became a working-class street food in the U.S., sold at stands and carts. The hot dog has become closely associated with baseball and American culture. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century. Its preparation varies regionally in the country, emerging as an important part of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine.
