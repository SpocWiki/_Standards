## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Bacon** is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, 
> typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back. 
> 
> It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), 
> used as a central ingredient (e.g., the BLT sandwich), or as a flavouring or accent. 
> Regular bacon consumption is associated with increased mortality and other health concerns.
>
> Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, 
> and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. 
> The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic *bakkon*, meaning 'back meat'. 
>
> Meat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, 
> may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, 
> and may even be referred to as, for example, "turkey bacon". 
> 
> Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations 
> as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork. 
> Vegetarian bacons such as "soy bacon" also exist.
