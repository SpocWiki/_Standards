> **Pasta** (UK: , US: ; Italian: [ˈpasta]) is a type of food typically made from 
> an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, 
> and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. 
> 
> Pasta was originally only made with durum, 
> although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, 
> such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. 
> 
> Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, 
> with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.
>
> Pastas are divided into two broad categories: 
> - dried (Italian: pasta secca) and 
> - fresh (Italian: pasta fresca). 
> 
> Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, 
> although it can be produced at home. 
> 
> Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. 
> Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.
>
> Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, 
> with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names. 
> 
> In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. 
> For example, the pasta form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. 
> 
> Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, 
> miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.
>
> As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in 
> one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. 
> 
> Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. 
> Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. 
> Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. 
> Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.
>
> In terms of nutrition, 
> cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein and is low in fat, 
> with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has **low micronutrient content**. 
> Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.
