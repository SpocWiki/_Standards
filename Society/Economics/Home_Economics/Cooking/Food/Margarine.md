> **Margarine** is a spread used for flavoring, baking, and cooking. 
> It is most often used as a substitute for butter. 
> 
> Although originally made from animal fats, 
> most margarine consumed today is made from vegetable oil. 
> The spread was originally named oleomargarine from Latin for oleum (olive oil) 
> and Greek margarite ("pearl", indicating luster). 
> The name was later shortened to margarine, or sometimes oleo (particularly in the Deep South).
>
> Margarine consists of a water-in-fat emulsion, 
> with tiny droplets of water dispersed uniformly throughout a fat phase in a stable solid form. 
> 
> While butter is made by concentrating the butterfat of milk through centrifugation, 
> modern margarine is made through a more intensive processing of refined vegetable oil and water. 
>
> Per US federal regulation, products must have a minimum fat content of 80% 
> (with a maximum of 16% water) to be labeled "margarine" in the United States, 
> although the term is used informally to describe vegetable-oil-based spreads with lower fat content.
>
> Margarine can be used as an ingredient in other food products, such as pastries, doughnuts, cakes, and cookies.
