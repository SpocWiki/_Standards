> Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits whose main preserving agent is sugar 
> and sometimes acid, often stored in glass jars and used as a condiment or spread.
>
> There are many varieties of fruit preserves globally, 
> distinguished by the method of preparation, type of fruit used, and its place in a meal. 
> 
> Sweet fruit preserves such as **Jam**s, jellies, and marmalades are often eaten at breakfast with bread or as an ingredient of a pastry or dessert, whereas more savory and acidic preserves made from "Vegetable fruits" such as tomato, squash or zucchini, are eaten alongside savory foods such as cheese, cold meats, and curries.
