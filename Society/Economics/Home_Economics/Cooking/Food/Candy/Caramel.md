> **Caramel** is a range of food ingredients made by heating sugars to high temperatures. 
> It is used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons or candy bars, 
> as a topping for ice cream and custard, and as a colorant commonly used in drinks.
>
> The process of caramelization primarily consists of heating sugars slowly to around 170 °C (340 °F). 
> As the sugar heats, the molecules break down 
> and re-form into compounds with a characteristic colour and flavour.
>
> A variety of sweets, desserts, toppings, and confections are made with caramel, 
> including tres leches cake, brittles, nougats, pralines, flan, crème brûlée, crème caramel, and caramel apples.
