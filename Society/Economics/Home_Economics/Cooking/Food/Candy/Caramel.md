> It is used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons or candy bars, 
> as a topping for ice cream and custard, and as a colorant commonly used in drinks.
>
> The process of caramelization primarily consists of heating sugars slowly to around 170 °C (340 °F). 
> As the sugar heats, the molecules break down 
> and re-form into compounds with a characteristic colour and flavour.
