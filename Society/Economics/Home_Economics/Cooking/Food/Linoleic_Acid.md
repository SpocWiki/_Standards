> **linoleic acid** (LA) is an organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)4CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)7COOH. 
> Both alkene groups (−CH=CH−) are cis. 
> It is a fatty acid sometimes denoted 18:2 (n−6) or 18:2 cis-9,12. 
> 
> A linoleate is a salt or ester of this acid.
>
> Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated, omega−6 fatty acid. 
> It is a colorless liquid that is virtually insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. 
> It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. 
> It is one of two **essential fatty acids for humans**, who must obtain it through their diet, 
> and the most essential, because the body uses it as a base to make the others.
>
> The word "linoleic" derives from Latin linum 'flax' and  oleum 'oil', 
> reflecting the fact that it was **first isolated from linseed oil**.
