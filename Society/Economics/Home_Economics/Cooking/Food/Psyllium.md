> **Psyllium**, or Isabgol or ispaghula, is the common name used for several members of the plant genus Plantago 
> whose seeds are used commercially for the production of mucilage. 
> Psyllium is mainly used as a dietary fiber to relieve symptoms of **both constipation and mild diarrhea**, 
> and occasionally as a food thickener. 
> 
> Allergy to psyllium is common in workers frequently exposed to the substance.
>
> It is generally safe and moderately effective as a laxative. 
> Use of psyllium in the diet for three weeks or longer may lower blood cholesterol levels, 
> and may lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. 
> Use of psyllium for a month or longer may produce a small reduction in systolic blood pressure.
>
> The plants from which the seeds are extracted tolerate damp and cool climates, 
> and are mainly cultivated in northern India.
