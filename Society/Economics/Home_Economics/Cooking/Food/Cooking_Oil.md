## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Cooking oil (also known as edible oil) is a plant or animal liquid fat 
> used in frying, baking, and other types of cooking. 
> 
> Oil allows higher cooking temperatures than water, 
> making cooking faster and more flavorful, while likewise distributing heat, 
> reducing burning and uneven cooking. 
> 
> It sometimes imparts its own flavor. 
> Cooking oil is also used in food preparation and flavoring not involving heat, such as salad dressings and bread dips.
>
> Cooking oil is typically a liquid at room temperature, although some oils that contain saturated fat, such as coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil are solid.
>
> There are a wide variety of cooking oils from plant sources such as olive oil, palm oil, soybean oil, canola oil (rapeseed oil), corn oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil and other vegetable oils, as well as animal-based oils like butter and lard.
>
> Oil can be flavored with aromatic foodstuffs such as herbs, chilies or garlic. Cooking spray is an aerosol of cooking oil.
