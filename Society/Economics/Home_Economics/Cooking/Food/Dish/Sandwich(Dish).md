## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Sandwich** is a dish typically consisting variously of meat, cheese, sauces, and vegetables used as a filling between slices of bread, or placed atop a slice of bread; 
> or, more generally, any dish in which bread serves as a container or wrapper 
> for another food type. 
> 
> The sandwich began as a portable, convenient food in the Western world, 
> and over time it has become prevalent worldwide.
>
> There has been social media debate over the precise definition of sandwich, 
> specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorised as such. 
> Other items, like hamburgers and burritos, were also considered. 
> 
> In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
> and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
> are the responsible agencies for protecting the definition of sandwich. 
> 
> The USDA uses the definition, 
> - "at least 35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, and 
> - "at least 50% cooked meat" for open sandwiches. 
> However, the same USDA manual determines that 
> - burritos and fajitas are "sandwich-like" and 
> - frankfurters are "sandwich type", 
> - while stromboli is explicitly excluded. 
> 
> In Britain, the British Sandwich Association defines a sandwich as 
> "any form of bread with a filling, generally assembled cold"; 
> a definition which includes wraps and bagels, 
> but potentially excludes dishes assembled and served hot, such as burgers.
>
> Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics 
> to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. 
> 
> The bread is frequently coated with condiments such as mayonnaise or mustard 
> to enhance its flavour and texture, but may be served plain ("dry"). 
> 
> As well as being homemade, sandwiches are also widely sold in various retail outlets 
> and can be served hot or cold. 
> 
> Although savoury sandwiches—such as deli meat sandwiches—are in the majority, 
> sweet sandwiches—such as jam sandwiches and fluffernutters—form their own category.
>
> The sandwich is named after the inventor of a certain roast-beef sandwich 
> in 18th-century England, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. 
> The Wall Street Journal has described it as Britain's "biggest contribution to gastronomy".
