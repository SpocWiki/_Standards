## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Pie** is a baked dish which is usually made of a pastry dough casing 
> that contains a filling of various sweet or savoury ingredients. 
> 
> Sweet pies may be filled with fruit (as in an apple pie), nuts (pecan pie), 
> fruit preserves (jam tart), brown sugar (sugar pie), sweetened vegetables (rhubarb pie), 
> or with thicker fillings based on eggs and dairy (as in custard pie and cream pie). 
> 
> Savoury pies may be filled with meat (as in a steak pie or a Jamaican patty), 
> eggs and cheese (such as quiches or British flans) 
> or a mixture of meat and vegetables (pot pie).
>
> Pies are defined by their crusts. 
> A filled pie (also single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, 
> and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. 
> 
> A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish 
> and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. 
> 
> A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. 
> 
> Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, 
> but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, 
> mashed potatoes, and crumbs.
>
> Pies can be a variety of sizes, ranging from bite-size to those designed for multiple servings.
