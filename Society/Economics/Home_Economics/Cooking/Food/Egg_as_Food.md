## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Humans and other hominids have consumed eggs for millions of years. 
> The most widely consumed eggs are those of fowl, especially chickens. 
> People in Southeast Asia began harvesting chicken eggs for food by 1500 BCE. 
> Eggs of other birds, such as ducks and ostriches, 
> are eaten regularly but much less commonly than those of chickens. 
> People may also eat the eggs of reptiles, amphibians, and fish. 
> Fish eggs consumed as food are known as roe or caviar.
>
> Hens and other egg-laying creatures are raised throughout the world, 
> and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry. 
> 
> In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide 
> from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens. 
> There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, 
> as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. 
> 
> In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens.
