> In food processing, **Pasteurization** (also pasteurisation) is a process of food preservation 
> in which packaged foods (e.g., milk and fruit juices) are treated with mild heat, 
> usually to less than 100 °C (212 °F), to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life. 
> 
> Pasteurization either destroys or deactivates microorganisms and enzymes 
> that contribute to food spoilage or the risk of disease, 
> including vegetative bacteria, but most bacterial spores survive the process.
>
> Pasteurization is named after the French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, 
> whose research in the 1860s demonstrated 
> that thermal processing would deactivate unwanted microorganisms in wine. 
> Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization. 
> Today, pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries 
> for food preservation and food safety.
>
> By the year 1999, most liquid products were heat treated in a continuous system 
> where heat was applied using a heat exchanger or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam. 
> Due to the mild heat, there are minor changes 
> to the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of the treated foods. 
> 
> Pascalization or high-pressure processing (HPP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) 
> are non-thermal processes that are also used to pasteurize foods.
