## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pastry** refers to a variety of doughs (often enriched with fat or eggs), 
> as well as the sweet and savoury baked goods made from them. 
> 
> The dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity. 
> Sweetened pastries are often described as baker's confectionery. 
> Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and turnovers. 
>
> The French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) 
> for many of the same foods, as well as the set of techniques used to make them. 
> 
> Originally, the French word pastisserie referred to anything, 
> such as a meat pie, made in dough (paste, later pâte) 
> and not typically a luxurious or sweet product. 
> 
> This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, 
> though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today.
