> A **Soft Drink** is a class of drink containing no alcohol, 
> usually (but not necessarily) carbonated, and typically including added sweetener. 
> 
> Flavors can be natural, artificial or a mixture of the two. 
> The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute 
> (in the case of diet sodas), or some combination of these. 
> 
> Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives and other ingredients. 
> Coffee, tea, milk, cocoa, and unaltered fruit and vegetable juices are not considered soft drinks.
>
> Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks 
> and their counterparts: non-alcoholic drinks. 
> 
> Small amounts of alcohol may be present in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink (ABV) in many countries and localities if the drink is to not be considered alcoholic. Examples of soft drinks include lemon-lime drinks, orange soda, cola, grape soda, cream soda, ginger ale and root beer.
>
> Soft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines and bars from soda fountain machines.
>
> Within a decade of the invention of carbonated water by Joseph Priestley in 1767, 
> inventors in Europe had used his concept to produce the drink in greater quantities. 
> One such inventor, J. J. Schweppe, formed Schweppes in 1783 and began selling the world's first bottled soft drink. 
> Soft drink brands founded in the 19th century include 
> R. White's Lemonade in 1845, Dr Pepper in 1885 and Coca-Cola in 1886. 
> Subsequent brands include Pepsi, Irn-Bru, Sprite, Fanta, 7 Up and RC Cola.
