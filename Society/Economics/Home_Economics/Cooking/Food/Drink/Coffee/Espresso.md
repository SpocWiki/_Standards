> **Espresso** (Italian: [eˈsprɛsso]) is a concentrated form of coffee 
> produced by forcing hot water under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans. 
> 
> Originating in Italy, 
> espresso has become one of the most popular coffee-brewing methods worldwide. 
> It is characterized by its small serving size, typically 25–30 ml, 
> and its distinctive layers: a dark body topped with a lighter-colored foam called "crema".
>
> Espresso machines use pressure to extract a highly concentrated coffee 
> with a complex flavor profile in a short time, usually 25–30 seconds. 
> The result is a beverage with a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids 
> than regular drip coffee, giving espresso its characteristic body and intensity. 
> While espresso contains more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, 
> its typical serving size results in less caffeine per serving compared to larger drinks such as drip coffee.
>
> Espresso serves as the base for other coffee drinks, including cappuccino, caffè latte, and americano. It can be made with various types of coffee beans and roast levels, allowing for a wide range of flavors and strengths, despite the widespread myth that it is made with dark-roast coffee beans. The quality of an espresso is influenced by factors such as the grind size, water temperature, pressure, and the barista's skill in tamping the coffee grounds.
>
> The cultural significance of espresso extends beyond its consumption, playing a central role in coffee shop culture and the third-wave coffee movement, which emphasizes artisanal production and high-quality beans.
