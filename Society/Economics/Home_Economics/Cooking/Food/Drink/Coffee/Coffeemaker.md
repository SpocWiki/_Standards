## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Coffeemaker**, coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee. 
> While there are many different types of coffeemakers, 
> the two most common brewing principles use gravity or pressure 
> to move hot water through coffee grounds. 
> 
> In the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, 
> which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family. 
> 
> Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel 
> and allowed to drip through the grounds under gravity. 
> This is also called automatic drip-brew. 
> 
> Coffee makers that use pressure to force water through the coffee grounds 
> are called espresso makers, and they produce espresso coffee.
