## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Coconut milk is a plant milk extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts. 
> The opacity and rich taste of the milky-white liquid are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. 
> 
> Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. 
> It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, Central America, 
> northern parts of South America and West Africa, 
> where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.
>
> Coconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content. 
> They can be generalized into 
> - coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) with the highest amount of fat; 
> - coconut milk (or thin coconut milk) with a maximum of around 20% fat; and 
> - coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat. 
> This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in Western countries.
>
> Coconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes 
> (sometimes differentiated as "coconut milk beverages"); 
> these products are meant for drinking, not cooking. 
> 
> A sweetened, processed, coconut milk product from Puerto Rico is also known as cream of coconut. 
> It is used in many desserts and beverages like the piÃ±a colada, 
> though it should not be confused with coconut cream.
