> Iced tea (or ice tea) is a form of cold tea. 
> Though it is usually served in a glass with ice, it can refer to any tea that has been chilled or cooled. 
> It may be sweetened with sugar or syrup, or remain unsweetened. 
> Iced tea is also a popular packaged drink, 
> normally mixed with fruit-flavored syrup such as lemon and peach.
>
> While most iced teas get their flavor from tea leaves (Camellia sinensis), 
> herbal teas are sometimes served cold and referred to under the same categorical name. 
> 
> Sun tea is made by a particularly long steeping of tea leaves at a lower temperature 
> (one hour in the sun, versus five minutes at 80 to 100 °C (176 to 212 °F).
