## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Cola** is a carbonated soft drink flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils, and other flavorings. 
> The name, however, comes from the kola nut (Cola acuminata), 
> which imbues the beverage with caffeine 
> (though other sources of caffeine are generally used in modern formulations). 
> A stimulating soda using kola appeared circa 1880.
>
> Cola became popular worldwide after the success of Coca-Cola, 
> a trademarked brand and symbol of American capitalism 
> which has been imitated by other manufacturers. 
> 
> In 1886, American pharmacist John Stith Pemberton finetuned his recipe for a soft drink; 
> it also contained unspent coca leaf extract, and therefore cocaine. 
> His non-alcoholic recipe was directly inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, 
> created in 1863. 
> Local prohibition laws forced him to adapt his recent creation: French Wine Coca.
>
> Most modern colas have a dark caramel color and are sweetened with sugar, 
> high-fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. 
> 
> There are numerous different brands, with Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola being among the most popular. 
> These two colas have been competitors since the 1890s, a rivalry that has intensified since the 1980s.
