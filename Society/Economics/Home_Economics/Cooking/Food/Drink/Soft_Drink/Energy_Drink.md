> An energy drink is a type of non-alcoholic psychoactive functional beverage 
> containing stimulant compounds, 
> usually caffeine (at a higher concentration than ordinary soda pop) and taurine, 
> which is marketed as reducing tiredness and improving performance and concentration 
> (marketed as "energy", but distinct from food energy). 
> 
> They may or may not be carbonated and may also contain sugar, 
> other sweeteners, or herbal extracts, among numerous other possible ingredients. 
> 
> Energy drinks are different from sugar-sweetened beverages. 
> While both energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages typically contain high levels of sugar, 
> energy drinks include stimulants like caffeine and taurine and are marketed for energy, 
> and sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas and fruit juices usually do not.
>
> They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels, 
> and distinct from sports drinks, which are advertised to enhance sports performance. 
> There are many brands and varieties in this drink category.
>
> Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar, but there is little or no evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.
>
> Advertising for energy drinks usually features increased muscle strength and endurance, but there is no scientific consensus to support these claims. Energy drinks have been associated with many health risks, such as an increased rate of injury when usage is combined with alcohol, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. Populations at risk for complications from energy drink consumption include youth, caffeine-naive or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant, competitive athletes and people with underlying cardiovascular disease.
