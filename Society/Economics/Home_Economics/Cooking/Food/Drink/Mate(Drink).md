> Mate (MAH-tay; Spanish: mate [Ëˆmate], Portuguese: [ËˆmatÊƒi]) is a traditional Paraguayan, 
> Uruguayan, Argentine and South Brazilian caffeine-rich infused herbal drink. It is also known as chimarrÃ£o in Portuguese, cimarrÃ³n in Spanish, and kaÊ¼ay in Guarani. It is made by soaking dried yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) leaves in hot water and is traditionally served with a metal straw (bombilla) in a container typically made from a calabash gourd (also called the mate), from water-resistant hardwoods such as Lapacho or Palo Santo, and also made from a cattle horn (guampa) in some areas. A very similar preparation, known as mate cocido, removes some of the plant material and sometimes comes in tea bags. Today, mate is sold commercially in tea bags and as bottled iced tea.

> Mate has been originally consumed by the GuaranÃ­ and Tupi peoples native to Paraguay, north-east of Argentina and South of Brazil. After European colonization, it was spread across the Southern Cone countries, namely Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile, but it is also consumed in the South of Brazil and the Bolivian Chaco. Mate is the national beverage of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. In Chile, mate is predominantly consumed in the central and southern regions. Mate is also popular in Lebanon and Syria, where it was brought by immigrants from Argentina.
