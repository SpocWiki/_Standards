## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, 
> produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. 
> 
> It comes in several different varieties, including 
> blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. 
> 
> As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of 
> juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. 
> 
> These vesicles contain the juice of the orange 
> and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. 
> How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. 
> In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".
>
> Commercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made 
> by pasteurizing the juice and removing the oxygen from it. 
> 
> This removes much of the taste, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, 
> generally made from orange products. 
> Additionally, some juice is further processed by drying and later rehydrating the juice, 
> or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate.
>
> The health value of orange juice is debatable: 
> - it has a high concentration of vitamin C, 
> - but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. 
> As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted 
> to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, 
> which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.
