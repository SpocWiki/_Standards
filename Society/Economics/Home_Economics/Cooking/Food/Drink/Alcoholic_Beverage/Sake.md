> **Sake**, saké (Japanese: 酒, Hepburn: sake; English: IPA:  SAH-kee, SAK-ay), or saki, 
> also referred to as Japanese rice wine, is an alcoholic beverage of Japanese origin 
> made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. 
> 
> Despite the name Japanese rice wine, sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine 
> (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process 
> more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars that ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes.
>
> Although similar, the brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, in which the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, these conversions occur simultaneously when brewing sake. The typical alcohol content also differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3–9% ABV and wine generally contains 9–16% ABV,, undiluted sake contains 18–20% ABV (although this is typically lowered somewhat by diluting with water prior to bottling).
>
> In Japanese, the character sake (kanji: 酒, Japanese pronunciation: [sake]) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed nihonshu (日本酒; meaning 'Japanese alcoholic drink'). Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word seishu (清酒, 'refined alcohol'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation.
>
> In Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a sakazuki. As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type.
