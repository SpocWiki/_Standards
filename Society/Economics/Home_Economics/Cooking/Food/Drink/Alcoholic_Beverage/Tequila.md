> **Tequila** (Spanish: [teˈkila] ) is a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, 
> primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, 
> and in the Jaliscan Highlands (Los Altos de Jalisco) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco.
>
> The red volcanic soils in the region of Tequila are well suited for growing the blue agave, and more than 300 million plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the valley region have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavor. Due to its historical and cultural importance, the region near Tequila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006, the Agave Landscape and Ancient Industrial Facilities of Tequila.
>
> Tequila differs from other mezcals—distilled spirits from the agave plant—because it is made only from blue agave. By Mexican law, no beverage may be sold as tequila unless it contains between 35% and 55% alcohol content (70 and 110 U.S. proof) and is produced in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. 
>
> International agreements also prevent the sale of "tequila" produced outside Mexico. The drink is recognized as a Mexican designation of origin product in more than 40 countries. It was protected through NAFTA in Canada and the United States until July 2020 and through bilateral agreements with individual countries such as Japan and Israel, and it has been a protected designation of origin product in the European Union since 1997.
>
> Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime around the world.
