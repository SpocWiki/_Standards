## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties - red grapes. 
> The color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, 
> through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. 
> 
> The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, 
> the red color coming from anthocyan pigments present in the skin of the grape. 
> Much of the red wine production process involves 
> extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin.
