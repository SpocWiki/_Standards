> **Brandy** is a liquor produced by distilling wine. 
> Brandy generally contains 35–60% alcohol by volume (70–120 US proof) 
> and is typically consumed as an after-dinner digestif. 
> Some brandies are aged in wooden casks. 
> Others are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of ageing, 
> and some are produced using a combination of ageing and colouring. 
> 
> Varieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. 
> Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France.
>
> In a broader sense, 
> the term brandy also denotes liquors obtained from the distillation of pomace 
> (yielding pomace brandy), or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy). 
> These products are also called eau de vie (literally "water of life" in French).
