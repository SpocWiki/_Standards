> A **Liqueur** (UK:   li-KURE, US:  li-KUR; French: [likœʁ]) is an alcoholic drink composed of spirits 
> (often rectified spirit) and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices. 
> 
> Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged, 
> beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle.
>
> Liqueurs are historical descendants of herbal medicines. 
> They were made in France as early as the 13th century, often prepared by monks (for example, Chartreuse). 
> Today they are produced all over the world, commonly served neat, over ice, with coffee, in cocktails, and used in cooking.
