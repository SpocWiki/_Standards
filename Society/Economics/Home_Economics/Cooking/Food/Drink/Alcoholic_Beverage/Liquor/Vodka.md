## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Vodka** (Polish: wódka [ˈvutka]; Russian: водка [ˈvotkə]) is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage. 
> 
> Its varieties originated in Poland and Russia. 
> Vodka is composed mainly of water and ethanol (alcohol), 
> but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings. 
> 
> Traditionally, it is made by 
> distilling liquid from fermented cereal grains and potatoes 
> since the latter was introduced in Europe in the 18th century. 
> Some modern brands use maize, sugar cane, fruit, honey, and maple sap as the base.
>
> Since the 1890s, standard vodkas have been 40% alcohol by volume (ABV) 
> (80 U.S. proof). 
> The European Union has established a minimum alcohol content of 37.5% for vodka. 
> Vodka in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40%.
>
> Vodka is traditionally drunk "neat" (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixers), 
> and it is often served freezer chilled in the so-called 
> "vodka belt" of Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and Ukraine. 
> 
> It is also used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the 
> vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, screwdriver, greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow mule, Bloody Mary, Caesar and Red Bull Vodka.
>
> Since 1960s, the unflavoured Swedish brännvin also came to be called vodka.
