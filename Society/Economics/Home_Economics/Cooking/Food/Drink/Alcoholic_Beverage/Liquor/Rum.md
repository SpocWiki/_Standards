## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Rum** is a liquor made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice. 
> The distillate, a clear liquid, is often aged in barrels of oak. 
> Rum originated in the Caribbean in the 17th century, 
> but today it is produced in nearly every major sugar-producing region of the world.
>
> Rums are produced in various grades. 
> Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, grog, or toddy, 
> whereas "golden" and "dark" rums, once typically drunk straight (U.S. English) 
> or neat (Commonwealth English), iced ("on the rocks"), 
> or in cooking, are now commonly drunk with mixers. 
> Premium rums are made to be consumed either straight or iced.
>
> Rum plays a part in the culture of most islands of the West Indies 
> as well as the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland, in Canada. 
> 
> It has associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) 
> and Caribbean piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). 
> 
> Rum has served as a medium of economic exchange, 
> used to help fund enterprises such as slavery via triangular trade, organized crime, 
> and military insurgencies such as the American Revolution and the Australian Rum Rebellion.
