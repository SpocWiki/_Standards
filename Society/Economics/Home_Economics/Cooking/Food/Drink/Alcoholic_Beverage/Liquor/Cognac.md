> **Cognac** (KON-yak, also US:   KOHN-, KAWN-, French: [kɔɲak] ) 
> is a variety of brandy named after the commune of Cognac, France. 
> 
> It is produced in the surrounding departments of Charente 
> and Charente-Maritime, in an officially designated wine-growing region. 
> This region is divided into six districts with different cognacs produced in each.
>
> Cognac production falls under French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designation, 
> with production methods and naming required to meet certain legal requirements. 
> 
> Among the specified grapes, Ugni blanc, known locally as Saint-Émilion, 
> is most widely used. 
> 
> The brandy must be twice distilled in copper pot stills 
> and aged at least two years in French oak barrels from Limousin or Tronçais, 
> Allier or Nevers – the majority coming from the first two. 
> 
> Cognac matures in the same way as whiskies and wines barrel-age, 
> and most cognacs spend considerably longer "on the wood" 
> than the minimum legal requirement.
>
> Cognac is often drunk in glasses such as the snifter, 
> which has a large tapered bowl and short stem. 
> 
> Such glasses allow the drinker to enjoy the aroma of the drink 
> by placing their hand underneath the bowl and warming the cognac inside, 
> causing it to produce more fumes.
