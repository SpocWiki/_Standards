> Olive oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing whole olives 
> (the fruit of Olea europaea, a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin) and extracting the oil.
>
> It is commonly used in cooking for frying foods, as a condiment, or as a salad dressing. 
> It can also be found in some cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, and fuels for traditional oil lamps. 
> It also has additional uses in some religions. 
> 
> The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, with wheat and grapes. 
> Olive trees have been cultivated around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC.
>
> In 2022, Spain was the world's largest producer, manufacturing 24% of the world's total. 
> Other large producers were Italy, Greece, and Turkey, 
> collectively accounting for 59% of the global market.
>
> The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process. 
> It consists mainly of [[Oleic_Acid]] (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including 
> - [[Linoleic_Acid]] (up to 21%) and 
> - [[palmitic acid]] (up to 20%). 
> 
> Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity, 
> and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics.
