> **Noodle**s are a type of food typically made from unleavened dough 
> which is rolled flat and cut, stretched, or extruded into long strips or strings. 
> 
> Noodles are a staple food in many cultures and made into a variety of shapes. 
> The most common noodles are those derived from either Chinese cuisine or Italian cuisine. 
> 
> Italian noodles are known as pasta, 
> while Chinese noodles are known by a variety of different names 
> as there is no single unifying concept or terminology for "noodles" within Chinese culture. 
> 
> Additionally, many Chinese foods labeled as "noodles" in the English language 
> are not made from dough but are called "noodles" 
> because they serve a similar culinary role to dough-based noodles.
>
> While long, thin strips may be the most common, 
> many varieties of noodles are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, 
> or cut into other shapes. 
> 
> Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. 
> They can also be steamed, pan-fried, deep-fried, or baked. 
> 
> Noodles are often served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup, 
> the latter being known as noodle soup. 
> 
> Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.
