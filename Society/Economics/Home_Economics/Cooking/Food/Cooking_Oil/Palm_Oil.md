## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Palm oil is an edible vegetable oil 
> derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the African oil palm. 
> 
> The oil is used in food manufacturing, in beauty products, and as biofuel. 
> Palm oil accounted for about 36% of global oils produced from oil crops in 2014. 
> Palm oils are easier to stabilize and maintain quality of flavor and consistency 
> in ultra-processed foods, so they are frequently favored by food manufacturers.  
> 
> Globally, humans consumed an average of 7.7 kg (17 lb) of palm oil per person in 2015. 
> Demand has also increased for other uses, such as cosmetics and biofuels, 
> encouraging the growth of palm oil plantations in tropical countries.
>
> The mass production of palm oil in the tropics 
> has attracted the concern of environmental and human rights groups. 
> The palm oil industry is a significant contributor to deforestation in the tropics 
> where palms are grown and has been cited as a factor in social problems 
> due to allegations of human rights violations among growers. 
>
> In 2018, a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature acknowledged 
> that palm oil is much more efficient than other oils in terms of land and water usage; 
> however, deforestation causes more biodiversity loss than switching to other oils. 
> 
> The biggest global producers of palm oil are Indonesia, which produced 60% of it in 2022, 
> followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and Nigeria. 
> 
> Indonesia produces biodiesel primarily from palm oil.
