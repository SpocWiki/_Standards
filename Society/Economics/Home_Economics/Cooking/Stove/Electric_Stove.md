## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An electric stove, electric cooker or electric range 
> is a stove with an integrated electrical heating device to cook and bake. 
> Electric stoves became popular as replacements for solid-fuel (wood or coal) stoves 
> which required more labor to operate and maintain. 
> 
> Some modern stoves come in a unit with built-in extractor hoods.
>
> The stove's one or more "burners" (heating elements) 
> may be controlled by a rotary switch with a finite number of positions; 
> or may have an "infinite switch" called a simmerstat 
> that allows constant variability between minimum and maximum heat settings. 
> Some stove burners and controls incorporate thermostats.
