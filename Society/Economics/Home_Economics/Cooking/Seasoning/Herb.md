> **herbs** are a widely distributed and widespread group of plants, excluding vegetables, 
> with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and garnishing food, 
> for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances. 
> 
> Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. 
> Herbs generally refers to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), 
> while spices are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, 
> including seeds, bark, roots and fruits.
>
> Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, aromatic and in some cases, spiritual. 
> General usage of the term "herb" differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs; 
> in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered "herbs", 
> including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), resin and pericarp.
>
> The word "herb" is pronounced  in Commonwealth English, 
> but  is standard among American English speakers as well as those from regions where h-dropping occurs. 
> In Canadian English, both pronunciations are common. 
> 
> In botany, the noun "herb" refers to a "plant that does not produce a woody stem", 
> and the adjective "herbaceous" means "herb-like",
