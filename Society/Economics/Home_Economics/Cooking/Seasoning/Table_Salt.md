## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In common usage, **Salt** is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). 
> When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. 
> 
> In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. 
> 
> Salt is essential for life in general 
> (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), 
> and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. 
> 
> Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, 
> and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, 
> including otherwise unpalatable food. 
> 
> Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.
>
> Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, 
> when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; 
> a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. 
> 
> Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. 
> 
> Salt became an important article of trade 
> and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, 
> along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. 
> 
> The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it 
> and use it to raise tax revenues. 
> 
> Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.
>
> Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) 
> and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. 
> 
> The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a 
> feedstock for the production of chemicals. 
> 
> It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, 
> and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. 
> 
> Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, 
> only a small percentage is used for human consumption. 
> 
> Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. 
> 
> Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt, 
> the latter of which usually contains an anti-caking agent 
> and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. 
> 
> As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.
>
> Sodium is an essential element for human health 
> via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. 
> 
> However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases 
> such as hypertension. 
> 
> Such health effects of salt have long been studied. 
> Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries 
> recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. 
> 
> The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume 
> less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.
