## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Nutmeg** is the seed, or the ground spice derived from the seed, 
> of several tree species of the genus Myristica; 
> fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg (M. fragrans) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree 
> cultivated for two spices derived from its fruit: 
> - nutmeg, from its seed, and 
> - mace, from the seed covering. 
> 
> It is also a commercial source of nutmeg essential oil and nutmeg butter. The Banda Islands, in Maluku, Indonesia, are the main producer of nutmeg and mace, and the true nutmeg tree is native to the islands.
>
> Nutmeg and mace, commonly used as food spices, have been traditionally employed for their psychoactive and aphrodisiac effects, though clinical evidence is lacking. High doses can cause serious toxic effects including acute psychosis, with risks heightened during pregnancy and with psychiatric conditions.
>
> Conifers of the genus Torreya, commonly known as the nutmeg yews, have edible seeds of similar appearance, but are not closely related to M. fragrans, and are not used as a spice.

Mace

Mace is the spice made from the reddish seed covering ([aril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aril "Aril")) of the nutmeg seed. 
Its flavour is similar to that of nutmeg but more delicate; it is used to flavour baked goods, meat, fish, and vegetables, and in preserving and pickling.

In the processing of mace, 
the crimson-colored aril is removed from the nutmeg seed that it envelops 
and is flattened out and dried for 10 to 14 days. 
Its color changes to pale yellow, orange, or tan. 

Whole dry mace consists of flat pieces—smooth, horn-like, and brittle—about 40 mm (1+1⁄2 in) long.
