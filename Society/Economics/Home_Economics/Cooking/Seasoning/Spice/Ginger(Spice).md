## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ginger** (Zingiber officinale) is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or ginger, 
> is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine. 
> 
> It is an herbaceous perennial 
> that grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) 
> about one meter tall, bearing narrow leaf blades. 
> The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, 
> and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots.
>
> Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. 
> 
> Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia 
> and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. 
> 
> It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific 
> during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. 
> 
> Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, 
> arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. 
> 
> The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger 
> because of their similar taste. 
>
> Ginger has been used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, 
> and as a modern dietary supplement. 
> 
> Ginger may offer benefits over placebo for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, 
> but there is no good evidence that it helps with nausea during chemotherapy. 
> 
> It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective for treating any disease. 
> In 2023, world production of ginger was 4.9 million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total.
