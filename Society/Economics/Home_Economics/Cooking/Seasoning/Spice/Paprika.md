> **Paprika** is a spice made from dried and ground red peppers, Capsicum annuum. 
> 
> It can have varying levels of heat, 
> but the peppers used for hot paprika tend to be milder and have thinner flesh 
> than those used to produce chili powder. 
> 
> The milder, sweet paprika is mostly composed of the fruit of the pepper 
> with most of the seeds removed; 
> whereas some seeds and stalks are retained in the peppers used for hotter paprika.
>
> Paprika, like all capsicum varieties and their derivatives, 
> is descended from wild ancestors from the Amazon River, 
> cultivated in ancient times in South, Central and North America, 
> particularly in central Mexico. 
> 
> The peppers were introduced to Europe via Spain and Portugal in the 16th century. 
> The trade in paprika expanded from the Iberian Peninsula to Africa and Asia 
> and ultimately reached central Europe through the Balkans.
>
> European cuisines in which paprika is a frequent and major ingredient include 
> Hungary, Spain and Portugal; it is also found in many French and German dishes. 
> It is widely used in North Africa and the Middle East.
