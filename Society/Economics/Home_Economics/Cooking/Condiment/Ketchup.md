> **Ketchup** or catsup is a table condiment with a sweet and sour flavor. 
> "Ketchup" now typically refers to tomato ketchup, although early recipes for different varieties 
> contained mushrooms, oysters, mussels, egg whites, grapes, or walnuts, among other ingredients. 
>
> Tomato ketchup is made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. 
> The spices and flavors vary but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, 
> cumin, garlic, mustard and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger. 
> 
> The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and the United Kingdom (82%) 
> is Heinz Tomato Ketchup. 
> Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment for dishes that are usually served hot, 
> and are fried or greasy: e.g., french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers, hot dogs, 
> chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat.
>
> Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, 
> and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.
