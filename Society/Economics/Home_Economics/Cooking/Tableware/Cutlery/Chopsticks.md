## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Chopsticks** are shaped pairs of equal-length sticks 
> that have been used as kitchen and eating utensils in most of East Asia for over three millennia. 
> They are held in the dominant hand, secured by fingers, 
> and wielded as extensions of the hand, to pick up food. 
>
> Originating in China, chopsticks later spread to other parts of continental Asia. 
> Chopsticks have become more accepted in connection with East Asian food in the West, 
> especially in cities with significant East Asian diaspora communities. 
> The use of chopsticks has also spread to the rest of Southeast Asia either 
> via the Chinese diaspora or through some dishes such as noodles that may require chopsticks.
>
> Chopsticks are smoothed, and frequently tapered. 
> They are traditionally made of wood, bamboo, metal, ivory, and ceramics, 
> and in modern days, increasingly available in non-traditional materials 
> such as plastic, stainless steel, and even titanium. 
> 
> Chopsticks are often seen as requiring practice and skill to master to be used as an eating utensil.  
> In some countries, failing to follow etiquette in their use is frowned upon, 
> though such feelings are generally lesser than they once were.
