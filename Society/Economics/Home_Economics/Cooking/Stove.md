> A **Stove** or range is a device that generates heat inside or on top of the device, for local heating or cooking. 
> Stoves can be powered with many fuels, such as natural gas, electricity, gasoline, wood, and coal.
>
> The most common materials stoves are made of are cast iron, steel, and stone. 
>
> Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to improve stove design. 
> Pellet stoves are a type of clean-burning stove. 
> Air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely 
> and therefore, reduce the amount of the combustion by-products. 
> 
> Another method of reducing air pollution is through the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas, 
> for example, a filter or afterburner.
>
> Research and development on safer and less emission releasing stoves is continuously evolving.
