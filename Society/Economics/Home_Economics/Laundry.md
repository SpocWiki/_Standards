# [[Laundry]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Laundry** is the washing of clothing and other textiles, 
> and, more broadly, their drying and ironing as well. 
> 
> Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, 
> so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need 
> are of interest to several branches of scholarship.
>
> Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, 
> with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen). 
> 
> The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, 
> notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. 
> Laundry, like cooking and child care, is still done both at home 
> and by commercial establishments outside the home.
>
> The word "laundry" may refer to the clothing itself, 
> or to the place where the cleaning happens. 
> 
> An individual home may have a laundry room; 
> a utility room includes, but is not restricted to, the function of washing clothes. 
> 
> An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a shared laundry facility 
> such as a tvättstuga. 
> 
> A stand-alone business is referred to as a self-service laundry 
> (launderette in British English or laundromat in North American English).
