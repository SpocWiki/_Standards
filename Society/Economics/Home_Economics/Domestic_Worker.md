## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A domestic worker is a person who works within a residence 
> and performs a variety of household services for an individual, 
> from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, 
> or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands. 
> The term "domestic service" applies to the equivalent occupational category. 
> In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be "in service".
>
> Some domestic workers live within their employer's household. 
> In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose 
> work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. 
> 
> However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding 
> and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary. 
> Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, 
> it is often not extensively enforced. 
> In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated 
> and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.
>
> Servant is an older English word for "domestic worker", 
> though not all servants worked inside the home. 
> Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, 
> was sometimes simply called "service" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. 
> 
> In Britain, a highly developed system of domestic service 
> peaked towards the close of the Victorian era 
> (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), 
> perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period 
> which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I.
