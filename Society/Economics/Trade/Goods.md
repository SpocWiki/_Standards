## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In economics, **Goods** are anything that is good, usually in the sense that it provides welfare or utility to someone. Goods can be contrasted with bads, i.e. things that provide negative value for users, like chores or waste. A bad lowers a consumer's overall welfare.
>
> Economics focuses on the study of economic goods, i.e. goods that are scarce; in other words, producing the good requires expending effort or resources. Economic goods contrast with free goods such as air, for which there is an unlimited supply.
>
> Goods are the result of the Secondary sector of the economy which involves the transformation of raw materials or intermediate goods into goods.
