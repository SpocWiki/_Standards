## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In transportation, **Cargo** refers to goods transported by land, water or air, 
> while freight refers to its conveyance. 
> 
> In economics, freight refers to goods transported at a freight rate for commercial gain. 
> The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, 
> because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, 
> even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facilities, including warehouses.
>
> Multi-modal container units, designed as reusable carriers to facilitate unit load handling of the goods contained, are also referred to as cargo, especially by shipping lines and logistics operators. When empty containers are shipped each unit is documented as a cargo and when goods are stored within, the contents are termed containerized cargo. Similarly, aircraft ULD boxes are also documented as cargo, with an associated packing list of the items contained within.
