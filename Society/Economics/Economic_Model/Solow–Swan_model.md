> The Solow–Swan model or exogenous growth model 
> is an economic model of long-run economic growth. 
> 
> It attempts to explain long-run economic growth 
> by looking at capital accumulation, labor or population growth, 
> and increases in productivity largely driven by technological progress. 
> 
> At its core, it is an aggregate production function, often specified to be of Cobb–Douglas type, which enables the model "to make contact with microeconomics". 
> 
> The model was developed independently by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in 1956, 
> and superseded the Keynesian Harrod–Domar model.
>
> Mathematically, the Solow–Swan model is a nonlinear system 
> consisting of a single ordinary differential equation 
> that models the evolution of the per capita stock of capital. 
> 
> Due to its particularly attractive mathematical characteristics, 
> Solow–Swan proved to be a convenient starting point for various extensions. 
> 
> For instance, in 1965, David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans 
> integrated Frank Ramsey's analysis of consumer optimization, 
> thereby endogenizing the saving rate, to create what is now known as the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model.
