> The Bretton Woods system of monetary management 
> established the rules for commercial relations among 44 countries, 
> including the United States, Canada, Western European countries, and Australia, 
> after the 1944 **Bretton Woods Agreement** until the Jamaica Accords in 1976. 
> 
> The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order 
> intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. 
> 
> The Bretton Woods system required countries 
> to guarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S. dollars to within 1% of fixed parity rates, 
> with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks 
> at US$35 per troy ounce of fine gold (or 0.88867 gram fine gold per dollar). 
> 
> It also envisioned greater cooperation among countries 
> in order to prevent future competitive devaluations, 
> and thus established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to monitor exchange rates 
> and lend reserve currencies to countries with balance of payments deficits.
>
> Preparing to rebuild the international economic system while World War II was still being fought, 
> 730 delegates from all 44 Allied countries gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, 
> also known as the Bretton Woods Conference. 
> 
> The delegates deliberated from 1 to 22 July 1944, 
> and signed the Bretton Woods agreement on its final day. 
> Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, 
> these accords established the IMF 
> and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), 
> which today is part of the World Bank Group. 
> 
> The United States, which controlled two-thirds of the world's gold, 
> insisted that the Bretton Woods system rest on both gold and the US dollar. 
> 
> Soviet representatives attended the conference but later declined to ratify the final agreements, 
> charging that the institutions they had created were "branches of Wall Street". 
> 
> These organizations became operational in 1945 
> after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement. 
> According to Barry Eichengreen, the Bretton Woods system operated successfully due to three factors: 
> "low international capital mobility, __tight financial regulation__, 
> and the dominant economic and financial position of the United States and the dollar."
>
> Eurodollar growth increased capital flows, challenging regulation of capital movements. 
> On 15 August 1971, the United States ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold, 
> effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. 
> 
> Shortly thereafter, many fixed currencies (such as the pound sterling) also became free-floating, 
> and the subsequent era has been characterized by floating exchange rates. 
> The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976.
