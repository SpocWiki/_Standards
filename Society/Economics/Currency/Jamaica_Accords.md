> The **Jamaica Accords** were a set of international agreements 
> that ratified the end of the [[Bretton_Woods_Agreement|Bretton Woods monetary system]]. 
> 
> They took the form of recommendations to change the "articles of agreement" 
> that the [[../../../UN(United_Nations)/IMF(International_Monetary_Fund)|International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) was founded upon. 
> The agreement was concluded after meetings by a committee of the board of governors of the IMF, 
> held on 7–8 January 1976 at Kingston, Jamaica.
>
> The accords __allowed the price of gold to float__ with respect to the U.S. dollar and other currencies, 
> albeit within a set of agreed constraints. 
> 
> In practice the dollar had been floating in this way, 
> in contravention of the articles of an agreement of the IMF, since the Nixon shock in 1971. 
> The accords also made provisions for financial assistance to developing countries 
> representing the Group of 77 member countries 
> to compensate for lost earnings from the export of primary commodities. 
> An amendment was made in 1978 to allow for the creation of Special Drawing Rights, 
> described as a low-cost line of credit for developing countries.
