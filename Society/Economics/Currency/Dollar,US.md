> The **United States dollar** (symbol: $ ; currency code: USD; 
> also abbreviated US$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; 
> referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, American dollar, or colloquially buck) 
> is the official currency of the United States and several other countries. 
> The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, 
> divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. 
> U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, 
> popularly called greenbacks due to their predominantly green color.
>
> The U.S. dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of 
> - 371.25 grains (24.057 g) (0.7734375 troy ounces) fine silver 
> - or, from 1834, 23.22 grains (1.505 g) fine gold, or $20.67 per troy ounce. 
> 
> The Gold Standard Act of 1900 linked the dollar solely to gold. 
> From 1934, its equivalence to gold was revised to $35 per troy ounce. 
> In 1971 all links to gold were repealed. 
> 
> The U.S. dollar became an important international reserve currency after the [[../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon-0539~Phanerozoic/Era-0066~Cenozoic/Period-0003~Quaternary/Epoch-000_001~Anthropocene/Modern_History/CE_1900/1914-World_War_I|First World War]], 
> and displaced the pound sterling as the world's primary reserve currency 
> by the [[Bretton_Woods_Agreement]] towards the end of the [[../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon-0539~Phanerozoic/Era-0066~Cenozoic/Period-0003~Quaternary/Epoch-000_001~Anthropocene/Modern_History/CE_1900/1939-World_War_II|Second World War]].

> The dollar is the most widely used currency in international transactions, and a free-floating currency. 
> It is also the official currency in several countries and the de facto currency in many others, 
> with Federal Reserve Notes (and, in a few cases, U.S. coins) used in circulation.
>
> The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System, 
> which acts as the nation's central bank. 
> 
> As of February 10, 2021, currency in circulation amounted to US$2.10 trillion, 
> $2.05 trillion of which is in Federal Reserve Notes 
> (the remaining $50 billion is in the form of coins and older-style United States Notes). 
> As of January 1, 2025, the Federal Reserve estimated that the total amount of currency in circulation 
> was approximately US$2.37 trillion.
