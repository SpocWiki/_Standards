> usually referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations, 
> is a book by the Scottish economist and moral philosopher [[../../Economist/Smith,Adam|Adam Smith]]; 
> published on 9 March 1776, it offers one of the first accounts of what builds nations' wealth. 
> 
> It has become a fundamental work in classical economics, 
> and  been described as "the first formulation of a comprehensive system of political economy". 
> Reflecting upon economics at the beginning of the [[../../_Standards/Time-Ages/human-ages/History/Modern_History/Industrial_Revolution|Industrial Revolution]], 
> Smith introduced key concepts such as the division of labour, productivity, free markets 
> and the role prices play in resource allocation.
> 
> Reflecting upon economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, Smith addresses topics such as the division of labour, productivity, and free markets.
> 
> The book fundamentally shaped the field of economics 
> and provided a theoretical foundation for free market capitalism 
> and economic policies that prevailed in the 19th century. 
> 
> A product of the Scottish Enlightenment and the dawn of the [[../../_Standards/Time-Ages/human-ages/History/Modern_History/Industrial_Revolution|Industrial Revolution]], 
> the treatise offered a critical examination of the mercantilist policies of the day 
> and advocated the implementation of free trade and effective tax policies to drive economic progress. 
> It represented a clear paradigm shift from previous economic thought 
> by proposing that self-interest and the forces of supply and demand, 
> rather than regulation, should determine economic activity.
>
> Smith laid out a system of political economy with the famous 
> metaphor of the "invisible hand" regulating the marketplace through individual self-interest. 
> 
> He provided a comprehensive analysis of different economic aspects – 
> the accumulation of stock, price determination, and the flow of labor, capital, and rent. 
> 
> The book contained Smith's critique of [[Mercantilism]], high taxes on luxury goods, the slave trade, 
> and monopolies, advocating for free competition and open markets. 
> 
> Over revised editions during his lifetime, the work evolved and gained widespread recognition, 
> shaping economic philosophies, government policies, and the intellectual discourse 
> on trade, taxation, and economic growth in the coming centuries.
