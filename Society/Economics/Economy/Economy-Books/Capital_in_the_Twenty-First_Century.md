> **Capital in the Twenty-First Century** (French: Le Capital au XXIe siècle) 
> is a book written by French economist [[Thomas Piketty]]. 
> It focuses on wealth and income inequality in Europe and the United States since the 18th century. 
> It was first published in French (as Le Capital au XXIe siècle) in August 2013; 
> an English translation by Arthur Goldhammer followed in April 2014.
>
> The book's central thesis is that when 
> - the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than 
> - the rate of economic growth (g) over the long term, 
> - the result is concentration of wealth, 
> and this unequal distribution of wealth causes social and economic instability. 
> 
> Piketty proposes a __global system of progressive wealth taxes__ 
> to help reduce inequality and avoid the vast majority of wealth coming under the control of a tiny minority.
>
> At the end of 2014, Piketty released a paper where he stated that 
> he does not consider the relationship between the rate of return on capital 
> and the rate of economic growth as the only or primary tool 
> for considering changes in income and wealth inequality. 
> He also noted that r > g is not a useful tool for the discussion of rising inequality of labor income.
>
> On May 18, 2014, the English edition reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list 
> for best selling hardcover nonfiction and became the greatest sales success ever 
> of academic publisher Harvard University Press. 
> 
> As of January 2015, the book had sold 1.5 million copies in French, English, German, Chinese, and Spanish. 
> The book is a worldwide success, with over 2.5 million copies sold by the end of 2017.
>
> The book was adapted into a feature documentary film, 
> directed by New Zealand filmmaker Justin Pemberton,  and released in 2020.
