> In economics, a **recession** is a business cycle contraction 
> that occurs when there is a period of broad decline in economic activity. 
> 
> Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending 
> (an adverse demand shock). 
> 
> This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, 
> an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, 
> the bursting of an economic bubble, 
> or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). 
> 
> There is no official definition of a recession, 
> according to the International Monetary Fund.
>
> In the United States, a recession is defined as 
> "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, 
> lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, 
> employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales." 
> 
> The European Union has adopted a similar definition. 
> In the United Kingdom and Canada, a recession is defined as 
> negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.
>
> Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply and decreasing interest rates or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.
