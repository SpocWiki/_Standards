## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Econometrics** is an application of statistical methods to economic data 
> in order to give empirical content to economic relationships. 
> 
> More precisely, it is "the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena 
> based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, 
> related by appropriate methods of inference." 
> 
> An introductory economics textbook describes econometrics as 
> allowing economists "to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships." 
> 
> Jan Tinbergen is one of the two founding fathers of econometrics. 
> The other, Ragnar Frisch, also coined the term in the sense in which it is used today.
>
> A basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. 
> Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics 
> to evaluate and develop econometric methods. 
> 
> Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. Applied econometrics uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analysing economic history, and forecasting.
