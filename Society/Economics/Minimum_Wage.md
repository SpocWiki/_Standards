## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A minimum wage is the lowest remuneration 
> that employers can legally pay their employeesâ€”
> the price floor below which employees may not sell their labor. 
> 
> Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation 
> by the end of the 20th century. 
> 
> Because minimum wages increase the cost of labor, 
> companies often try to avoid minimum wage laws by using gig workers, 
> by moving labor to locations with lower or nonexistent minimum wages, 
> or by automating job functions. 
> 
> Minimum wage policies can vary significantly between countries 
> or even within a country, with different regions, sectors, 
> or age groups having their own minimum wage rates. 
> 
> These variations are often influenced by factors such as the cost of living, 
> regional economic conditions, and industry-specific factors.
>
> The movement for minimum wages was first motivated 
> as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in sweatshops, 
> by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. 
> 
> Over time, minimum wages came to be seen as a way to help lower-income families. 
> 
> Modern national laws enforcing compulsory union membership 
> which prescribed minimum wages for their members were first passed in New Zealand in 1894. 
> 
> Although minimum wage laws are now in effect in many jurisdictions, 
> differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. 
> 
> Additionally, minimum wage policies can be implemented through various methods, 
> such as directly legislating specific wage rates, 
> setting a formula that adjusts the minimum wage based on economic indicators, 
> or having wage boards that determine minimum wages 
> in consultation with representatives from employers, employees, and the government.
>
> Supply and demand models 
> suggest that there may be employment losses from minimum wages; 
> however, minimum wages can increase the efficiency of the labor market 
> in monopsony scenarios, where individual employers 
> have a degree of wage-setting power over the market as a whole. 
> 
> Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers, 
> reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. 
> 
> In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty 
> and unemployment because some low-wage workers "will be unable to find work ... [and] will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed".
