> Competition law is the field of law that promotes or seeks to maintain market competition 
> by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies. 
> 
> Competition law is implemented through public and private enforcement. 
> It is also known as antitrust law (or just antitrust), anti-monopoly law, and trade practices law; 
> the act of pushing for antitrust measures or attacking monopolistic companies 
> (known as trusts) is commonly known as trust busting.
>
> The history of competition law reaches back to the Roman Empire. 
> The business practices of market traders, guilds, and governments 
> have always been subject to scrutiny, and sometimes severe sanctions. 
> 
> Since the 20th century, competition law has become global. 
> The two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are 
> United States antitrust law and European Union competition law. 
> 
> National and regional competition authorities across the world 
> have formed international support and enforcement networks.
>
> Modern competition law has historically evolved on a national level 
> to promote and maintain fair competition in markets 
> principally within the territorial boundaries of nation-states. 
> 
> National competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders 
> unless it has significant effects at the nation-state level. 
> 
> Countries may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in competition cases 
> based on so-called "effects doctrine". 
> 
> The protection of international competition 
> is governed by international competition agreements. 
> 
> In 1945, during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the 
> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, 
> limited international competition obligations were proposed 
> within the Charter for an International Trade Organization. 
> 
> These obligations were not included in GATT, 
> but in 1994, with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT multilateral negotiations, 
> the World Trade Organization (WTO) was created. 
> 
> The Agreement Establishing the WTO included a range of limited provisions 
> on various cross-border competition issues on a sector specific basis.
