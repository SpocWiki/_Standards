> Financial economics is the branch of economics 
> characterized by a "concentration on monetary activities", 
> in which "money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade". 
>
> Its concern is thus the interrelation of financial variables, such as share prices, interest rates 
> and exchange rates, as opposed to those concerning the real economy. 
>
> It has two main areas of focus: asset pricing and corporate finance; 
> the first being the perspective of providers of capital, 
> i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital.
>
> It thus provides the theoretical underpinning for much of finance.
>
> The subject is concerned with "the allocation and deployment of economic resources, 
> both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment". 
> 
> It therefore centers on decision making under uncertainty 
> in the context of the financial markets, 
> and the resultant economic and financial models and principles, 
> and is concerned with deriving testable or policy implications from acceptable assumptions. 
>
> It thus also includes a formal study of the financial markets themselves, 
> especially market microstructure and market regulation.
>
> It is built on the foundations of microeconomics and decision theory.
>
> Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics 
> that uses econometric techniques to parameterise the relationships identified.
>
> Mathematical finance is related in that 
> it derives and extends the mathematical/numerical models suggested by financial economics.
>
> Whereas financial economics has a primarily microeconomic focus, 
> monetary economics is primarily macroeconomic in nature.
