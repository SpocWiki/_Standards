> An industrial robot is a robot system used for manufacturing. 
> Industrial robots are automated, programmable 
> and capable of movement on three or more axes.
>
> Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, disassembly, pick and place for printed circuit boards, packaging and labeling, palletizing, product inspection, and testing; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. They can assist in material handling.
>
> In the year 2023, an estimated 4,281,585 industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
