> **Livestock** are the domesticated animals that are raised in an agricultural setting 
> to provide labor and produce diversified products for consumption 
> such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, and wool. 
> 
> The term is sometimes used to refer solely to animals which are raised for consumption, 
> and sometimes used to refer solely to farmed ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. 
> Livestock production are mainly a source for farm work and human consumption. 
>
> The breeding, maintenance, slaughter and general subjugation of livestock called animal husbandry, is a part of modern agriculture and has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Animal husbandry practices have varied widely across cultures and periods. It continues to play a major economic and cultural role in numerous communities.
>
> Livestock farming practices have largely shifted to intensive animal farming. Intensive animal farming increases the yield of the various commercial outputs, but also negatively impacts animal welfare, the environment, and public health. In particular, beef, dairy and sheep are an outsized source of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
