# [[Crop_Rotation]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Crop Rotation** is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops 
> in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. 
> 
> This practice reduces the reliance of crops on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, 
> along with the probability of developing resistant pests and weeds.
>
> Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, 
> gradually depletes the soil of certain nutrients 
> and promotes the proliferation of specialized pest 
> and weed populations adapted to that crop system. 
> 
> Without balancing nutrient use and diversifying pest and weed communities, 
> the productivity of monocultures is highly dependent on external inputs 
> that may be harmful to the soil's fertility. 
> 
> Conversely, a well-designed crop rotation 
> can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides 
> by better using ecosystem services from a diverse set of crops. 
> 
> Additionally, crop rotations can improve soil structure and organic matter, 
> which reduces erosion and increases farm system resilience.
