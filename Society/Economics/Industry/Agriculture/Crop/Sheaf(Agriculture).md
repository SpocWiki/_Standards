> A **Sheaf** (pl.: sheaves) is a bunch of cereal-crop stems bound together after reaping, 
> traditionally by sickle, later by scythe or, 
> after its introduction in 1872, by a mechanical reaper-binder.
>
> Traditional hand-reapers, using scythes and working as a team, 
> cut a field of grain clockwise, starting from an outside edge 
> and finishing in the middle.  
> 
> Scything leaves a windrow of cut stems to the left of the reaper 
> and, if cut skillfully, leaves the seed heads more or less aligned.  
> These are then picked up and tied into sheaves by the sheavers, 
> who traditionally use other cut stems as ties.  
> 
> These sheavers, or a following team, then stand the sheaves up in stooks to dry. 
> Three to eight sheaves make up each stook, 
> which forms a self-supporting A-frame with the grain-heads meeting at the top. 
> This keeps the grain well ventilated, and off the ground 
> allowing it to dry and discouraging vermin.
>
> The drying sheaves are later either placed by hand or pitched onto a cart. 
> 
> The traditional sheaf pitchfork has a long wooden handle, 
> two short tynes and a rounded back to make the placing of sheaves easy. 
> 
> The gathered sheaves are then either built into stacks 
> (thatched stacks could be over 20' high) or taken to a barn for further drying 
> before being threshed to separate the grain from the stems.
>
> The mechanisation of agriculture in industrialised countries, 
> in particular the combine harvester from the middle of the 19th century, 
> has made the sheaf redundant, but sheaves remain in widespread use 
> wherever harvesting is still done by hand or by reaper-binder.
