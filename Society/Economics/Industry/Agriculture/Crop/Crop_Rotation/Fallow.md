# [[Fallow]] 



## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Fallow** is a farming technique in which 
> arable land is left without sowing for one or more vegetative cycles. 
> 
> The goal of fallowing is to allow the land to recover and store organic matter 
> while retaining moisture and disrupting pest life cycles and soil borne pathogens 
> by temporarily removing their hosts. 
> 
> Crop rotation systems typically called for some of a farmer's fields to be left fallow each year.
>
> The increase in intensive farming, including the use of cover crops in lieu of fallow practices, 
> has caused a loss of acreage of fallow land, as well as field margins, hedges, and wasteland. 
> This has reduced biodiversity; fallows have been the primary habitat for farmland bird populations.
