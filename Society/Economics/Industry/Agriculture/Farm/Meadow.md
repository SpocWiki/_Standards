> A **Meadow** ( MED-oh) is an open habitat or field, vegetated by grasses, herbs, and other non-woody plants. 
> Trees or shrubs may sparsely populate meadows, as long as they maintain an open character. 
> Meadows can occur naturally under favourable conditions 
> but are often artificially created from cleared shrub or woodland 
> for the production of hay, fodder or livestock. 
> 
> Meadow habitats as a group are characterized as semi-natural grasslands, 
> meaning that they are largely composed of species native to the region, with only limited human intervention. 
>
> Meadows attract a multitude of wildlife 
> and support flora and fauna that could not thrive in other habitats. 
> They are ecologically important since they provide areas for animal courtship displays, 
> nesting, food gathering, pollinating insects, and sometimes sheltering if the vegetation is high enough. 
> 
> Intensified agricultural practices 
> (too frequent mowing, use of mineral fertilizers, manure and insecticides) 
> may lead to declines in the abundance of organisms and species diversity. 
> 
> There are many types of meadow, including agricultural, transitional, and perpetual – 
> each being a unique and important part of the ecosystem.
>
> Like other biomes, meadows will experience increased pressure (including on their biodiversity) 
> owing to climate change, especially as precipitation and weather conditions change. 
> However grasslands and meadows also have an important climate change mitigation potential 
> as carbon sinks:  deep-rooted grasses store a substantial amount of carbon in soil.
