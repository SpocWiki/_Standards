## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Orchard** is an intentional plantation of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. 
> 
> Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees that are generally grown for commercial production. 
> Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, 
> where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. 
> 
> A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, 
> although it is set on a smaller, non-commercial scale 
> and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. 
> 
> Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, 
> with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy.
>
> Most modern commercial orchards are planted for a single variety of fruit. 
> While the importance of introducing biodiversity is recognized in forest plantations, 
> introducing genetic diversity in orchard plantations by interspersing other trees might offer benefits. 
> Genetic diversity in an orchard would provide resilience to pests and diseases, just as in forests.
>
> Orchards are sometimes concentrated near bodies of water 
> where climatic extremes are moderated and blossom time is retarded until frost danger is past.
