> A grain elevator or grain terminal is a facility designed to stockpile or store grain. 
> In the grain trade, the term "grain elevator" also describes 
> a tower containing a bucket elevator or a pneumatic conveyor, 
> which scoops up grain from a lower level and deposits it in a silo or other storage facility.
>
> In most cases, the term "grain elevator" also describes the entire elevator complex, 
> including receiving and testing offices, weighbridges, and storage facilities. 
> It may also mean organizations that operate or control several individual elevators, 
> in different locations. 
> 
> In Australia, the term describes only the lifting mechanism. 
>
> Before the advent of the grain elevator, grain was usually handled in bags 
> rather than in bulk (large quantities of loose grain). 
> The Dart elevator was a major innovation—it was invented by Joseph Dart, 
> a merchant, and Robert Dunbar, an engineer, in 1842, in Buffalo, New York. 
> Using the steam-powered flour mills of Oliver Evans as their model, 
> they invented the marine leg, which scooped loose grain out of the hulls of ships 
> and elevated it to the top of a marine tower.
>
> Early grain elevators and bins were often built of framed or cribbed wood, 
> and were prone to fire. 
> 
> In 1899 Frank H. Peavey 'The Elevator King' along with Charles F. Haglin, 
> invented the modern grain elevator. 
> The first Peavey-Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator 
> still stands today in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. 
> The Peavey invented elevator was the first cylindrical concrete grain elevator in the world 
> and is now widely used across Canada and the US.  
>
> Grain elevator bins, tanks, and silos are now usually made of steel or reinforced concrete. 
> Bucket elevators are used to lift grain to a distributor or consignor, 
> from which it falls through spouts and/or conveyors 
> and into one or more bins, silos, or tanks in a facility. 
> 
> When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers, and conveyors. 
> As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos, it is conveyed, blended, 
> and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges for shipment.
