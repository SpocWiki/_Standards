> **Hay** is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut and dried 
> to be stored for use as animal fodder, either for large grazing animals raised as livestock, 
> such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep, 
> or for smaller domesticated animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. 
> Pigs can eat hay, but do not digest it as efficiently as herbivores do.
>
> Hay can be used as animal fodder when or where there is not enough pasture 
> or rangeland on which to graze an animal, when grazing is not feasible due to weather 
> (such as during the winter), or when lush pasture by itself would be too rich 
> for the health of the animal. 
> 
> It is also fed when an animal cannot access any pasturesâ€”
> for example, when the animal is being kept in a stable or barn.
>
> Hay production and harvest, commonly known as "making hay", "haymaking", "haying" 
> or "doing hay", involves a multiple step process: cutting, drying or "curing", 
> raking, processing, and storing. 
> 
> Hayfields do not have to be reseeded each year in the way that grain crops are, 
> but regular fertilizing is usually desirable, and overseeding a field every few years 
> helps increase yield.
