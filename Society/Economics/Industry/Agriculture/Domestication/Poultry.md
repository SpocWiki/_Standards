> **Poultry** () are domesticated birds kept by humans 
> for the purpose of harvesting animal products such as meat, eggs or feathers. 
> 
> The practice of raising poultry is known as poultry farming. 
> These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), 
> especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails, and turkeys). 
> 
> The term also includes waterfowls of the family Anatidae (ducks and geese) 
> but does not include wild birds hunted for food known as game or quarry.
>
> Recent genomic studies involving the four extant junglefowl species reveals 
> that the domestication of chicken, the most populous poultry species, 
> occurred around 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. 
> 
> This was previously believed to have occurred around 5,400 years ago, also in Southeast Asia. 
> The process may have originally occurred as a result of 
> people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, 
> but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. 
> 
> Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first 
> and quail kept for their songs, but people soon realised the advantages 
> of having a captive-bred source of food. 
> 
> Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility 
> took place over the centuries, and modern breeds 
> often look very different from their wild ancestors. 
> 
> Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, 
> most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises.
>
> Together with pork, poultry is one of the two most widely-eaten types of meat globally, 
> with over 70% of the meat supply in 2012 between them; 
> poultry provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein 
> accompanied by a low proportion of fat. 
> 
> All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked 
> in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning. 
> 
> Semi-vegetarians who consume poultry as the only source of meat 
> are said to adhere to pollotarianism.
