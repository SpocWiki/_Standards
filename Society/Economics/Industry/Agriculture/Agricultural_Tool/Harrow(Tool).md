> In agriculture, a harrow is a farm implement used for surface tillage. 
> It is used after ploughing  for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil. 
> The purpose of harrowing is to break up clods and 
> to provide a soil structure, called tilth, that is suitable for planting seeds. 
> Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing.
>
> Harrows differ from ploughs, which cut the upper 12 to 25 centimetre (5 to 10 in) layer of soil, 
> and leave furrows, parallel trenches. 
> Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, 
> while a cultivator instead disturbs only narrow tracks between the crop rows to kill weeds.
>
> There are four general types of harrows: 
> - disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), 
> - chain harrows, and 
> - chain-disk harrows. 
> 
> Harrows were originally drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, 
> or in some times and places by manual labourers. 
> 
> In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, 
> either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.
>
> A modern development of the traditional harrow is the rotary power harrow, 
> often just called a power harrow.
