> The roller is an agricultural tool used for flattening land 
> or breaking up large clumps of soil, especially after ploughing or disc harrowing. 
> 
> Typically, rollers are pulled by tractors or, prior to mechanisation, 
> a team of animals such as horses or oxen. 
> As well as for agricultural purposes, 
> rollers are used on cricket pitches and residential lawn areas.
>
> Flatter land makes subsequent weed control and harvesting easier, 
> and rolling can help to reduce moisture loss from cultivated soil.  
> On lawns, rolling levels the land for mowing and compacts the soil surface.
>
> Rollers may be weighted in different ways. For many uses a heavy roller is used. These may consist of one or more cylinders made of thick steel, a thinner steel cylinder filled with concrete, or a cylinder filled with water.  A water-filled roller has the advantage that the water may be drained out for lighter use or for transport.  In frost-prone areas a water filled roller must be drained for winter storage to avoid breakage due to the expansion for water as it turns to ice.
