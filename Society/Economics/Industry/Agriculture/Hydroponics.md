> **Hydroponics** is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture 
> which involves growing plants, usually crops or medicinal plants, without soil, 
> by using water-based mineral nutrient solutions in an artificial environment. 
> 
> Terrestrial or aquatic plants may grow freely 
> with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid 
> or the roots may be mechanically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.
>
> Despite inert media, roots can cause changes of the rhizosphere pH 
> and root exudates can affect rhizosphere biology 
> and physiological balance of the nutrient solution 
> when secondary metabolites are produced in plants. 
> 
> Transgenic plants grown hydroponically allow the release of pharmaceutical proteins 
> as part of the root exudate into the hydroponic medium.
>
> The nutrients used in hydroponic systems can come from many different sources, 
> including fish excrement, duck manure, purchased chemical fertilizers, 
> or artificial standard or hybrid nutrient solutions.
>
> In contrast to field cultivation, plants are commonly grown hydroponically 
> in a greenhouse or contained environment on inert media, 
> adapted to the controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) process. 
> 
> Plants commonly grown hydroponically include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries, lettuces, and cannabis, usually for commercial use, 
> as well as Arabidopsis thaliana, which serves as a model organism in plant science and genetics.
>
> Hydroponics offers many advantages, notably a decrease in water usage in agriculture. 
> To grow 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of tomatoes using
> - 214 liters with intensive farming methods requires (47 imp gal; 57 U.S. gal) of water;
> - 70 liters using hydroponics (15 imp gal; 18 U.S. gal); and
> - 20 liters (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 U.S. gal) using [[Aeroponics]].
>
> Hydroponic cultures lead to highest biomass and protein production compared to other growth substrates, of plants cultivated in the same environmental conditions and supplied with equal amounts of nutrients.
>
> Hydroponics is not only used on earth, but has also proven itself in plant production experiments in Earth orbit.
