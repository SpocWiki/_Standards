> A **Farm** (also called an agricultural holding) is an area of land 
> that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes 
> with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; 
> it is the basic facility in food production. 
> 
> The name is used for specialized units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig 
> and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fiber, biofuel, and other biobased products. 
> 
> It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings, and hobby farms, 
> and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. 
> 
> In modern times, the term has been extended to 
> include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms.
>
> There are about 570 million farms in the world, most of which are small and family-operated. Small farms with a land area of fewer than 2 hectares operate on about 12% of the world's agricultural land, and family farms comprise about 75% of the world's agricultural land.
>
> Modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized. In the United States, livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots, and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed. In Europe, traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units. In Australia, some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions. In less developed countries, small farms are the norm, and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers, feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market.
