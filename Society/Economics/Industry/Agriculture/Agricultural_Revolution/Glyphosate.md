## Detergents as a Source of  Glyphosate 

[[Phosphonate]]s can be a source of [[Glyphosate]]-compounds. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Glyphosate** (IUPAC name: N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum 
> systemic herbicide and crop desiccant. 
> 
> It is an organophosphorus compound, specifically a phosphonate, 
> which acts by inhibiting the plant enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP). 
> Glyphosate-based herbicides are used to kill weeds, 
> especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. 
> Monsanto brought it to market for agricultural use in 1974 under the trade name Roundup. 
> Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent expired in 2000.
>
> Farmers quickly adopted glyphosate for agricultural weed control, 
> especially after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops, 
> enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. 
> 
> In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector 
> and the second-most used (after 2,4-D) in home and garden, government and industry, 
> and commercial applications. 
> From the late 1970s to 2016, there was a 100-fold increase in the frequency 
> and volume of application of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide, 
> with further increases expected in the future.
>
> Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage, and minimally through roots, 
> and from there translocated to growing points. 
> It inhibits EPSP synthase, 
> a plant enzyme involved in the synthesis of three aromatic amino acids: 
> - tyrosine, 
> - tryptophan, and 
> - phenylalanine. 
> 
> It is therefore effective only on actively growing plants 
> and is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. 
> 
> Crops have been genetically engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate 
> (e.g. Roundup Ready soybean, the first Roundup Ready crop, also created by Monsanto), 
> which allows farmers to use glyphosate as a post-emergence herbicide against weeds.
>
> While glyphosate and formulations such as Roundup 
> have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, 
> concerns about their effects on humans and the environment have persisted. 
> 
> A number of regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated 
> the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. 
> 
> The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 
> stating the use of glyphosate formulations does not necessarily constitute a health risk, 
> and giving an acceptable daily intake limit of 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight 
> per day for chronic toxicity.
>
> The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is 
> that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. 
> 
> In March 2015, the World Health Organization's 
> International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 
> classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic in humans" (category 2A) 
> based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies.  
> 
> In contrast, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in November 2015 that 
> "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) 
> or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans", later clarifying that 
> while carcinogenic glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, 
> studies that "look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect". 
> 
> In 2017, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) 
> classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage and as toxic to aquatic life 
> but did not find evidence implicating it as a carcinogen, a mutagen, 
> toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.
