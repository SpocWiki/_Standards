> A **Pitchfork** or hay fork is an agricultural tool used to pitch loose material, such as 
> hay, straw, manure, or leaves. 
> It has a long handle and usually two to five thin tines 
> designed to efficiently move such materials.
>
> The term is also applied colloquially, but inaccurately, to the garden fork. 
> While similar in appearance, the garden fork is shorter and stockier than the pitchfork, 
> with three or four thicker tines intended for turning or loosening the soil of gardens.
