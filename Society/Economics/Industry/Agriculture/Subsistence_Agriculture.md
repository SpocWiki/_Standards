> Subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow crops on smallholdings 
> to meet the needs of themselves and their families. 
> 
> Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and mostly for local requirements. 
> 
> Planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward 
> what the family will need during the coming year, and only secondarily toward market prices. 
> 
> Tony Waters, a professor of sociology, defines "subsistence peasants" as 
> "people who grow what they eat, build their own houses, 
> and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace".
>
> Despite the self-sufficiency in subsistence farming, 
> most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree. 
> 
> Although their amount of trade as measured in cash is 
> less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets, 
> they use these markets mainly to obtain goods, not to generate income for food; 
> these goods are typically not necessary for survival 
> and may include sugar, iron roofing-sheets, bicycles, used clothing, and so forth.  
> 
> Many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce 
> because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace.
>
> Subsistence farming today is most common in developing countries. 
> Subsistence agriculture generally features: small capital/finance requirements, 
> mixed cropping, limited use of agrochemicals (e.g. pesticides and fertilizer), 
> unimproved varieties of crops and animals, little or no surplus yield for sale, 
> use of crude, traditional tools (e.g. hoes, machetes, and cutlasses), 
> mainly the production of crops, small scattered plots of land, 
> reliance on inexperienced or untrained labor (often family members), and (generally) low yields.
