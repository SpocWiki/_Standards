> The **green revolution**, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, was a period during which 
> technology transfer initiatives resulted in a significant increase in crop yields. 
> 
> These changes in agriculture initially emerged in developed countries in the early 20th century 
> and subsequently spread globally until the late 1980s. 
> In the late 1960s, farmers began incorporating new technologies, 
> including high-yielding varieties of cereals, particularly dwarf wheat and rice, 
> and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers (to produce their high yields, 
> the new seeds require far more fertilizer than traditional varieties), pesticides, and controlled irrigation. 
>
> At the same time, newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization, were adopted, 
> often as a package of practices to replace traditional agricultural technology. 
> This was often in conjunction with 
> loans conditional on policy changes being made by the developing nations adopting them, 
> such as privatizing fertilizer manufacture and distribution.
>
> Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation 
> were heavily involved in its initial development in Mexico. 
> 
> A key leader was agricultural scientist [[Borlaug,Norman]], the "Father of the Green Revolution", 
> who received the [[../../../Agent/Community/Organization/International_Organization/NGO(non-governmental_organization)/Nobel_Prize/Peace_Nobel_Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1970. 
> He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. 
> 
> Another important scientific figure was [[Yuan Longping]], 
> whose work on hybrid rice varieties is credited with saving at least as many lives. 
> 
> The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, 
> expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, 
> distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers. 
> 
> As crops began to reach the maximum improvement possible through selective breeding, 
> genetic modification technologies were developed to allow for continued efforts.
>
> Studies show that the Green Revolution contributed to widespread eradication of poverty, 
> averted hunger for millions, raised incomes, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, 
> reduced land use for agriculture, and contributed to declines in infant mortality.
