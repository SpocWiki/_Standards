> **Mechanization** (or mechanisation) is the process of changing 
> from working largely or exclusively by hand or with animals 
> to doing that work with machinery.  
> 
> In an early engineering text, a machine is defined as follows:
>
> Every machine is constructed for the purpose of performing certain mechanical operations, 
> each of which supposes the existence of two other things besides the machine in question, 
> namely, a moving power, and an object subject to the operation, 
> which may be termed the work to be done.
>
> Machines, in fact, are interposed between the power and the work, 
> for the purpose of adapting the one to the other.
>
> In every fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. 
> 
> In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, 
> mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools 
> and would not include simple devices such as an ungeared horse or donkey mill. Devices 
> that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, 
> using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, 
> usually are considered machines.  
> 
> After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, 
> mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines. 
> 
> Extension of mechanization of the production process is termed as automation 
> and it is controlled by a closed loop system in which feedback is provided by the sensors. 
> In an automated machine the work of different mechanisms is performed automatically.
