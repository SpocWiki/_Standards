> A **Factory**, manufacturing plant or production plant is an industrial facility, 
> often a complex consisting of several buildings filled with machinery, 
> where workers manufacture items or operate machines which process each item into another. 
> They are a critical part of modern economic production, 
> with the majority of the world's goods being created or processed within factories.
>
> Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution, 
> when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops. 
> Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules, 
> and fewer than a dozen workers have been called "glorified workshops".
>
> Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities 
> that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. 
> Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, 
> some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. 
> In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a "Shed".
>
> Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, 
> such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. 
> Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants 
> and may have most of their equipment – tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping – 
> outdoors and operated from control rooms. 
> Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors.
>
> Discrete products may be final goods, or parts and sub-assemblies 
> which are made into final products elsewhere. 
> Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials. 
> Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity 
> to transform streams of raw materials into finished products.
>
> The term mill originally referred to the milling of grain, 
> which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power 
> until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century. 
> 
> Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing 
> were originally powered by water, the term survives as in steel mill, paper mill, etc.
