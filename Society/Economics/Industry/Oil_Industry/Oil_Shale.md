> Oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock 
> containing kerogen (a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds) 
> from which liquid hydrocarbons can be produced. 
> 
> In addition to kerogen, oil shales contain inorganic substances and bitumen. 
> Based on their deposition environment, oil shales are classified as 
> marine, lacustrine and terrestrial oil shales. 
> 
> Oil shales differ from oil-bearing shales, shale deposits that contain petroleum (tight oil) 
> that is sometimes produced from drilled wells. 
> Examples of oil-bearing shales are the 
> Bakken Formation, Pierre Shale, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation. 
> Accordingly, shale oil produced from oil shale should not be confused with tight oil, 
> which is also frequently called shale oil.
>
> A 2016 estimate of global deposits set the total world resources of oil shale 
> equivalent of 6.05 trillion barrels (962 billion cubic metres) of oil in place. 
> Oil shale has gained attention as a potential abundant source of oil. 
> 
> However, the various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have had limited success. 
> Only Estonia and China have well-established oil shale industries, 
> and Brazil, Germany, and Russia  utilize oil shale to some extent.
>
> Oil shale can be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel 
> for power generation and district heating 
> or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing. 
> 
> Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature 
> causes the chemical process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor. 
> 
> Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil, is separated from combustible oil-shale gas. 
> Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; 
> however, extracting shale oil is costlier than the production of conventional crude oil 
> both financially and in terms of its environmental impact. 
> 
> Oil-shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns, such as 
> land use, waste disposal, water use, waste-water management, greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution.
