## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An oil refinery or petroleum refinery is an industrial process plant 
> where petroleum (crude oil) is transformed and refined into products such as 
> gasoline (petrol), diesel fuel, asphalt base, fuel oils, heating oil, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and petroleum naphtha. 
> 
> Petrochemical feedstock like ethylene and propylene can also be produced directly 
> by cracking crude oil without the need of using refined products of crude oil such as naphtha. 
> 
> The crude oil feedstock has typically been processed by an oil production plant. 
> There is usually an oil depot at or near an oil refinery for the storage of incoming crude oil 
> as well as bulk liquid products. 
> 
> In 2020, the total capacity of global refineries for crude oil was about 101.2 million barrels per day.
>
> Oil refineries are typically large, sprawling industrial complexes 
> with extensive piping running throughout, 
> carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units, such as distillation columns. 
> 
> In many ways, oil refineries use many different technologies 
> and can be thought of as types of chemical plants. 
> 
> Since December 2008, the world's largest oil refinery has been the Jamnagar Refinery 
> owned by Reliance Industries, located in Gujarat, India, 
> with a processing capacity of 1.24 million barrels (197,000 m3) per day.
>
> Oil refineries are an essential part of the petroleum industry's downstream sector.
