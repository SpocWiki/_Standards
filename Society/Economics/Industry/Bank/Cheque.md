> A **Cheque** (or check in American English) is a document that orders a bank, building society, 
> or credit union, to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account 
> to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued. 
> 
> The person writing the cheque, known as the drawer, has a transaction banking account 
> (often called a current, cheque, chequing, checking, or share draft account) 
> where the money is held. 
> The drawer writes various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the cheque, 
> and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the drawee, 
> to pay the amount of money stated to the payee.
>
> Although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, 
> they became a highly popular non-cash method for making payments during the 20th century 
> and usage of cheques peaked. 
> 
> By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, 
> billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s. 
> Since then cheque usage has fallen, being replaced by electronic payment systems, 
> such as debit cards and credit cards. 
> 
> In an increasing number of countries cheques have either become a marginal payment system 
> or have been completely phased out.
