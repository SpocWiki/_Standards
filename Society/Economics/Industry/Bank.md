> A **Bank** is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public 
> and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans. 
> Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.
>
> As banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, 
> most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. 
> Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional-reserve banking, 
> under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. 
> In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, 
> banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements 
> based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.
>
> Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century 
> in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy 
> but, in many ways, functioned as a continuation of 
> ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. 
> 
> In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties notably, 
> - the Medicis, 
> - the Pazzi, 
> - the Fuggers, 
> - the Welsers, 
> - the Berenbergs, and 
> - the Rothschilds â€“  
> have played a central role over many centuries. 
> The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), 
> while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).
