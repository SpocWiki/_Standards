> The **petroleum industry**, also known as the oil industry, 
> includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, 
> transportation (often by oil tankers and pipelines), 
> and marketing of petroleum products. 
> 
> The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). 
> Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including 
> pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic fragrances, and plastics.  
> 
> The industry is usually divided into three major components: 
> upstream, midstream, and downstream. Upstream regards exploration and extraction of crude oil, midstream encompasses transportation and storage of it, and downstream concerns refining crude oil into various end products.
>
> Petroleum is vital to many industries, and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration, making it a critical concern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world's energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia, to a high of 53% for the Middle East.
>
> Other geographic regions' consumption patterns are as follows: South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). The world consumes 36 billion barrels (5.8 km3) of oil per year, with developed nations being the largest consumers. The United States consumed 18% of the oil produced in 2015. The production, distribution, refining, and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world's largest industry in terms of dollar value.
