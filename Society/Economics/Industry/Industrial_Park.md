> An industrial park, also known as industrial estate or trading estate, 
> is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development. 
> 
> An industrial park can be thought of as a more heavyweight version of 
> a business park or office park, which has offices and light industry, 
> rather than heavy industry. 
> 
> Industrial parks are notable for being relatively simple to build; 
> they often feature speedily erected single-space steel sheds, occasionally in bright colours.
