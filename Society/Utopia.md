## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Utopia** (yoo-TOH-pee-ə) typically describes an imagined community or society 
> that possesses highly desirable or near-perfect qualities for its members. 
> 
> It was coined by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book Utopia, 
> which describes a fictional island society in the New World.
>
> Hypothetical utopias and actually-existing utopian intentional communities focus on, 
> among other things, equality in categories such as economics, government and justice, 
> with the method and structure of proposed implementation varying according to ideology. 
> 
> Lyman Tower Sargent argues that the nature of a utopia is inherently contradictory 
> because societies are not homogeneous. 
> Their members have desires that conflict and therefore cannot simultaneously be satisfied. 
> 
> To quote:
> There are socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left-wing, right-wing, reformist, free love, nuclear family, extended family, gay, lesbian and many more utopias [ Naturism, Nude Christians, ...] 
> Utopianism, some argue, is essential for the improvement of the human condition. 
> But if used wrongly, it becomes dangerous. 
> Utopia has an inherent contradictory nature here.
> 
> The opposite of a utopia is a dystopia. 
> Utopian and dystopian fiction has become a popular literary category. 
> Despite being common parlance for something imaginary, 
> utopianism inspired and was inspired by some reality-based fields and concepts such as 
> architecture, file sharing, social networks, universal basic income, communes, open borders and even pirate bases.
