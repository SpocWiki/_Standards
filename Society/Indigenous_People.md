## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> There is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples, 
> although in the 21st century the focus has been on self-identification, 
> cultural difference from other groups in a state, 
> a special relationship with their traditional territory, 
> and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.
>
> Estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250 million to 600 million. 
> There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous peoples 
> spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited continent of the world. 
> 
> Most Indigenous peoples are in a minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous peoples. Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced colonization by settlers from European nations, Indigenous identity is not determined by Western colonization.
>
> The rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined 
> in national legislation, treaties and international law. 
> The 1989 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 
> on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects Indigenous peoples 
> from discrimination and specifies their rights to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources, employment, education and health. 
> 
> In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
> including their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health, education and natural resources.
>
> Indigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the resources on which their cultures depend. 
> 
> In the 21st century, Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples 
> have highlighted numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.
