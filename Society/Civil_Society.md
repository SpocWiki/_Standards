> Civil society can be understood as the "third sector" of society, 
> distinct from [[Politics/Government|Government]] and [[Agent/Organization/Business|Business]], and including the family and the private sphere. 
> By other authors, civil society is used in the sense of
> (1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that advance the interests and will of citizens or
> (2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.
>
> Sometimes the term civil society is used in the more general sense of "the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society" (Collins English Dictionary). Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.
