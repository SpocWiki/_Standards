> A trust is a legal relationship in which 
> - the owner of property, or any transferable right, gives it to another to manage and use solely for the benefit of a designated person. 
> In the English common law, 
> - the party who entrusts the property is known as the "settlor," 
> - the party to whom it is entrusted is known as the "trustee," 
> - the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the "beneficiary," 
> - and the entrusted property is known as the "corpus" or "trust property." 
> A testamentary trust is an irrevocable trust established and funded pursuant to the terms of a deceased person's will.  
> An inter vivos trust is a trust created during the settlor's life.
>
> The trustee is the legal owner of the assets held in trust on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries. 
> The beneficiaries are equitable owners of the trust property. 
> 
> Trustees have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust for the benefit of the equitable owners. 
> Trustees must provide regular accountings of trust income and expenditures. 
> 
> A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches their duty. 
> Some breaches can be charged and tried as criminal offenses. 
> A trustee can be a natural person, business entity or public body. 
> 
> A trust in the US may be subject to federal and state taxation. 
> The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role. For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.
