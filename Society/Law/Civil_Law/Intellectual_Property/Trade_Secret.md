> A **Trade Secret** is information that a business keeps confidential to maintain a competitive advantage. 
> Well-known examples include the Coca-Cola formula and the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
>
> Unlike other forms of intellectual property, trade secrets do not require formal registration 
> and can be protected indefinitely, as long as they remain undisclosed. 
> Instead, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), among other measures, 
> are commonly used to keep the information secret. 
>
> Like other IP assets, trade secrets may be sold or licensed. 
> Unauthorized acquisition, use, or disclosure of a trade secret by others 
> in a manner contrary to honest commercial 
> practices is considered misappropriation of the trade secret. 
> 
> If trade secret misappropriation happens, the trade secret holder can seek various legal remedies.
