## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Copyright infringement (at times referred to as piracy) is the use of works protected by copyright 
> without permission for a usage where such permission is required, 
> thereby infringing certain exclusive rights granted to the copyright holder, 
> such as the right to reproduce, distribute, display or perform the protected work, 
> or to produce derivative works. 
> 
> The copyright holder is usually the work's creator, or a publisher 
> or other business to whom copyright has been assigned. 
> Copyright holders routinely invoke legal and technological measures 
> to prevent and penalize copyright infringement.
>
> Copyright infringement disputes are usually resolved through direct negotiation, 
> a notice and take down process, or litigation in civil court. 
> 
> Egregious or large-scale commercial infringement, 
> especially when it involves counterfeiting, or the fraudulent imitation of a product or brand,  
> is sometimes prosecuted via the criminal justice system. 
> 
> Shifting public expectations, advances in digital technology 
> and the increasing reach of the Internet have led to such widespread, anonymous infringement 
> that copyright-dependent industries now focus less on pursuing individuals 
> who seek and share copyright-protected content online, 
> and more on expanding copyright law to recognize and penalize, as indirect infringers, 
> the service providers and software distributors 
> who are said to facilitate and encourage individual acts of infringement by others.
>
> Estimates of the actual economic impact of copyright infringement vary widely and depend on other factors. 
> Nevertheless, copyright holders, industry representatives, 
> and legislators have long characterized copyright infringement as piracy or theft – 
> language which some U.S. courts now regard as pejorative or otherwise contentious.
