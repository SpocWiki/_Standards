# [[Ownership]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Ownership** is the state or fact of legal possession and control over property, which may be any asset, tangible or intangible. 
> Ownership can involve multiple rights, collectively referred to as title, which may be separated and held by different parties.
>
> The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain, transfer, and lose ownership of property in a number of ways. 
> To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, win it in a bet, receive it as a gift, inherit it, find it, receive it as damages, earn it by doing work or performing services, make it, or homestead it. 
> One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other property, giving it as a gift, misplacing it, or having it stripped from one's ownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking. 
> Ownership implies that the owner of a property also owns any economic benefits or deficits associated with the property.
