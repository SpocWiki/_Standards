## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Salic law (Latin: Lex salica), also called the Salian law, 
> was the ancient Frankish civil law code compiled around AD 500 by Clovis, 
> the first Frankish king. 
> 
> The name may refer to the Salii, or "Salian Franks", but this is debated. 
> The written text is in Late Latin, and contains some of the earliest known instances of Old Dutch. 
> 
> It remained the basis of Frankish law throughout the early medieval period, 
> and influenced future European legal systems. 
> 
> The best-known tenet of the old law is the principle of 
> exclusion of women from inheritance of thrones, fiefs, and other property. 
> 
> The Salic laws were arbitrated by a committee 
> appointed and empowered by the king of the Franks. 
> 
> Dozens of manuscripts dating from the sixth to eighth centuries and three emendations as late as the ninth century have survived.
>
> Salic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing inheritance, and criminal law, such as the punishment for murder. Although it was originally intended as the law of the Franks, it has had a formative influence on the tradition of statute law that extended to modern history in much of Europe, especially in the German states and Austria-Hungary in Central Europe, the Low Countries in  Western Europe, Balkan kingdoms in Southeastern Europe, and parts of Italy and Spain in Southern Europe. Its use of agnatic succession governed the succession of kings in kingdoms such as France and Italy.
