## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Injunction** is an equitable remedy in the form of a special court order 
> compelling a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts. 
> It was developed by the English courts of equity 
> but its origins go back to Roman law and the equitable remedy of the "interdict".
>
> "When a court employs the extraordinary remedy of injunction, 
> it directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers." 
> A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or civil penalties, 
> including possible monetary sanctions and even imprisonment. 
> They can also be charged with contempt of court.
