> Habeas corpus is a legal procedure invoking the jurisdiction of a court 
> to review the unlawful detention or imprisonment of an individual, 
> and request the individual's custodian (usually a prison official) to bring the prisoner to court, 
> to determine whether their detention is lawful. 
> 
> The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
> has long been celebrated as a fundamental safeguard of individual liberty.
>
> Habeas corpus is generally enforced via writ, and accordingly referred to as a writ of habeas corpus. 
> The writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "common law", 
> or "prerogative writs", which were historically issued by the English courts 
> in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. 
> The writ was a legal mechanism that allowed a court to exercise jurisdiction 
> and guarantee the rights of all the Crown's subjects against arbitrary arrest and detention.
>
> At common law the burden was usually on the official to prove that a detention was authorized. 
>
> Habeas corpus has certain limitations. 
> In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended 
> on the basis of a war or state of emergency, 
> for example with the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1794 in Britain, 
> and the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863) in the United States.
