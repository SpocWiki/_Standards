> **International law**, also known as public international law and the law of nations, 
> is the set of 
> - rules, 
> - norms, 
> - legal customs and standards 
> that states and other actors feel an obligation to, and generally do, 
> obey in their mutual relations. 
> 
> In international relations, actors are simply the individuals and collective entities, 
> such as states, international organizations, and non-state groups, 
> which can make behavioral choices, whether lawful or unlawful. 
> 
> Rules are formal, typically written expectations that outline required behavior, 
> while norms are informal, often unwritten guidelines about appropriate behavior 
> that are shaped by custom and social practice. 
> It establishes norms for states across a broad range of domains, 
> including war and diplomacy, economic relations, and human rights. 
>
> International law differs from state-based domestic legal systems in that 
> it operates largely through consent, 
> since there is no universally accepted authority to enforce it upon sovereign states. 
> 
> States and non-state actors may choose to not abide by international law, 
> and even to breach a treaty, but such violations, particularly of peremptory norms, 
> can be met with disapproval by others and in some cases coercive action 
> including diplomacy, economic sanctions, and war. 
> 
> The lack of a final authority in international law can also cause far reaching differences. 
> This is partly the effect of states being able to interpret international law 
> in a manner which they see fit. 
> This can lead to problematic stances which can have large local effects.
>
> The sources of international law include customary international law 
> (general state practice accepted as law), treaties, and general principles of law 
> recognised by most national legal systems. 
> 
> Although international law may also be reflected in international comity—
> the practices adopted by states to maintain good relations and mutual recognition—
> such traditions are not legally binding. 
> 
> Since good relations are more important to maintain with more powerful states 
> they can influence others more in the matter of what is legal and what is not. 
> This is because they can impose heavier consequences on other states 
> which gives them a final say. 
> 
> The relationship and interaction between a national legal system and international law 
> is complex and variable. 
> 
> National law may become international law 
> when treaties permit national jurisdiction to supranational tribunals 
> such as the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court. 
> 
> **Treaties such as the Geneva Conventions** 
> **require national law to conform to treaty provisions**. 
> National laws or constitutions may also provide for 
> the implementation or integration of international legal obligations into domestic law.
