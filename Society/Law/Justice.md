## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In its broadest sense, **Justice** is the idea that individuals should be treated fairly. 
> According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 
> the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, 
> a 6th-century codification of Roman law, 
> where justice is defined as "the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due".
>
> A society where justice has been achieved would be one 
> in which individuals receive what they "deserve". 
> 
> The interpretation of what "deserve" means draws on a variety of fields 
> and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. 
> The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings.
