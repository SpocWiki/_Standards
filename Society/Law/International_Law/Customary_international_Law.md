> **Customary international law** consists of international legal obligations 
> arising from established or usual international practices, 
> which are less formal customary expectations of behavior 
> often unwritten as opposed to formal written treaties or conventions. 
> 
> Generally, customary international law applies equally to all states. 
> Along with general principles of law and treaties, 
> custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, 
> and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law.  
>
> Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, 
> although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it. 
> A rule becomes customary international law if two requirements are met: 
> (1) There is a state practice that "appears to be sufficiently widespread, representative as well as consistent" showing that a significant number of states have used and relied on the rule in question and the concept has not been rejected by a significant number of states, and 
> (2) states are motivated by a belief that they are legally compelled to accept the legitimacy of the rule in question because a rule of customary law obligates them to do so (opinio juris).
>
> In 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources 
> as forms of evidence of customary international law: 
> - treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations. 
> In 2018, the Commission adopted 
> Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law with commentaries. 
> The United Nations General Assembly welcomed the Conclusions 
> and encouraged their widest possible dissemination.
