## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Treaty** is a formal, legally binding written agreement 
> between sovereign states and/or international organizations 
> that is governed by international law. 
> 
> A treaty may also be known as an international agreement, protocol, covenant, convention, pact, or exchange of letters, among other terms; 
> however, only documents that are legally binding on the parties 
> are considered treaties under international law. 
> Treaties may be bilateral (between two countries) 
> or multilateral (involving more than two countries). 
>
> Treaties are among the earliest manifestations of international relations; 
> the first known example is a border agreement 
> between the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma around 3100 BC. 
> International agreements were used in some form by most major civilizations 
> and became increasingly common and more sophisticated during the early modern era. 
> The early 19th century saw developments in diplomacy, foreign policy, and international law 
> reflected by the widespread use of treaties. 
> 
> The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) codified these practices 
> and established rules and guidelines for 
> creating, amending, interpreting, and terminating treaties, 
> and for resolving disputes and alleged breaches.
>
> Treaties are roughly analogous to contracts 
> in that they establish the rights and binding obligations of the parties. 
> 
> They vary in their 
> - obligations (the extent to which states are bound to the rules), 
> - precision (the extent to which the rules are unambiguous), and 
> - delegation (the extent to which third parties have authority to interpret, apply and make rules). 
> 
> Treaties can take many forms and govern a wide range of subject matters, 
> such as security, trade, environment, and human rights; 
> they may also be used to establish international institutions, 
> such as the International Criminal Court and the United Nations, 
> for which they often provide a governing framework. 
> 
> Treaties serve as primary sources of international law 
> and have codified or established most international legal principles 
> since the early 20th century. 
> 
> In contrast with other sources of international law, such as customary international law, 
> treaties are only binding on the parties that have signed and ratified them.
>
> Notwithstanding the VCLT and customary international law, 
> treaties are not required to follow any standard form, 
> and differ widely in substance and complexity. 
> Nevertheless, all valid treaties must comply with the legal principle of pacta sunt servanda 
> (Latin: "agreements must be kept"), 
> under which parties are committed to perform their duties 
> and honor their agreements in good faith. 
> 
> A treaty may also be invalidated, and thus rendered unenforceable, 
> if it violates a preemptory norm (jus cogens), 
> such as permitting a war of aggression or crimes against humanity.
