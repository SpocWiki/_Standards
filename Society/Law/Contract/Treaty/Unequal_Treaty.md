## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The unequal treaties were a series of agreements made between Asian countries—
> most notably Qing China, Tokugawa Japan and Joseon Korea—and Western countries—
> most notably the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy, the United States and Russia—
> during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
> 
> They were often signed following a military defeat suffered by the Asian party, 
> or amid military threats made by the Western party. 
> 
> The terms specified obligations to be borne almost exclusively by the Asian party 
> and included provisions such as the cession of territory, payment of reparations, 
> opening of treaty ports, relinquishment of the right to control tariffs and imports, 
> and granting of extraterritoriality to foreign citizens.
>
> With the rise of Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism in the 1920s, 
> both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party used the concept 
> to characterize the Chinese experience of 
> losing sovereignty between roughly 1840 to 1950. 
> 
> The term "unequal treaty" became associated with the concept of 
> China's "century of humiliation", especially the concessions to foreign powers 
> and the loss of tariff autonomy through treaty ports, 
> and continues to serve as a major impetus for the foreign policy of China today.
>
> Japan and Korea also use the term to refer to several treaties 
> that resulted in a reduction of their national sovereignty. 
> 
> Japan and China signed treaties with Korea such as the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 
> and China–Korea Treaty of 1882, 
> with each granting privileges to the former parties concerning Korea. 
> 
> Japan after the Meiji Restoration also began enforcing unequal treaties against China 
> after its victory in the First Sino-Japanese War 
> for influence over Korea as well as China's coastal ports and territories.
