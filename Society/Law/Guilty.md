> In criminal law, guilt is the state of being responsible for the commission of an offense. 
> Legal guilt is entirely externally defined by the state, or more generally a "court of law". 
> Being factually guilty of a criminal offense means that one has committed a violation of criminal law 
> or performed all the elements of the offense set out by a criminal statute. 
> 
> The determination that one has committed that violation is made by an external body (a "court of law") 
> after the determination of the facts by a finder of fact or "factfinder" (i.e., a jury) 
> and is, therefore, as definitive as the record-keeping of the body. 
> 
> For instance, in the case of a bench trial, a judge acts as both the court of law and the factfinder, 
> whereas in a jury trial, the jury is the trier of fact and the judge acts only as the trier of law.
