> Common law (also known as judicial precedent, judge-made law, or case law) 
> is the body of law primarily developed through judicial decisions rather than statutes. 
> Although common law may incorporate certain statutes, 
> it is largely based on precedent—judicial rulings made in previous similar cases. 
> The presiding judge determines which precedents to apply in deciding each new case.
>
> England spread the English legal system across the British Isles, first to Wales, 
> and then to Ireland and overseas colonies; this was continued by the later British Empire. 
> 
> Many former colonies retain the common law system today. 
> These common law systems are legal systems that give great weight to judicial precedent, 
> and to the style of reasoning inherited from the English legal system. 
> 
> Today, approximately one-third of the world's population lives in common law jurisdictions 
> or in mixed legal systems that integrate common law and civil law.
>
> Common law is deeply rooted in stare decisis ("to stand by things decided"), 
> where courts follow precedents established by previous decisions. 
> 
> When a similar case has been resolved, 
> courts typically align their reasoning with the precedent set in that decision. 
> However, in a "case of first impression" with no precedent or clear legislative guidance, 
> judges are empowered to resolve the issue and establish new precedent.
>
> The common law, so named because it was common to all the king's courts across England, 
> originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings 
> in the centuries following the Norman Conquest in 1066. 
> 
> It established a unified legal system, gradually supplanting the local folk courts and manorial courts
