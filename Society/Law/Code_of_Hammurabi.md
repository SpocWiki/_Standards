## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Code of Hammurabi is a Babylonian legal text composed during 1755–1750 BC. 
> It is the longest, best-organized, and best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. 
> It is written in the Old Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, 
> purportedly by Hammurabi, sixth king of the First Dynasty of Babylon. 
> The primary copy of the text is inscribed on a basalt stele 2.25 m (7 ft 4+1⁄2 in) tall.
>
> The stele was rediscovered in 1901 at the site of Susa in present-day Iran, 
> where it had been taken as plunder six hundred years after its creation. 
> The text itself was copied and studied by Mesopotamian scribes for over a millennium. 
> The stele now resides in the Louvre Museum.
>
> The top of the stele features an image in relief of Hammurabi 
> with Shamash, the Babylonian sun god and god of justice. 
> 
> Below the relief are about 4,130 lines of cuneiform text: 
> one fifth contains a prologue and epilogue in poetic style, 
> while the remaining four fifths contain what are generally called the laws. 
> 
> In the prologue, Hammurabi claims to have been granted his rule by the gods 
> "to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak". 
> The laws are casuistic, expressed as "if ... then" conditional sentences. 
> Their scope is broad, including, for example, criminal law, family law, property law, 
> and commercial law.
>
> Modern scholars responded to the Code with admiration at its perceived fairness 
> and respect for the rule of law, and at the complexity of Old Babylonian society. 
> There was also much discussion of its influence on the Mosaic Law. 
> Scholars quickly identified lex talionis—the "eye for an eye" principle—
> underlying the two collections. 
> 
> Debate among Assyriologists has since centred around several aspects of the Code: 
> its purpose, its underlying principles, its language, and its relation to earlier and later law collections.
>
> Despite the uncertainty surrounding these issues, 
> Hammurabi is regarded outside Assyriology as an important figure in the history of law 
> and the document as a true legal code. 
> The U.S. Capitol has a relief portrait of Hammurabi alongside those of other historic lawgivers. 
> There are replicas of the stele in numerous institutions, 
> including the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City 
> and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.
