> A **Duty** (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; Old French: deu, did, past participle of devoir; 
> Latin: debere, debitum, whence "debt") is a commitment 
> or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise. 
> 
> A duty may arise from a system of ethics or morality, especially in an honor culture. 
> Many duties are created by law, 
> sometimes including a codified punishment or liability for non-performance. 
> Performing one's duty may require some sacrifice of self-interest.
>
> A sense-of-duty is also a virtue or personality trait 
> that characterizes someone who is diligent about fulfilling individual duties 
> or who confidently knows their calling. 
> 
> A sense-of-duty can also come from a need to fulfill familial pressures and desires. 
> This is typically seen in a militaristic or patriotic way. 
> A distinction is commonly made between "positive duties", which a person must undertake, 
> and "negative duties", which relate to actions from which a person must refrain. 
> Michael Freeman notes that negative duties may be easier to fulfill as they do not require any action.
>
> Cicero, an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work "On Duties", 
> suggests that duties can come from four different sources:
> - as a result of being a human
> - as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)
> - as a result of one's character
> - as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself.
>
> The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, 
> depending on jurisdiction, religion, and social normalities.
