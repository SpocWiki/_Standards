## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> At common law, **Damages** are a remedy in the form of a monetary award 
> to be paid to a claimant as compensation for loss or injury. 
> 
> To warrant the award, the claimant must show that a breach of duty has caused foreseeable loss. 
> To be recognized at law, the loss must involve damage to property, or mental or physical injury; 
> pure economic loss is rarely recognized for the award of damages.
>
> Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages, 
> which are economic losses such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses, 
> and general damages, which are non-economic damages 
> such as pain and suffering and emotional distress. 
> 
> Rather than being compensatory, at common law 
> damages may instead be nominal, contemptuous or exemplary.
