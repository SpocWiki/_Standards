## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In the field of jurisprudence, equity is the particular body of law, 
> developed in the English Court of Chancery, 
> with the general purpose of providing legal remedies 
> for cases wherein the common law is inflexible and cannot fairly resolve the disputed legal matter. 
> 
> Conceptually, equity was part of the historical origins of the system of common law of England, 
> yet is a field of law separate from common law, 
> because equity has its own unique rules and principles, and was administered by courts of equity. 
>
> Equity exists in domestic law, both in civil law and in common law systems, as well as in international law. 
> The tradition of equity begins in antiquity with the writings of Aristotle (epieikeia) 
> and with Roman law (aequitas). 
> 
> Later, **in civil law systems, equity was integrated in the legal rules**, 
> while in common law systems it became an independent body of law.
