> Labour laws (also spelled as labor laws), labour code or employment laws 
> are those that mediate the relationship between workers, employing entities, trade unions, and the government. 
> 
> Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship 
> between employee, employer, and union.
>
> Individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work also through the contract for work. 
> 
> Employment standards are social norms (in some cases also technical standards) 
> for the minimum socially acceptable conditions 
> under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. 
> 
> Government agencies (such as the former US Employment Standards Administration) 
> enforce labour law (legislature, regulatory, or judicial).
