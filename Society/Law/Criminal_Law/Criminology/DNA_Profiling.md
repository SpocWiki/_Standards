> DNA profiling (also called DNA fingerprinting and genetic fingerprinting) 
> is the process of determining an individual's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) characteristics. 
> DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called DNA barcoding.
>
> DNA profiling is a forensic technique in criminal investigations, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime. It is also used in paternity testing, to establish immigration eligibility, and in genealogical and medical research. DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.
