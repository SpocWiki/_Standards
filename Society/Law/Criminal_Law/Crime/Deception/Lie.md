## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Lie** is an assertion that is believed to be false, 
> typically used with the purpose of deceiving  or misleading someone. 
> 
> The practice of communicating lies is called lying. 
> A person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar. 
> 
> Lies can be interpreted as deliberately false statements or misleading statements, 
> though not all statements that are literally false are considered lies – 
> metaphors, hyperboles, and other figurative rhetoric are not intended to mislead, 
> while lies are explicitly meant for literal interpretation by their audience. 
> Lies may also serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them.
>
> Generally, the term "lie" carries a negative connotation, 
> and depending on the context a person who communicates 
> a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions; 
> for instance, perjury, or the act of lying under oath, 
> can result in criminal and civil charges being pressed against the perjurer.
>
> Although people in many cultures 
> believe that deception can be detected by observing nonverbal behaviors 
> (e.g. not making eye contact, fidgeting, stuttering, smiling) 
> research indicates that people overestimate both the significance of such cues 
> and their ability to make accurate judgements about deception. 
> 
> More generally, people's ability to make true judgments 
> is affected by biases towards accepting incoming information 
> and interpreting feelings as evidence of truth. 
> 
> People do not always check incoming assertions against their memory.
