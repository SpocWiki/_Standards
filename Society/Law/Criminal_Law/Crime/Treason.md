## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Treason** is the crime of attacking an authority to which one owes allegiance. 
> 
> Treason is framed as infamous, because it threatens the current Structure. 
> 
> This typically includes acts such as participating in a war against one's native country, 
> attempting to overthrow its government, spying on its military, its diplomats, its officials, 
> or its secret services for a hostile foreign power, or attempting to kill its head of state. 
> 
> A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor.
>
> Historically, in common law countries, 
> treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, 
> such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant. 
> 
> Treason (i.e., disloyalty) against one's monarch was known as high treason 
> and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason. 
> As jurisdictions around the world abolished petty treason, 
> "treason" came to refer to what was historically known as high treason.
>
> At times, the term traitor has been used as a political epithet, 
> regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. 
> 
> In a civil war or insurrection, the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. 
> Likewise the term traitor is used in heated political discussion – 
> typically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power 
> who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. 
> 
> In certain cases, as with the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), 
> the accusation of treason towards a large group of people 
> can be a unifying political message.
