> **Extortion** is the practice of obtaining benefit (e.g., money or goods) through coercion. 
> In most jurisdictions it is likely to constitute a criminal offence. 
> 
> Robbery is the simplest and most common form of extortion, 
> although making unfounded threats in order to obtain an unfair business advantage is also a form of extortion.
>
> Extortion is sometimes called the "protection racket" because the racketeers often phrase their demands 
> as payment for "protection" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties; 
> though often, and almost always, such "protection" is simply abstinence of harm from the same party, 
> and such is implied in the "protection" offer. 
> 
> Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime. 
> 
> In some jurisdictions, actually obtaining the benefit is not required to commit the offense, 
> and making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property 
> to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. 
> 
> Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, 
> but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering 
> or making somebody endure something unpleasant.
>
> The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging, 
> though neither is legally considered extortion. 
> It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations 
> where one person feels indebted against their will, to another, 
> in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences. 
> 
> Neither extortion nor blackmail requires a threat of a criminal act, such as violence, 
> merely a threat used to elicit actions, money, or property from the object of the extortion. 
> 
> Such threats include the filing of reports (true or not) of criminal behavior to the police, 
> revelation of damaging facts (such as pictures of the object of the extortion in a compromising position), etc. 
>
> In law, extortion can refer to political corruption, such as selling one's office or influence peddling, 
> but in general vocabulary the word usually first brings to mind blackmail or protection rackets. 
> 
> The logical connection between the corruption sense of the word and the other senses is 
> that to demand bribes in one's official capacity is blackmail or racketeering in essence 
> (that is, "you need access to this resource, the government restricts access to it through my office, 
> and I will charge you unfairly and unlawfully for such access"). 
> Extortion is also known as shakedown, and occasionally exaction.
