> Mara Salvatrucha, commonly known as **MS-13**, is an international criminal gang 
> that originated in Los Angeles, California, in the 1980s. 
> 
> Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants 
> from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. 
> Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. 
> MS-13 has a longtime rivalry with the 18th Street gang.
>
> Many MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador 
> after the end of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992, or upon being arrested, 
> facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. 
> 
> The gang is active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are Central American—Salvadorans in particular.
>
> As an international gang, its history is closely tied to United States–El Salvador relations. 
> In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 
> accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million members of any gang in the United States, 
> but a similar share of gang murders. 
> 
> On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order 
> initiating the process to designate various drug cartels and transnational gangs, 
> including MS-13, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). 
> 
> The order was officially enacted on February 20, 2025, 
> making such groups officially terrorist organizations.
