> A **Ponzi Scheme** (Italian: [ˈpontsi]) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. 
> Named after Italian con artist Charles Ponzi, this type of scheme misleads investors by 
> - either falsely suggesting that profits are derived from legitimate business activities (whereas the business activities are non-existent), 
> - or by exaggerating the extent and profitability of the legitimate business activities, using new investments to fabricate or supplement these profits. 
> 
> A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as investors continue to contribute new funds, 
> and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment or lose faith in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.
>
> Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of the Ponzi scheme were carried out 
> - from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and 
> - by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the "Ladies' Deposit". 
> - 
> Howe offered a solely female clientele an 8% monthly interest rate and then stole the money that the women had invested. 
> She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison. 
> 
> The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels by Charles Dickens:
> - his 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and 
> - his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.
>
> In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well known throughout the United States 
> because of the huge amount of money that he took in. 
> 
> His original scheme was purportedly based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, 
> but it proved infeasible, and he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself. 
> 
> Unlike earlier similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally 
> both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.
