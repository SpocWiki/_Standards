> Bernard Lawrence  Madoff (; April 29, 1938 – April 14, 2021) was an American financial criminal and financier 
> who was the admitted mastermind of the largest known Ponzi scheme in history, worth an estimated $65 billion. 
> 
> He was at one time chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange. 
> Madoff's firm had two basic units: a stock brokerage and an asset management business; 
> the Ponzi scheme was centered in the asset management business.
>
> Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960, which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. 
> He served as the company's chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008. 
> That year, the firm was the sixth-largest market maker in S&P 500 stocks.  
> While the stock brokerage part of the business had a public profile, 
> Madoff tried to keep his asset management business low profile and exclusive.
>
> At the firm, he employed his brother Peter Madoff as senior managing director and chief compliance officer, 
> Peter's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm's rules and compliance officer and attorney, 
> and his sons Mark Madoff and Andrew Madoff. 
> 
> Mark hanged himself in 2010, exactly two years after his father's arrest, 
> Peter was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2012, and Andrew died of lymphoma on September 3, 2014.
>
> On December 10, 2008, Madoff's sons Mark and Andrew told authorities 
> that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme, 
> and quoted him as saying that it was "one big lie". 
> 
> The following day, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Madoff 
> and charged him with one count of securities fraud. 
> 
> The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously conducted multiple investigations into his business practices 
> but had not uncovered the massive fraud. 
> 
> On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies 
> and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme.
>
> The Madoff investment scandal defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars. 
> Madoff said that he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s, 
> but an ex-trader admitted in court to faking records for Madoff since the early 1970s. 
> 
> Those charged with recovering the missing money believe that the investment operation may never have been legitimate. 
> The amount missing from client accounts was almost $65 billion, including fabricated gains. 
>
> The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual direct losses to investors of $18 billion, 
> of which $14.829 billion has been recovered and returned, while the search for additional funds continues. 
> 
> On June 29, 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed. 
> On April 14, 2021, he died at the Federal Medical Center, Butner, in North Carolina, from chronic kidney disease.
