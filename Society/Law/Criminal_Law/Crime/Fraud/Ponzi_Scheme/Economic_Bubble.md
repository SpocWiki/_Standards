## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Economic bubble** (also called a speculative bubble or a financial bubble) is a period when current asset prices 
> greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify. 
> 
> Bubbles can be caused by overly optimistic projections about the scale and sustainability of growth (e.g. dot-com bubble), 
> and/or by the belief that intrinsic valuation is no longer relevant when making an investment (e.g. Tulip mania). 
> 
> They have appeared in most asset classes, including equities (e.g. Roaring Twenties), commodities (e.g. Uranium bubble), 
> real estate (e.g. 2000s US housing bubble), and even esoteric assets (e.g. Cryptocurrency bubble). 
> 
> Bubbles usually form as a result of either excess liquidity in markets, and/or changed investor psychology. 
> Large multi-asset bubbles (e.g. 1980s Japanese asset bubble and the 2020–21 Everything bubble), 
> are attributed to central banking liquidity (e.g. overuse of the Fed put).
>
> In the early stages of a bubble, many investors do not recognise the bubble for what it is. 
> People notice the prices are going up and often think it is justified. 
> Therefore bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, after the bubble has already "popped" and prices have crashed.
