[[Economic_Ideology/Mercantilism|Mercantilism]] was the predominant Ideology before [[Economic_Ideology/Capitalism|Capitalism]]. 

The displacement of Keynesian thinking was driven by those who leaned towards purer [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") policies, rather than the [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") which require a significant role for government intervention. Their motivations included a dislike of large governments which they saw as prone to interfere excessively in the lives of their citizens; an intellectual preference for [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics "Classical economics") or [Neoclassical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics") and related schools; or in some cases a belief that their individual interests were best served by promoting a limited role for government.
