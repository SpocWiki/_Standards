## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Mercantilism** is a nationalist economic policy that is designed to 
> - maximize the exports and 
> - minimize the imports of an economy. 
> In other words, it seeks to maximize the __accumulation of resources__ within the country 
> and use those resources for one-sided trade. 
>
> The concept aims to reduce a possible current account deficit or reach a current account surplus, 
> and it includes measures aimed at __accumulating monetary reserves__ by a positive balance of trade, 
> especially of finished goods. 
> Historically, such policies may have contributed to war and motivated colonial expansion. 
> Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time.
>
> Mercantilism promotes government regulation of a nation's economy 
> for the purpose of augmenting and bolstering state power at the expense of rival national powers. 
> 
> High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods, were almost universally a feature of mercantilist policy. 
> Before it fell into decline, mercantilism was dominant in modernized parts of Europe 
> and some areas in Africa from the 16th to the 19th centuries, a period of proto-industrialization. 
> Some commentators argue that it is still practised in the economies of industrializing countries 
> in the form of economic interventionism.
>
> With the efforts of supranational organizations such as the World Trade Organization 
> to reduce tariffs globally, non-tariff barriers to trade 
> have assumed a greater importance in neomercantilism.
