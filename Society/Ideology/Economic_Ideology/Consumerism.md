## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Consumerism** is a socio-cultural and economic phenomenon 
> that is typical of industrialized societies. 
> 
> It is characterized by the continuous acquisition of goods and services 
> in ever-increasing quantities. 
> 
> In contemporary consumer society, the purchase and the consumption of products 
> have evolved beyond the mere satisfaction of basic human needs, 
> transforming into an activity that is not only economic 
> but also cultural, social, and even identity-forming. 
> 
> It emerged in Western Europe and the United States during the Industrial Revolution 
> and became widespread around the 20th century. 
> 
> In economics, consumerism refers to policies that emphasize consumption. 
> It is the consideration that the free choice of consumers 
> should strongly inform the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how, 
> and therefore influence the economic organization of a society.
>
> Consumerism has been criticized by both 
> - individuals who choose other ways of participating in the economy 
>   (i.e. choosing simple living or slow living) and 
> - environmentalists concerned about its impact on the planet. 
> 
> Experts often assert that consumerism has physical limits, 
> such as growth imperative and overconsumption, 
> which have larger impacts on the environment. 
> 
> This includes direct effects like overexploitation of natural resources 
> or large amounts of waste from disposable goods 
> and significant effects like climate change. 
> 
> Similarly, some research and criticism focuses on the 
> sociological effects of consumerism, such as 
> - reinforcement of class barriers and 
> - creation of inequalities.
