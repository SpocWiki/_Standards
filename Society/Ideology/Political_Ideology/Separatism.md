> **Separatism** is the advocacy of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, regional, governmental, 
> or gender separation from the larger group. 
> 
> As with secession, separatism conventionally refers to full political separation. 
> 
> Groups simply seeking greater autonomy are usually not considered separatists. 
> 
> Some discourse settings equate separatism with 
> religious segregation, racial segregation, or sex segregation, 
> while other discourse settings take the broader view that 
> separation by choice may serve useful purposes 
> and is not the same as government-enforced segregation. 
> 
> There is some academic debate about this definition, 
> and in particular how it relates to secessionism, as has been discussed online.
>
> Separatist groups practice a form of identity politics, or political activity 
> and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of the group's members. 
> 
> Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups 
> compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination. 
> 
> However, economic and political factors usually are 
> critical in creating strong separatist movements 
> as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.
