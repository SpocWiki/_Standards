## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Leninism** (Russian: Ленинизм, Leninizm) is a political ideology 
> developed by Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin 
> that proposes the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
> led by a revolutionary vanguard party as the political prelude to the establishment of communism.
>
> Lenin's ideological contributions to the Marxist ideology 
> relate to his theories on the party, imperialism, the state, and revolution. 
> The function of the Leninist vanguard party is to provide the working classes 
> with the political consciousness (education and organisation) 
> and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in the Russian Empire (1721–1917).
>
> Leninist revolutionary leadership is based upon The Communist Manifesto (1848), 
> identifying the communist party as "the most advanced and resolute section 
> of the working class parties of every country; that section which pushes forward all others." 
> As the vanguard party, the Bolsheviks viewed history through 
> the theoretical framework of dialectical materialism, 
> which sanctioned political commitment to the successful overthrow of capitalism, 
> and then to instituting socialism; and, as the revolutionary national government, 
> to realise the socio-economic transition by all means.
>
> In the aftermath of the October Revolution (1917), 
> Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia and the basis of soviet democracy, 
> the rule of directly elected soviets. 
> 
> In establishing the socialist mode of production in Bolshevik Russia—
> with the Decree on Land (1917), war communism (1918–1921), 
> and the New Economic Policy (1921–1928)—
> the revolutionary régime suppressed most political opposition, including Marxists who opposed Lenin's actions, the anarchists and the Mensheviks, factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
> 
> The Russian Civil War (1917–1922), which included the seventeen-army Allied intervention, and left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks (1918–1924), 
> was an external and internal war which transformed Bolshevik Russia 
> into the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR), 
> the core republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
>
> As revolutionary praxis, Leninism originally was neither a proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. Leninism comprises politico-economic developments of orthodox Marxism and Lenin's interpretations of Marxism, which function as a pragmatic synthesis for practical application to the actual conditions (political, social, economic) of the post-emancipation agrarian society of Imperial Russia in the early 20th century. As a political-science term, Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution entered common usage at the fifth congress of the Communist International (1924), when Grigory Zinoviev applied the term Leninism to denote "vanguard-party revolution." Leninism was accepted as part of CPSU's vocabulary and doctrine around 1922, and in January 1923, despite objections from Lenin, it entered the public vocabulary.
