> Collective farming and communal farming are various types of agricultural production 
> in which multiple farmers run their holdings as a joint enterprise. 
> 
> There are two broad types of communal farms: agricultural cooperatives, 
> in which member-owners jointly engage in farming activities as a collective; 
> and state farms, which are owned and directly run by a centralized government. 
> 
> The process by which farmland is aggregated is called **Collectivization**. 
> In some countries (including the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc countries, China and Vietnam) 
> there have been both state-run and cooperative-run variants. 
> For example, the Soviet Union had both 
> - kolkhozy (cooperative-run farms) and
