> Green politics, or ecopolitics, is a political ideology 
> that aims to foster an ecologically sustainable society often, but not always, 
> rooted in environmentalism, nonviolence, social justice and grassroots democracy. 
> 
> It began taking shape in the Western world in the 1970s; 
> since then, green parties have developed 
> and established themselves in many countries around the globe 
> and have achieved some electoral success.
>
> The political term green was used initially in relation to die GrÃ¼nen (German for "the Greens"), 
> a green party formed in the late 1970s. 
> 
> The term political ecology is sometimes used in academic circles, 
> but it has come to represent an interdisciplinary field of study 
> as the academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with political economy in topics such as degradation and marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation and control and environmental identities and social movements.
>
> Supporters of green politics share many ideas with the conservation, environmental, feminist and peace movements. In addition to democracy and ecological issues, green politics is concerned with civil liberties, social justice, nonviolence, sometimes variants of localism and tends to support social progressivism. Green party platforms are largely considered left in the political spectrum. The green ideology has connections with various other ecocentric political ideologies, including ecofeminism, eco-socialism, degrowth and green anarchism, but to what extent these can be seen as forms of green politics is a matter of debate. As the left-wing green political philosophy developed, there also came into separate existence opposite movements on the right-wing that include ecological components such as eco-capitalism and green conservatism.
