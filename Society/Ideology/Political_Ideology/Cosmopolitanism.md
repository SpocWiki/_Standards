## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Cosmopolitanism** is the idea that all human beings are members of a single community. 
> Its adherents are known as cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. 
> 
> Cosmopolitanism is both prescriptive and aspirational, 
> believing humans can and should be "world citizens" in a "universal community". 
> The idea encompasses different dimensions and avenues of community, such as promoting universal moral standards, establishing global political structures, or developing a platform for mutual cultural expression and tolerance.
>
> For example, Kwame Anthony Appiah articulates a cosmopolitan community where individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.). In a looser but related sense, "cosmopolitan" is also used to describe places where people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious backgrounds live together and interact with each other.
