> The **Unite the Right rally** was a white supremacist rally 
> that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, from August 11 to 12, 2017. 
> 
> Marchers included members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, 
> neo-fascists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and far-right militias. 
> 
> Some groups chanted racist and antisemitic slogans and carried weapons, 
> Nazi and neo-Nazi symbols, the Valknut, Confederate battle flags, Deus vult crosses, flags, 
> and other symbols of various past and present antisemitic and anti-Islamic groups. 
> 
> The organizers' stated goals included 
> - the unification of the American white nationalist movement and 
> - opposing the proposed removal of the statue of General Robert E. Lee 
>   from Charlottesville's former Lee Park. 
> 
> The rally sparked a national debate over Confederate iconography, racial violence, 
> and white supremacy. The event had hundreds of participants. 
>
> The rally occurred amid the controversy which was 
> generated by the removal of Confederate monuments by local governments 
> following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, 
> in which Dylann Roof, a white supremacist, shot and killed nine members of a black church, 
> including the minister (a state senator), and wounded another member of the church. 
> 
> The rally turned violent after protesters clashed with counter-protesters, 
> resulting in more than 30 injured. 
> 
> On the morning of August 12, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, 
> stating that public safety could not be safeguarded without additional powers. 
> Within an hour, at 11:22 a.m., 
> the Virginia State Police declared the rally to be an unlawful assembly. 
> 
> At around 1:45 p.m., self-identified white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. 
> deliberately rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters 
> about 1⁄2 mile (800 m) away from the rally site, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 35 people. 
> 
> Fields fled the scene in his car but was arrested soon afterward. 
> He was tried and convicted in Virginia state court of first-degree murder, malicious wounding, 
> and other crimes in 2018, with the jury recommending 
> a sentence of life imprisonment plus 419 years. 
> The following year, Fields pleaded guilty to 29 federal hate crimes in a plea agreement 
> to avoid the death penalty in this trial.
>
> US President Donald Trump's remarks about the rally generated negative responses. 
> In his initial statement following the rally, 
> Trump condemned the "display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides." 
> This first statement and his subsequent defenses of it, 
> in which he also referred to "very fine people on both sides", 
> were criticized as implying a moral equivalence 
> between the white supremacist protesters and the counter-protesters. 
> Trump later stated (in the same statement) 
> that "I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, 
> because they should be condemned totally–
> but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists".
>
> The rally and resulting death and injuries 
> resulted in a backlash against white supremacist groups in the United States. 
> 
> A number of groups that participated in the rally had events canceled by universities, 
> and their financial and social media accounts closed by major companies. 
> 
> Some Twitter users led a campaign to identify 
> and publicly shame marchers at the rally from photographs; 
> at least one rally attendee was dismissed from his job as a result of the campaign. 
> 
> While the organizers intended for the rally to unite far-right groups 
> with the goal of playing a larger role in American politics, 
> the backlash and resultant infighting between alt-right leaders 
> has been credited with causing a decline in the movement.
>
> After Charlottesville refused to approve another march, 
> Unite the Right held an anniversary rally on August 11–12, 2018, 
> called "Unite the Right 2", in Washington, D.C. 
> 
> The rally drew only 20–30 protesters amidst thousands of counter-protesters, 
> including religious organizations, civil rights groups, and anti-fascist organizers.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Unite the Right** (French: Unir la Droite) movement 
> was a Canadian political movement which existed from around the mid-1990s to 2003. 
> The movement came into being when it became clear that 
> neither of Canada's two main right-of-centre political parties, 
> - the Reform Party of Canada/Canadian Alliance (CA) and 
> - the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC), 
> was independently capable of defeating the governing Liberal Party. 
> 
> The objective of the movement, therefore, was to merge the two parties into a single party 
> (or, if this was not possible, to find a power-sharing arrangement between the two parties). 
> The goal of uniting the right was accomplished in December 2003 
> with the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada.
