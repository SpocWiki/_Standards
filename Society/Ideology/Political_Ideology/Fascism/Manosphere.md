> The **Manosphere** is a diverse collection of websites, blogs, 
> and online forums promoting masculinity, misogyny, and opposition to feminism. 
> 
> Communities within the manosphere include men's rights activists (MRAs), 
> incels (involuntary celibates), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), 
> pick-up artists (PUA), Right-wing Supremacists and fathers' rights groups. 
> 
> While the specifics of each group's beliefs sometimes conflict, 
> they are generally united in the belief that society is biased against men 
> due to the influence of feminism, and that feminists promote misandry, or hatred of men. 
> Acceptance of these ideas is described as "taking the red pill", 
> a metaphor borrowed from the film The Matrix.
>
> The manosphere overlaps with the far-right and alt-right communities. 
> It has also been associated with online harassment 
> and has been implicated in radicalizing men into misogynist beliefs 
> and the glorification of violence against women. 
> 
> Some sources have associated manosphere-based radicalization 
> with mass shootings motivated by misogyny. 
> 
> The manosphere received significant media coverage 
> - following the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California, 
> - the 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, 
> - and the 2018 Toronto van attack, 
> - as well as the online harassment campaign against women in the video game industry 
> known as [[GamerGate]].
