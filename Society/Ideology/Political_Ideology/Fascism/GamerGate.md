> **GamerGate** (GG) was a loosely organized misogynistic online harassment campaign 
> and a right-wing backlash against feminism, diversity, 
> and progressivism in video game culture. 
> 
> It was conducted using the hashtag "#Gamergate" primarily in 2014 and 2015. 
> Gamergate targeted women in the video game industry, 
> most notably feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian 
> and video game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu. 
>
> Gamergate began with an August 2014 blog entry called "The Zoe Post" 
> by Quinn's ex-boyfriend, which falsely insinuated that Quinn had received a favorable review, 
> because of Quinn's sexual relationship with a games journalist. 
> 
> The blog post was spread to 4chan, 
> where many users had previously disparaged Quinn's work. 
> This led to a campaign of harassment against Quinn, 
> coordinated through anonymous message boards such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit. 
> The harassment campaign expanded to target Sarkeesian, Wu, 
> and others who defended Quinn, and included [[doxing]], rape threats, and death threats.
>
> Gamergate proponents claimed to be promoting ethics in video game journalism 
> and protecting the "gamer" identity in opposition to "political correctness" 
> and the perceived influence of feminism 
> and so-called "social justice warriors" on video game culture. 
> 
> Proponents alleged there was a conspiracy between journalists and video game developers 
> to focus on progressive social issues such as gender equality and sexism. 
> 
> Such claims have been widely dismissed as trivial, baseless, 
> or unrelated to actual issues of ethics in gaming and journalism. 
> 
> Several commentators in the mass media dismissed the ethics complaints as a 
> deliberate cover for the ongoing harassment of Quinn and other women. 
> Gamergaters frequently denied any such harassment took place, 
> falsely claiming it to be manufactured by the victims.
>
> Gamergate has been described as a culture war over cultural diversification, 
> artistic recognition, feminism in video games, social criticism in video games, 
> and the social identity of gamers. 
> 
> Supporters stated that it was a social movement. 
> However, as a movement Gamergate had no clearly defined goals, coherent message, 
> or official leaders, making it difficult to define. 
> 
> Gamergate led figures both inside and outside the gaming industry 
> to focus on methods of addressing online harassment, 
> ways to minimize harm, and prevent similar events. 
> 
> Gamergate has been viewed as contributing to the [[alt-right_Movement]] and other right-wing movements.
