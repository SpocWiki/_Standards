> The **alt-right** (abbreviated from alternative right) is a far-right, white nationalist movement. 
> A largely online phenomenon, the alt-right originated in the United States 
> during the late 2000s before increasing in popularity 
> and establishing a presence in other countries during the mid-2010s, 
> and has been declining since 2017. 
> 
> The term is ill-defined and has been used in different ways by academics, 
> journalists, media commentators, and alt-right members themselves.
>
> In 2010, the American white nationalist 
> Richard B. Spencer launched The Alternative Right webzine. 
> His "alternative right" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, 
> as well as paleoconservatism, the Dark Enlightenment, and the Nouvelle Droite. 
> 
> His term was shortened to "alt-right" and 
> popularized by far-right participants of /pol/, the politics board of the web forum 4chan. 
> 
> It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, 
> including Andrew Anglin's [[Daily Stormer]], Brad Griffin's Occidental Dissent, 
> and Matthew Heimbach's Traditionalist Worker Party. 
> 
> Following the 2014 [[GamerGate]] controversy, 
> the alt-right made increasing use of trolling and online harassment to raise its profile. 
> 
> It attracted broader attention in 2015, 
> particularly through coverage on Steve Bannon's Breitbart News, 
> due to alt-right support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. 
> Upon being elected, Trump disavowed the movement. 
> 
> Attempting to transform itself from an online-based movement to a physical one, 
> Spencer and other alt-right figures organized the 
> August 2017 [[Unite_the_Right_rally]] in [[Charlottesville,Virginia]], 
> which led to violent clashes with counter-demonstrators and resulted in one death 
> when an alt-right member drove his car through the crowd of counter-demonstrators. 
> This was also shown at the end of the Movie [[BlacKkKlansman]]. 
> The fallout from the rally resulted in a decline of the alt-right.
>
> The alt-right movement espouses the pseudoscientific idea of biological racism 
> and promotes a form of identity politics in favor of European Americans 
> and white people internationally. 
> 
> Anti-egalitarian in nature, it rejects the liberal democratic basis of U.S. governance, 
> and opposes both the conservative and liberal wings of the country's political mainstream. 
> 
> Many of its members seek to replace the U.S. with a white separatist ethnostate. 
> Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable, 
> while others (known as the "1488" scene) 
> adopt openly white supremacist and neo-Nazi stances to shock and provoke. 
> 
> Some alt-rightists are antisemitic, promoting a conspiracy theory 
> that there is a Jewish plot to bring about white genocide, 
> although other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. 
> 
> The alt-right is anti-feminist and intersects with the online manosphere. 
> Most adherents to the alt-right are also Islamophobic. 
> The movement distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism 
> through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, 
> particularly through the promotion of memes like [[Pepe the Frog]]. 
> Individuals who are aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas 
> without espousing its white nationalism have been termed "alt-lite".
>
> The alt-right's membership is overwhelmingly white and male, 
> attracted to the movement by deteriorating living standards and prospects, 
> anxieties about the social role of white masculinity, 
> and anger at left-wing and non-white forms of identity politics 
> such as feminism and Black Lives Matter. 
> 
> Alt-right material has contributed to the radicalization of men 
> responsible for various murders and terrorist attacks in the U.S. since 2014. 
> Critics charge that the term "alt-right" is merely a rebranding of white supremacism.
