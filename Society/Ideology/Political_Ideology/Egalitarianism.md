> **Egalitarianism** (from French  Ã©gal 'equal'; also equalitarianism) 
> is a school of thought within political philosophy that builds on the concept of social equality, 
> prioritizing it for all people. 
> 
> Egalitarian doctrines are generally characterized by the idea 
> that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. 
> As such, all people should be accorded equal rights and treatment under the law. 
> Egalitarian doctrines have supported many modern social movements, 
> including the Enlightenment, feminism, civil rights, and international human rights. 
> Egalitarianism is the foundation of left-wing politics.
>
> One key aspect of egalitarianism is its emphasis on **equal opportunities** for all individuals, 
> regardless of their background or circumstances. 
> 
> This means ensuring that everyone has access to the same resources, education, 
> and opportunities to succeed in life. 
> By promoting equal opportunities, egalitarianism aims to level the playing field 
> and reduce disparities that result from social inequalities.
