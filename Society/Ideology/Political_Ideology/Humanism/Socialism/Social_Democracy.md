> Social democracy is a social, economic, and political philosophy within socialism 
> that supports political and economic democracy 
> and a gradualist, reformist, and democratic approach 
> toward achieving social equality within capitalism. 
> 
> In modern practice, social democracy has taken the form of democratic socialism, 
> a robust welfare state, policies promoting social justice, market regulation, 
> and a more equitable distribution of income.
>
> Social democracy maintains a commitment to representative and participatory democracy. 
> 
> Common aims include curbing inequality, eliminating the oppression of underprivileged groups, eradicating poverty, and upholding universally accessible public services such as child care, education, elderly care, health care, and workers' compensation. 
> 
> Economically, it supports income redistribution 
> and regulating the economy in the public interest.
>
> Social democracy has a strong, long-standing connection with trade unions 
> and the broader labour movement. 
> 
> It is supportive of measures 
> to foster greater democratic decision-making in the economic sphere, 
> including collective bargaining and co-determination rights for workers.
>
> The history of social democracy stretches back to the 19th-century labour movement. 
> 
> Originally a catch-all term for socialists of varying tendencies, 
> after the Russian Revolution, it came to refer to reformist socialists 
> who were strategically opposed to revolution 
> as well as the authoritarianism of the Soviet model, 
> nonetheless the eventual abolition of capitalism was still being upheld 
> as an important end goal during this time. 
> 
> However, by the 1990s social democrats had embraced mixed economies 
> with a predominance of private property and promoted the regulation of capitalism 
> over its replacement with a qualitatively different socialist economic system. 
> 
> Since that time, social democracy has been associated with 
> - Keynesian economics, 
> - the Nordic model, and 
> - welfare states.
>
> Social democracy has been described as 
> the most common form of Western or modern socialism. 
> 
> Amongst social democrats, attitudes towards socialism vary: 
> some retain socialism as a long-term goal, 
> with social democracy being a political and economic democracy 
> supporting a gradualist, reformist, and democratic approach towards achieving socialism. 
> 
> Others view it as an ethical ideal to guide reforms within capitalism. 
> One way modern social democracy can be distinguished from democratic socialism 
> is that social democracy aims to strike a balance 
> by advocating for a mixed market economy where capitalism is regulated 
> to address inequalities through social welfare programs 
> and supports private ownership with a strong emphasis on a well-regulated market. 
> 
> In contrast, democratic socialism places greater emphasis on 
> abolishing private property ownership in favor of full economic democracy 
> by means of cooperative, decentralized, or centralized planning systems. 
> 
> Nevertheless, the distinction remains blurred in colloquial settings, 
> and the two terms are commonly used synonymously.
>
> The Third Way is an offshoot of social democracy 
> which aims to fuse economic liberalism with social democratic economic policies 
> and center-left social policies. 
> 
> It is a reconceptualization of social democracy developed in the 1990s (Schröder, Blair, ...)
> and is embraced by some social democratic parties; 
> with some political scientists and analysts 
> characterising the Third Way as an effectively neoliberal movement.
