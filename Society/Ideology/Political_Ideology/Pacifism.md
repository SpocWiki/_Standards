## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pacifism** is the opposition to war or violence. 
> The word pacifism was coined by the French peace campaigner Émile Arnaud 
> and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901. 
> 
> A related term is ahimsa (to do no harm), 
> which is a core philosophy in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. 
> While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, 
> ancient references abound.
>
> In modern times, interest was revived by Leo Tolstoy in his late works, 
> particularly in The Kingdom of God Is Within You. 
> 
> Mahatma Gandhi propounded the practice of steadfast nonviolent opposition 
> which he called "satyagraha", instrumental in its role in the Indian independence movement. 
> 
> Its effectiveness served as inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, Mary and Charles Beard, James Bevel, Thích Nhất Hạnh, and many others in the civil rights movement.
