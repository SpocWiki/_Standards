> An ideology is a set of beliefs or values attributed to a person or group of persons, 
> especially those held for reasons that are not purely about belief in certain knowledge, 
> in which "practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones". 
> 
> Formerly applied primarily to economic, political, or religious theories and policies, 
> in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, 
> more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory.
>
> The term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, 
> a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher, 
> who conceived it in 1796 as the "science of ideas" 
> to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob. 
> 
> In political science, the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems.
