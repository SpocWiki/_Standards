## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A cradle of civilization is a location and a culture 
> where civilization was developed independently of other civilizations in other locations. 
> 
> A civilization is any complex society characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, 
> and symbolic systems of communication beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems and graphic arts).
>
> Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization: 
> - Mesopotamia, 
> - Ancient Egypt, 
> - Ancient India and 
> - Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in Afro-Eurasia, while the 
> - Caral–Supe civilization of coastal Peru and the 
> - Olmec civilization of Mexico are believed to be the earliest in the Americas. 
> 
> All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance 
> (except possibly Caral–Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). 
> All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus 
> to support the centralized government, political leaders, religious leaders, 
> and public works of the urban centers of the early civilizations.
>
> Less formally, the term "cradle of Western civilization" is often used 
> to refer to other historic ancient civilizations, such as Greece or Rome.
