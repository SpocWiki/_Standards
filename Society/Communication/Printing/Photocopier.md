## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Photocopier** (AKA copier or copy machine, and formerly Xerox machine, the trademark) 
> is a machine that makes copies of documents and other visual images 
> onto paper or plastic film quickly and cheaply. 
> 
> Most modern photocopiers use a technology called xerography, 
> a dry process that uses electrostatic charges on a light-sensitive photoreceptor 
> to first attract and then transfer toner particles (a powder) onto paper in the form of an image.  
> The toner is then fused onto the paper using heat, pressure, or a combination of both.  
> Copiers can also use other technologies, such as inkjet, 
> but xerography is standard for office copying.
>
> Commercial xerographic office photocopying gradually replaced copies made by 
> verifax, photostat, carbon paper, mimeograph machines, and other duplicating machines.
>
> Photocopying is widely used in the business, education, and government sectors.  
> While there have been predictions that photocopiers will eventually become obsolete 
> as information workers increase their use of digital document creation, storage, and distribution 
> and rely less on distributing actual pieces of paper, 
> as of 2015, photocopiers continue to be widely used. 
> 
> During the 1980s, a convergence began in some high-end machines 
> towards what came to be called a multi-function printer: 
> a device that combined the roles of a photocopier, a fax machine, a scanner, 
> and a computer network-connected printer.  
> 
> Low-end machines that can copy and print in color 
> have increasingly dominated the home-office market as their prices fell during the 1990s. 
> High-end color photocopiers capable of heavy-duty handling cycles 
> and large-format printing remain a costly option found primarily in print and design shops.
