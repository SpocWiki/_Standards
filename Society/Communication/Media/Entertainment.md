> **Entertainment** is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience 
> or gives pleasure and delight. 
> 
> It can be an idea or a task, 
> but it is more likely to be one of the activities or events 
> that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.
>
> Although people's attention is held by different things because individuals have different preferences, 
> most forms of entertainment are recognisable and familiar. 
> 
> Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, 
> were supported in royal courts, and developed into sophisticated forms over time, becoming available to all citizens. 
> 
> The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry 
> that records and sells entertainment products. 
> Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, 
> ranging from an individual who chooses private entertainment 
> from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products, 
> to a banquet adapted for two, to any size or type of party with appropriate music and dance, 
> to performances intended for thousands, and even for a global audience.
>
> The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, 
> so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, 
> although many entertainments have a serious purpose. 
> 
> This may be the case in various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire, for example. 
> Hence, there is the possibility that what appears to be entertainment 
> may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.
>
> An important aspect of entertainment is 
> the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. 
> The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of people watching a play, opera, television show, or film; 
> or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, 
> where the participant and audience roles may be routinely reversed. 
> 
> Entertainment can be public or private, 
> involving formal, scripted performances, as in the case of theatre or concerts, 
> or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. 
> 
> Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, 
> evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion, as with stage magic. 
> 
> Films and video games, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. 
> Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.
>
> Some entertainment, such as public executions, is now illegal in most countries. 
> Activities such as fencing or archery, once used in hunting or war, have become spectator sports. 
> In the same way, other activities, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, 
> staged as global competitions, and then broadcast for entertainment. 
> What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work or an act of cruelty by another.
>
> The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over into different media 
> and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. 
> This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.
