## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Communication channel** refers either to a physical transmission medium such as a wire, 
> or to a logical connection over a multiplexed medium 
> such as a radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking. 
> 
> A channel is used for information transfer of, for example, a digital bit stream, 
> **across Space**, from one or several senders to one or several receivers. 
> A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information, 
> often measured by its bandwidth in Hz or its data rate in bits per second.
>
> Communicating an information signal across distance requires some form of pathway or medium. 
> These pathways, called communication channels, use two types of media: 
> Transmission line-based telecommunications cable (e.g. twisted-pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cable) 
> and broadcast (e.g. microwave, satellite, radio, and infrared).
>
> In information theory, a channel refers to a theoretical channel model with certain error characteristics. 
> In this more general view, a storage device is also a communication channel, 
> which can be sent to (written) and received from (reading) 
> and allows communication of an information signal **across time**.
