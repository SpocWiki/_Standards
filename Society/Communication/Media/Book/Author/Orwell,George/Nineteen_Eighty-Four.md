> **Nineteen Eighty-Four** (also published as 1984) is a dystopian novel and cautionary tale by English writer George Orwell. 
> It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. 
> Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, 
> and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. 
> 
> Orwell, a staunch believer in democratic socialism and member of the anti-Stalinist Left, 
> modelled the Britain under authoritarian socialism in the novel on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism 
> and on the very similar practices of both censorship and propaganda in Nazi Germany. 
> More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies 
> and the ways in which they can be manipulated.
>
> The story takes place in an imagined future. The current year is uncertain, but believed to be 1984. 
> Much of the world is in perpetual war. 
> Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, 
> has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, 
> which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality 
> manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. 
> The Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance and, through the Ministry of Truth, 
> historical negationism and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.
>
> The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth 
> who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. 
> Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia, 
> and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. 
> However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, 
> and Smith and Julia are arrested. 
> He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love. 
> He ultimately betrays Julia and is released; he finally realises he loves Big Brother.
>
> Nineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. 
> It also popularised the term "Orwellian" as an adjective, 
> with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including "Big Brother", "doublethink", "Thought Police", "thoughtcrime", "Newspeak", and "2 + 2 = 5". 
> 
> Parallels have been drawn between the novel's subject matter 
> and real life instances of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, 
> and violations of freedom of expression, among other themes. 
> 
> Orwell described his book as a "satire", 
> and a display of the "perversions to which a centralised economy is liable," 
> while also stating he believed "that something resembling it could arrive." 
> 
> Time included the novel on its list of the [[100 best English-language novels]] from 1923 to 2005, 
> and it was placed on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels list, 
> reaching number 13 on the editors' list and number 6 on the readers' list. 
> 
> In 2003, it was listed at number eight on The [[Big Read survey]] by the BBC. 
> It has been adapted across media since its publication, 
> most notably as a film, released in 1984, starring [[../../../movie/Actors/British_Actors/Hurt,John]], Suzanna Hamilton and [[Richard Burton]].
