> **Mary Wollstonecraft** (27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) 
> was a British writer, philosopher, and advocate of women's rights. 
> Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, 
> which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, 
> received more attention than her writing. 
> 
> Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, 
> and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.
>
> During her brief career she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, 
> a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. 
> Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), 
> in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men 
> but appear to be only because they lack education. 
> She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings 
> and imagines a social order founded on reason.
>
> After two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay 
> (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the 
> philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. 
> 
> Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died 11 days after giving birth to her second daughter, 
> Mary Shelley, who became an accomplished writer and the author of Frankenstein.
>
> Wollstonecraft's widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, 
> revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, 
> which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. 
> 
> However, with the emergence of the feminist movement 
> at the turn of the twentieth century, 
> Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality 
> and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.
