> **Alan Moore** (born 18 November 1953) is an English author 
> known primarily for his work in comic books including 
> Watchmen, V for Vendetta, The Ballad of Halo Jones, Swamp Thing, 
> Batman: The Killing Joke, and From Hell. 
> 
> He is widely recognised among his peers and critics 
> as one of the best comic book writers in the English language. 
> 
> Moore has occasionally used such pseudonyms as Curt Vile, 
> Jill de Ray, Brilburn Logue, and Translucia Baboon; 
> also, reprints of some of his work have been credited to The Original Writer 
> when Moore requested that his name be removed.
>
> Moore started writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s  
> before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as 2000 AD and Warrior. 
> 
> He was subsequently picked up by DC Comics as 
> "the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America", 
> where he worked on major characters such as Batman (Batman: The Killing Joke) 
> and Superman ("Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"), 
> substantially developed the character Swamp Thing, 
> and penned original titles such as Watchmen. 
> 
> During that decade, Moore helped to bring about 
> greater social respectability for comics in the United States and United Kingdom. 
> 
> He prefers the term "comic" to "graphic novel". 
> In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream 
> and went independent for a while, working on experimental work 
> such as the epic From Hell and the prose novel Voice of the Fire. 
> 
> He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, 
> working for Image Comics, before developing America's Best Comics, 
> an imprint through which he published works such as 
> The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the occult-based Promethea. 
> In 2016, he published Jerusalem: a 1,266-page experimental novel 
> set in his hometown of Northampton, UK.
>
> Moore is an occultist, ceremonial magician, and anarchist, 
> and has featured such themes in works including Promethea, From Hell, and V for Vendetta, 
> as well as performing avant-garde spoken word occult "workings" 
> with The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels, 
> some of which have been released on CD.
>
> Despite his objections, Moore's works have provided the basis for several Hollywood films, 
> including From Hell (2001), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), 
> V for Vendetta (2005), and Watchmen (2009). 
> 
> Moore has also been referenced in popular culture 
> and has been recognised as an influence on a variety of literary and television figures 
> including Neil Gaiman and Damon Lindelof. 
> 
> He has lived a significant portion of his life in Northampton, England, 
> and he has said in various interviews that his stories 
> draw heavily from his experiences living there.
