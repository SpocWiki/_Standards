## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Rabindranath Thakur  (Bengali: [roˈbindɾonatʰ ˈʈʰakuɾ]; anglicised as **Rabindranath Tagore**  ; 
> 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941) was an Indian Bengali polymath 
> who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer, 
> and painter of the Bengal Renaissance. 
> 
> He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art 
> with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
> 
> Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali. 
> In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win a Nobel Prize in any category, 
> and also the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
> 
> Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; 
> where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent. 
> He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. 
> 
> Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal", 
> Tagore was known by the sobriquets Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.
>
> A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, 
> Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. 
> At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha 
> ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. 
> 
> By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. 
> As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism, 
> he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. 
> As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon 
> that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; 
> his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.
>
> Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. 
> His novels, stories, songs, dance dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. 
> Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) 
> are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—
> for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. 
> 
> His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: 
> India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla". 
> The Sri Lankan national anthem was also inspired by his work. 
> His song "Banglar Mati Banglar Jol" has been adopted as the state anthem of West Bengal.
