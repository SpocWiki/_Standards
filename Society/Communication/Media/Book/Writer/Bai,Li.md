> **Li Bai** (Chinese: 李白; pinyin: Lǐ Bái, 701–762), also pronounced Li Bo, courtesy name Taibai (太白), 
> was a Chinese poet acclaimed as one of the greatest and most important poets of the Tang dynasty 
> and in Chinese history as a whole. 
> 
> He and his friend Du Fu (712–770) were two of the most prominent figures 
> in the flourishing of Chinese poetry under the Tang dynasty, 
> which is often called the "Golden Age of Chinese Poetry". 
> The expression "Three Wonders" denotes Li Bai's poetry, Pei Min's swordplay, and Zhang Xu's calligraphy.
>
> Around 1,000 poems attributed to Li are extant. 
> His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty collection, Heyue yingling ji, 
> compiled in 753 by Yin Fan. 
> Thirty-four of Li Bai's poems are included in the anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, 
> which was first published in the 18th century. 
> 
> Around the same time, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. 
> The poems became models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, 
> the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking. 
> 
> Among the most famous are "Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day" (Chinese: 春日醉起言志), 
> "The Hard Road to Shu" (Chinese: 蜀道难), "Bring in the Wine" (Chinese: 将进酒), 
> and "Quiet Night Thought" (Chinese: 静夜思), which are still taught in schools in China. 
> 
> In the West, multilingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made. 
> His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness and chivalry, 
> and the well-known tale that Li drowned when he reached from his boat 
> to grasp the moon's reflection in the river while he was drunk.
>
> Much of Li's life is reflected in his poems, which are about places he visited; 
> friends whom he saw off on journeys to distant locations, perhaps never to meet again; 
> his own dream-like imaginings, embroidered with shamanic overtones; 
> current events of which he had news; descriptions of nature, perceived as if in a timeless moment; and more. 
> 
> However, of particular importance are the changes in China during his lifetime. 
> His early poems were written in a "golden age" of internal peace and prosperity, 
> under an emperor who actively promoted and participated in the arts. 
> 
> This ended with the beginning of the rebellion of general An Lushan, 
> which eventually left most of Northern China devastated by war and famine. 
> Li's poems during this period take on new tones and qualities. 
> 
> Unlike his younger friend Du Fu, Li did not live to see the end of the chaos. 
> Li Bai is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.
