> **Johann Wolfgang von Goethe** (28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German polymath, 
> who is widely regarded as the greatest and most influential writer in the German language. 
> 
> His work has had a profound and wide-ranging influence on Western literary, political, 
> and philosophical thought from the late 18th century to the present day. 
> A poet, playwright, novelist, scientist, statesman, theatre director, and critic, 
> his works include plays, poetry and aesthetic criticism, as well as treatises on botany, anatomy, and color.
>
> Goethe took up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, 
> The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), and joined a thriving intellectual and cultural environment 
> under the patronage of Duchess Anna Amalia that had already included Abel Seyler's theatre company 
> and Christoph Martin Wieland, and that formed the basis of Weimar Classicism. 
> 
> He was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782. 
> Goethe was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. 
> During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's privy council (1776–1785), 
> sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, 
> and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. 
> He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace.
>
> Goethe's first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, 
> was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. 
> In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, 
> and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, 
> whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. 
> During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; 
> the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. 
> 
> His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, 
> Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, 
> and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism.
>
> The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship 
> one of the four greatest novels ever written, 
> while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson 
> selected Goethe as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name 
> (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare). 
> 
> Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, 
> notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe (1836). 
> His poems were set to music by many composers 
> including Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Liszt, Wagner, and Mahler.
