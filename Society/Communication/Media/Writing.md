> **Writing** is the act of creating a persistent representation of language. 
> A writing system includes a particular set of symbols called a script, 
> as well as the rules by which they encode a particular spoken language. 
> 
> Every written language arises from a corresponding spoken language; 
> while the use of language is universal across human societies, **most spoken languages are not written**.
>
> Writing is a cognitive and social activity involving neuropsychological and physical processes. 
> The outcome of this activity, also called writing (or a text) 
> is a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented symbols. 
> 
> Reading is the corresponding process of interpreting a written text, with the interpreter referred to as a reader.
>
> In general, writing systems do not constitute languages in and of themselves, but rather a means of encoding language such that it can be read by others across time and space. While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend the capacities of spoken language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries). Writing can also impact what knowledge people acquire, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, elaborate on, reconsider, and revise.
