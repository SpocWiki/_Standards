> A **Cartoon** is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, 
> in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved, 
> but the modern usage usually refers to either: 
> - an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; 
> - or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. 
> Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist, 
> and in the second sense they are usually called an animator.
>
> The concept originated in the Middle Ages, 
> and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, 
> such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. 
> 
> In the 19th century, beginning in Punch magazine in 1843, 
> cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous artworks in magazines and newspapers. 
> Then it also was used for political cartoons and comic strips. 
> When the medium developed, in the early 20th century, 
> it began to refer to animated films that resembled print cartoons.
