> **Paint** is a material or mixture that, 
> when applied to a solid material and allowed to dry, adds a film-like layer. 
> 
> As art, this is used to create an image or images known as a painting. 
> Paint can be made in many colors and types. 
> Most paints are either oil-based or water-based, and each has distinct characteristics.
>
> Primitive forms of paint were used tens of thousands of years ago in cave paintings.
>
> Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than oil-based paint. 
> Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently 
> based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house).
