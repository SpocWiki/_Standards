> The Scream is an art composition created by Norwegian artist [[../Munch,Edvard|Edvard Munch]] in 1893. 
> 
> The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik ('Scream'), 
> and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur 
> ('The Scream of Nature'). 
> 
> The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, 
> seen as representing a profound experience of existential dread related to the human condition. 
> Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.
>
> Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset 
> when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the clouds "a blood red". 
> He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". 
> 
> Scholars have located the spot along a fjord path overlooking Oslo 
> and have suggested various explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, 
> ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption 
> to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.
>
> Munch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, 
> as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. 
> 
> Both painted versions have been stolen from public museums, but since recovered. 
> In 2012, one of the pastel versions 
> commanded the highest nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction at that time.
