> Joan Miró i Ferrà (mi-ROH, US mee-ROH; Catalan: [ʒuˈan miˈɾoj fəˈra]; 20 April 1893 – 25 December 1983) 
> was a Catalan painter, sculptor and ceramist from Spain. 
> 
> A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundació Joan Miró, 
> was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, 
> and another, the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró, was established in his adoptive city of Palma, Mallorca in 1981.
>
> Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as  Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult-to-classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an "assassination of painting" in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.
