## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Starry Night, often called simply Starry Night, is an oil-on-canvas painting 
> by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. 
> 
> Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window 
> of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, 
> with the addition of an imaginary village. 
> 
> It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City 
> since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. 
> 
> Described as a "touchstone of modern art", 
> The Starry Night has been regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western canon.
>
> The painting was created in mid-June 1889, 
> inspired by the view from Van Gogh’s bedroom window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum. 
> 
> The former monastery functioned as a mental asylum, 
> where Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself on 8 May 1889, following a mental breakdown 
> and his infamous act of self-mutilation that occurred in late December 1888. 
> 
> Catering to wealthy patients, the facility was less than half full 
> at the time of Van Gogh's admission, allowing the artist access to 
> both a second-story bedroom and a ground-floor studio. 
> 
> During his year-long stay, he remained highly productive, creating Irises, 
> a self-portrait, and The Starry Night.
>
> The painting's celestial elements include Venus, which was visible in the sky at the time, 
> though the moon’s depiction is not astronomically accurate. 
> 
> The cypress trees in the foreground were exaggerated in scale compared to other works. 
> Van Gogh's letters suggest he viewed them primarily in aesthetic rather than symbolic terms. 
> The village in the painting is an imaginary addition, 
> based on sketches rather than the actual landscape seen from the asylum.
>
> The Starry Night has been subject to various interpretations, 
> ranging from religious symbolism to representations of Van Gogh’s emotional turmoil. 
> 
> Some art historians link the swirling sky to contemporary astronomical discoveries, 
> while others see it as an expression of Van Gogh’s personal struggles. 
> 
> Van Gogh himself was critical of the painting, 
> referring to it as a "failure" in letters to his brother, Theo. 
> The artwork was inherited by Theo upon Vincent's death. 
> Following Theo's death six months after Vincent's, the work was owned by Theo's widow, Jo, 
> who sold it to Émile Schuffenecker in 1901, who sold it back to Jo in 1905. 
> 
> From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by one Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam. 
> Paul Rosenberg bought it from van Stolk in 1938 
> and sold it (by exchange) to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1941, 
> which rarely loans it out. 
> 
> Scientific analysis of the painting has confirmed Van Gogh’s use of 
> ultramarine and cobalt blue for the sky, 
> with indian yellow and zinc yellow for the stars and moon.
