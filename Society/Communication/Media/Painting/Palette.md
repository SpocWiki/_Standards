> A palette is a surface on which a painter arranges and mixes paints. 
> 
> A palette is made of materials such as wood, paper, glass, ceramic or plastic, 
> and can vary greatly in size and shape. 
> 
> Watercolor palettes are generally made of plastic or porcelain 
> in a rectangular or wheel format, 
> and have built in wells and mixing areas for colors. 
> 
> For acrylic painting, "stay wet" palettes exist, 
> which prevent the paints from drying out and becoming inert.
>
> A classical palette is most often oval, but can also be rectangular, 
> and is tapered to ensure optimal distribution of weight. 
> 
> It has a thumbhole and insert for brushes, 
> and is designed to be held in the non-dominant hand 
> while the other is used to mix and paint. 
> 
> However, some well-known artists have used more unconventional palettes; 
> for instance, Picasso used a sheet of newspaper.
>
> Palettes are also a universal symbol of painting and art in general, 
> alongside paintbrushes, for example in the symbol of Microsoft Paint.
