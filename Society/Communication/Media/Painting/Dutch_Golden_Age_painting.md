## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Dutch Golden Age painting is the painting of the Dutch Golden Age, 
> a period in Dutch history roughly spanning the 17th century, 
> during and after the later part of the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) for Dutch independence.
>
> The new Dutch Republic was the most prosperous nation in Europe 
> and led European trade, science, and art. 
> 
> The northern Netherlandish provinces that made up the new state 
> had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. 
> 
> The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, 
> and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, 
> meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself almost entirely, 
> a task in which it was very largely successful. 
> 
> The painting of religious subjects declined very sharply, 
> but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.
>
> Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age 
> is included in the general European period of Baroque painting, 
> and often shows many of its characteristics, 
> most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, 
> including that of neighbouring Flanders. 
> Most work, including that for which the period is best known, 
> reflects the traditions of detailed realism inherited from Early Netherlandish painting.
>
> A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct genres of paintings, 
> with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. 
> 
> The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, 
> and the period from then until the French invasion of 1672 is the core of Golden Age painting.  
> 
> Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, 
> genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, 
> and often a particular sub-type within these categories. 
> 
> Many of these types of subjects were new in Western painting, 
> and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.
