> The **Performing arts** are arts such as music, dance, and drama which are performed for an audience. 
> They are different from the visual arts, which involve the use of paint, canvas 
> or various materials to create physical or static art objects. 
> Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, 
> including theatre, music, and dance.
>
> Theatre, music, gymnastics, object manipulation, and other kinds of performances are present in all human cultures. The history of music and dance date to pre-historic times whereas circus skills date to at least Ancient Egypt. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose-built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses; on open air stages at festivals; on stages in tents, as in circuses; or on the street.

> Live performances before an audience are a form of entertainment.
