Communication across Time requires persistent Storage and has Volume as primary Constraint. 
Open, efficient Formats are also important, usually dedicated to the Media Content. 

The Lack of large Storage Media results in the loss of many historical Radio-Broadcasts since the 1920 
and TV Productions since the 1940s. 
Only Film and News on Celluloid and, starting in the 1960s later on Magnetic Tape could conserve larger portions. 

Most Radio and TV Broadcasts from earlier times were not recorded.
