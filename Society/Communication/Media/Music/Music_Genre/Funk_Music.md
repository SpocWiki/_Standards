## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Funk** is a music genre that originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s 
> when musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music 
> through a mixture of various music genres 
> that were popular among African-Americans in the mid-20th century. 
> 
> It deemphasizes melody and chord progressions 
> and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bassline played by an electric bassist 
> and a drum part played by a percussionist, often at slower tempos than other popular music. 
> 
> Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove 
> with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves that create a "hypnotic" and "danceable" feel. 
> It uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, 
> such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, 
> and dominant seventh chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.
>
> Funk originated in the mid-1960s, 
> with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—
> with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure ("The One"), 
> and the application of swung 16th notes  and syncopation on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs. 
> 
> Rock- and psychedelia-influenced musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic 
> fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s. 
> Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, 
> including Kool and the Gang, Ohio Players, Fatback Band, Jimmy Castor Bunch, Earth, Wind & Fire, B.T. Express, Shalamar, One Way, Lakeside, Dazz Band, The Gap Band, Slave, Aurra, Roger Troutman & Zapp, Con Funk Shun, Cameo, Bar-Kays, The Brothers Johnson and Chic. 
>
> Funk derivatives include 
> - avant-funk, an avant-garde strain of funk; 
> - boogie, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal; 
> - G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and psychedelic funk; 
> - Timba, a form of funky Cuban dance music; and 
> - funk jam. 
> 
> It is also the main influence of Washington go-go, a funk subgenre. 
> Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and electronic dance music.
