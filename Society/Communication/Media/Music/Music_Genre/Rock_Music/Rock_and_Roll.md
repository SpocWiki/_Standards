> **rock and roll** (often written as rock & roll, rock-n-roll, and rock 'n' roll) 
> is a genre of popular music that evolved in the USA during the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
> It originated from African American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, 
> boogie-woogie, electric blues, gospel, and jump blues, as well as from country music. 
> 
> While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s 
> and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.
>
> By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into 
> "the more encompassing international style known as rock music, 
> though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll". 
> For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.
>
> In the earliest rock and roll styles, 
> either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. 
> These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the electric guitar in the mid-to-late 1950s. 
> The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, 
> almost always provided by a snare drum. 
> Minimal blues chord progressions such as the twelve-bar blues are commonly used. 
> 
> Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) 
> and a double bass (string bass). 
> After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars ("Fender bass") and drum kits became popular in classic rock.
>
> Rock and roll had a profound influence on contemporary 
> American lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, 
> and is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. 
> 
> Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the civil rights movement, 
> because of its widespread appeal to both Black American and White American teenagers.
