> In music theory, **Counterpoint** is the relationship of two or more simultaneous musical lines 
> (also called voices) that are harmonically dependent on each other, 
> yet independent in rhythm and melodic contour. 
> 
> The term originates from the Latin punctus contra punctum meaning "point against point", 
> i.e. "note against note". 
> 
> John Rahn describes counterpoint as follows:
> It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs 
> that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. 
> The internal structures that create each of the voices separately 
> must contribute to the emergent structure of the polyphony, 
> which in turn must reinforce and comment on the structures of the individual voices. 
> The way that is accomplished in detail is ... 'counterpoint'.
>
> Counterpoint has been most commonly identified in the European classical tradition, 
> strongly developing during the Renaissance and in much of the common practice period, 
> especially in the Baroque period. 
> 
> In Western pedagogy, counterpoint is taught through a system of species (see below).
>
> There are several different forms of counterpoint, 
> including imitative counterpoint and free counterpoint. 
> Imitative counterpoint involves the repetition of a main melodic idea across different vocal parts, 
> with or without variation. 
> 
> Compositions written in free counterpoint 
> often incorporate non-traditional harmonies and chords, chromaticism and dissonance.
