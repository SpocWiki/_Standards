## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ragtime**, also spelled rag-time or rag time, is a musical style that was popular 
> and heavily influenced musical genres such as the Blues, 
> and was seen in the United States from the 1890s to 1910s. 
> 
> Its signature trait is its syncopated or "ragged" rhythm. 
> Ragtime was popularized during the early 20th century by composers such as 
> Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb. 
> 
> Ragtime pieces (often called "rags") are typically composed for and performed on the piano, 
> though the genre has been adapted for a variety of instruments and styles.
>
> Ragtime music originated within African American communities in the late 19th century 
> and became a distinctly American form of popular music. 
> 
> It is closely related to marches. 
> 
> Ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, 
> often arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. 
> 
> Scott Joplin, known as the "King of Ragtime", 
> gained fame through compositions like "Maple Leaf Rag" and "The Entertainer". 
> 
> Ragtime influenced early jazz, Harlem stride piano, Piedmont blues, 
> and early 20th century European classical composers such as Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, and Igor Stravinsky. 
> 
> Despite being overshadowed by jazz in the 1920s, 
> ragtime has experienced several revivals, notably in the 1950s and 1970s 
> (the latter renaissance due in large part to the use of "The Entertainer" in the film The Sting). 
> 
> The music was distributed primarily through sheet music and piano rolls, 
> with some compositions adapted for other instruments and ensembles.
