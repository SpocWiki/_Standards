> **Bebop** or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States. 
> The style features compositions characterized by a fast tempo (usually exceeding 200 bpm), 
> complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, 
> instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, 
> the use of scales, and occasional references to the melody.
>
> Bebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians 
> expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing music-style 
> to a new "musician's music" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening.  
> 
> As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. 
> Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, 
> extended chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. 
> 
> Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. 
> Whereas the key ensemble of the swing music era was the big band of 16â€“18 musicians playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone (alto or tenor), trumpet, piano, guitar, double bass, and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the "head") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.

> Some of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are alto sax player Charlie Parker; tenor sax players Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, and James Moody; clarinet player Buddy DeFranco; trumpeters Fats Navarro, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie; pianists Bud Powell, Barry Harris and Thelonious Monk; electric guitarist Charlie Christian; and drummers Kenny Clarke, Max Roach, and Art Blakey.
