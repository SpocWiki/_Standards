> Easy listening (including mood music) is a popular music genre and radio format 
> that was most popular during the 1950s to the 1970s. 
> 
> It is related to middle of the road (MOR) music 
> and encompasses instrumental recordings of standards, hit songs, non-rock vocals 
> and instrumental covers of selected popular rock songs. 
> 
> It mostly concentrates on music that pre-dates the rock and roll era, 
> characteristically on music from the 1940s and 1950s. 
> 
> It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental beautiful music format by its variety of styles, 
> including a percentage of vocals, arrangements and tempos to fit various parts of the broadcast day.
>
> Easy listening music is often confused with lounge music, 
> but while it was popular in some of the same venues 
> it was meant to be listened to for enjoyment rather than as background sound.
