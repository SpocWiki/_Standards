## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In music, a canon is a contrapuntal (counterpoint-based) compositional technique 
> that employs a melody with one or more imitations of the melody played after a given duration 
> (e.g., quarter rest, one measure, etc.). 
> 
> The initial melody is called the leader (or dux), 
> while the imitative melody, which is played in a different voice, is called the follower (or comes). 
> The follower must imitate the leader, either as an exact replication of its rhythms and intervals 
> or some transformation thereof. 
> 
> Repeating canons in which all voices are musically identical are called rounds—
> familiar singalong versions of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and "Frère Jacques" 
> that call for each successive group of voices to begin the same song 
> a bar or two after the previous group began are popular examples.
>
> An accompanied canon is a canon accompanied by one or more additional independent parts 
> that do not imitate the melody.
