## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Peking opera, or Beijing opera (Chinese: 京劇; pinyin: Jīngjù), 
> is the most dominant form of Chinese opera, which combines 
> instrumental music, vocal performance, mime, martial arts, dance and acrobatics. 
> 
> It arose in Beijing in the mid-Qing dynasty (1644–1912) 
> and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. 
> 
> The form was extremely popular in the Qing court 
> and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China. 
> Major performance troupes are based in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai. 
> The art form is also preserved in Taiwan, where it is also known as Guójù (Chinese: 國劇; lit. 'National opera'). 
> It has also spread to other regions such as the United States and Japan.
>
> Peking opera features four main role types, 
> sheng (gentlemen), dan (women), jing (rough men), and chou (clowns). 
> 
> Performing troupes often have several of each variety, 
> as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers. 
> 
> With their elaborate and colorful costumes, 
> performers are the only focal points on Peking opera characteristically sparse stage. 
> 
> They use the skills of speech, song, dance and combat 
> in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. 
> 
> Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. 
> Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions 
> that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. 
> 
> The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. 
> The music of Peking opera can be divided into the xīpí (西皮) and èrhuáng (二黄) styles. 
> Melodies include arias, fixed-tune melodies and percussion patterns. 
> The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, 
> which are based on Chinese history, folklore and, increasingly, contemporary life.
>
> Traditional Peking opera was denounced as "feudalistic" and "bourgeois" 
> during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) 
> and replaced mostly with the revolutionary operas until the period's end. 
> 
> After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. 
> In recent years, Peking opera has responded to sagging audience numbers 
> by attempting reforms, including improving performance quality, 
> adapting new performance elements, shortening works, and performing new and original plays.
