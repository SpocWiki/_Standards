## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Romantic music is a stylistic movement in Western Classical music 
> associated with the period of the 19th century commonly referred to as the Romantic era 
> (or Romantic period). 
> 
> It is closely related to the broader concept of Romanticism—
> the intellectual, artistic, and literary movement that became prominent in Western culture 
> from about 1798 until 1837.
>
> Romantic composers sought to create music that was individualistic, emotional, dramatic, 
> and often programmatic; reflecting broader trends within the movements of Romantic 
> literature, poetry, art, and philosophy. 
> 
> Romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by (or else sought to evoke) non-musical stimuli, 
> such as nature, literature, poetry, super-natural elements, or the fine arts. 
> It included features such as increased chromaticism and moved away from traditional forms.
