> Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instruments—
> traditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room. 
> 
> Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, 
> with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, 
> in which each string part is played by a number of performers). 
> However, by convention, it usually does not include solo instrument performances.
>
> Because of its intimate nature, chamber music has been described as "the music of friends". 
> For more than 100 years, chamber music was 
> played primarily by amateur musicians in their homes, and even today, when 
> chamber music performance has migrated from the home to the concert hall, 
> many musicians, amateur and professional, still play chamber music for their own pleasure. 
> 
> Playing chamber music requires special skills, both musical and social, 
> that differ from the skills required for playing solo or symphonic works.
>
> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described chamber music (specifically, string quartet music) 
> as "four rational people conversing". 
> 
> This conversational paradigm – which refers to the way 
> one instrument introduces a melody or motif 
> and then other instruments subsequently "respond" with a similar motif – 
> has been a thread woven through the history of chamber music composition 
> from the end of the 18th century to the present. 
> 
> The analogy to conversation recurs in descriptions and analyses of chamber music compositions.
