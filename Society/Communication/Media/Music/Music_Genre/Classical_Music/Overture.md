> **Overture** (from French ouverture, lit. "opening") is a music instrumental introduction 
> to a ballet, opera, or oratorio in the 17th century. 
> 
> During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn 
> composed overtures which were independent, self-existing, instrumental, 
> programmatic works that foreshadowed genres such as the symphonic poem. 
> These were "at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme".
>
> The idea of an instrumental opening to opera existed during the 17th century. 
> Peri's Euridice opens with a brief instrumental ritornello, 
> and Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1607) opens with a toccata, 
> in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets. 
> 
> More important was the prologue, consisting of sung dialogue between allegorical characters 
> which introduced the overarching themes of the stories depicted.
