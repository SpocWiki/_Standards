> A **Prelude** (German: Präludium or Vorspiel; Latin: praeludium; French: prélude; 
> Italian: preludio) is a short piece of music, the form of which may vary from piece to piece. 
> 
> While, during the Baroque era, for example, it may have served as an introduction to succeeding movements of a work that were usually longer and more complex, it may also have been a stand-alone piece of work during the Romantic era. It generally features a small number of rhythmic and melodic motifs that recur through the piece. Stylistically, the prelude is improvisatory in nature. The term may also refer to an overture, particularly to those seen in an opera or an oratorio.
>
> A prelude and fugue generally consists of two movements in the same key for solo keyboard. 
> In classical music, the combination of prelude and fugue is one with a long history.  
> Many composers have written works of this kind.  The use of this format is generally inspired by Johann Sebastian Bach's two books of preludes and fugues — The Well-Tempered Clavier — completed in 1722 and 1742 respectively. Bach, however, was not the first to compose such a set: Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer wrote a 20-key cycle in his 1702 work Ariadne musica.
