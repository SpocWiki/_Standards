> Classical antiquity, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, 
> is the period of cultural European history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD. 
> 
> It comprises the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, 
> known together as the Greco-Roman world, 
> which played a major role in shaping the culture of the Mediterranean Basin. 
> It is the period during which ancient Greece and Rome flourished 
> and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. 
> Classical antiquity was succeeded by the period now known as late antiquity.
>
> Conventionally, it is often considered to 
> begin with the earliest recorded Epic Greek poetry of Homer (8th–7th centuries BC) and 
> end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. 
> 
> Such a wide span of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. 
> Classical antiquity may also refer to an idealized vision among later people 
> of what was, in Edgar Allan Poe's words, "the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome".
>
> The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Near East, 
> was the basis of art, philosophy, society, and education in the Mediterranean and Near East 
> until the Roman imperial period. 
> 
> The Romans preserved, imitated, and spread this culture throughout Europe, 
> until they were able to compete with it. 
> This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the 
> language, politics, law, educational systems, philosophy, science, warfare, literature, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art and architecture of both the Western, and through it, the modern world.
>
> Surviving fragments of classical culture helped produce a revival 
> beginning during the 14th century which later came to be known as the Renaissance, 
> and various neo-classical revivals occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries.
