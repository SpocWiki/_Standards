> The term expressionism "was probably first applied to music in 1918, especially to Schoenberg", 
> because like the painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) he avoided "traditional forms of beauty" 
> to convey powerful feelings in his music. 
> 
> Theodor Adorno interprets the expressionist movement in music as 
> seeking to "eliminate all of traditional music's conventional elements, everything formulaically rigid". 
> 
> This he sees as analogous "to the literary ideal of the 'scream.' " 
> As well Adorno sees expressionist music as 
> seeking "the truthfulness of subjective feeling without illusions, disguises or euphemisms". 
> 
> Adorno also describes it as concerned with the unconscious, 
> and states that "the depiction of fear lies at the centre" of expressionist music, 
> with dissonance predominating, so that the "harmonious, affirmative element of art is banished". 
> 
> Expressionist music would "thus reject the depictive, sensual qualities 
> that had come to be associated with impressionist music. 
> It would endeavor instead to realize its own purely musical nature—
> in part by disregarding compositional conventions 
> that placed 'outer' restrictions on the expression of 'inner' visions".
>
> Expressionist music often features a high level of dissonance, extreme contrasts of dynamics, 
> constant changing of textures, "distorted" melodies and harmonies, and angular melodies with wide leaps.
