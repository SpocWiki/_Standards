## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Gregorian chant is the central tradition of Western plainchant, 
> a form of monophonic, unaccompanied sacred song in Latin 
> (and occasionally Greek) of the Roman Catholic Church. 
> 
> Gregorian chant developed mainly in western and central Europe 
> during the 9th and 10th centuries, with later additions and redactions. 
> 
> Although popular legend credits Pope Gregory I with inventing Gregorian chant, 
> scholars believe that he only ordered a compilation of melodies 
> throughout the whole Christian world, after having instructed his emissaries 
> in the Schola cantorum, where the neumatical notation was perfected, 
> with the result of most of those melodies being a later Carolingian synthesis 
> of the Old Roman chant and Gallican chant.
>
> Gregorian chants were organized initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 modes. 
> Typical melodic features include a characteristic ambitus, 
> and also characteristic intervallic patterns relative to a referential mode final, 
> incipits and cadences, the use of reciting tones at a particular distance from the final, 
> around which the other notes of the melody revolve, 
> and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called centonization 
> to create families of related chants. 
> 
> The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of 
> conjunct and disjunct tetrachords, producing a larger pitch system called the gamut. 
> The chants can be sung by using six-note patterns called hexachords. 
> Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using neumes, an early form of musical notation from which the modern four-line and five-line staff developed. 
> Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as organum, 
> were an early stage in the development of Western polyphony.
>
> Gregorian chant was traditionally sung by choirs of men and boys in churches, 
> or by women and men of religious orders in their chapels. 
> 
> It is the music of the Roman Rite, performed in the Mass and the monastic Office. 
> Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized 
> the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West 
> to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, 
> Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, 
> and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. 
> Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, 
> the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship.
