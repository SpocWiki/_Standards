> Medieval music encompasses the sacred and secular music of Western Europe 
> during the Middle Ages, from approximately the 6th to 15th centuries. 
> 
> It is the first and longest major era of Western classical music 
> and is followed by the Renaissance music; 
> 
> the two eras comprise what musicologists generally term as early music, 
> preceding the common practice period. 
> 
> Following the traditional division of the Middle Ages, 
> medieval music can be divided into 
> - Early (500–1000), 
> - High (1000–1300), and 
> - Late (1300–1400) medieval music.
>
> Medieval music includes liturgical music used for the church, other sacred music, 
> and secular or non-religious music. 
> 
> Much medieval music is purely vocal music, such as Gregorian chant. 
>
> The medieval period saw the creation and adaptation of systems of music notation 
> which enabled creators to document and transmit musical ideas more easily, 
> although notation coexisted with and complemented oral tradition.
