> **Supertramp** were a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. 
> They experienced their greatest global success in 1979 with their sixth album Breakfast in America. 
> Marked by the individual songwriting of founders Roger Hodgson (vocals, keyboards and guitars) 
> and Rick Davies (vocals and keyboards), 
> the group were distinguished for blending progressive rock and pop styles 
> as well as for a sound that relied heavily on Wurlitzer electric piano. 
> 
> The group's lineup changed numerous times throughout their career, 
> with Davies being the only constant member throughout its history. 
> The classic lineup, which lasted ten years from 1973 to 1983, comprised Davies, Hodgson, 
> Dougie Thomson (bass), Bob Siebenberg (drums) and John Helliwell (saxophone).
>
> The group found no success with their first two albums; 
> however, after a lineup change with their third album, 
> Crime of the Century (1974) became their first success. 
> 
> Initially a prog-rock group, they began moving towards a more pop-oriented sound 
> with the album, the first with the classic lineup. 
> The band reached their commercial peak with 1979's Breakfast in America, 
> which yielded the international top 10 singles "The Logical Song", "Breakfast in America", 
> "Goodbye Stranger" and "Take the Long Way Home". 
> Their other top 40 hits included "Dreamer" (1974), "Give a Little Bit" (1977) 
> and "It's Raining Again" (1982). In 1982 the band released ...Famous Last Words... 
> the last album to feature Hodgson, who left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career. 
> 
> The band continued with Davies as the sole leader and released two albums until 1988, 
> after which they disbanded and periodically reformed in various configurations, 
> touring with two further albums, Some Things Never Change (1997) and Slow Motion (2002) 
> resulting from these.
>
> As of 2007, Supertramp album sales exceeded 60 million. 
> They attained significant popularity in North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. 
> Their highest sales levels were in Canada, 
> where they had two diamond-certified (ten-times platinum) albums 
> (Crime of the Century and Breakfast in America), 
> and their only number 1 singles anywhere ("The Logical Song" and "Dreamer").
