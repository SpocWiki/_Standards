> Rush was a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto in 1968 
> that primarily comprised [[Geddy Lee]] (vocals, bass guitar, keyboards), 
> Alex Lifeson (guitar) and Neil Peart (drums, percussion). 
> 
> The band's original line-up comprised Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, 
> and bassist and vocalist Jeff Jones, whom Lee immediately replaced. 
> After Lee joined, the band went through a few line-up changes 
> before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, 
> who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album; 
> this line-up was kept intact for the remainder of the band's career.
>
> Rush first achieved moderate success with their second album, Fly by Night (1975). 
> The commercial failure of their next album Caress of Steel, 
> released seven months after Fly by Night, 
> resulted in the band almost getting dropped from their then-record label Mercury Records. 
> Rush's fourth album, 2112 (1976), reignited their popularity, 
> becoming their first album to enter the top five on the Canadian charts. 
> 
> Their next two albums, A Farewell to Kings (1977) and Hemispheres (1978), were also successful, 
> with the former becoming Rush's first to enter the UK charts. 
> The band saw their furthest commercial success throughout the 1980s and 1990s, 
> with most albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including 
> Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984), 
> Roll the Bones (1991), Counterparts (1993) and Test for Echo (1996). 
> 
> Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, 
> after which the band went on a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. 
> The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: 
> Vapor Trails (2002), Snakes & Arrows (2007), and Clockwork Angels (2012). 
> 
> Rush performed their final concerts in 2015, with Peart retiring from music later that year. 
> Lifeson later commented in January 2018 that 
> the band decided not to resume activity following the R40 Tour, 
> which was later cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, 
> a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67. 
> 
> Lee and Lifeson have continued to periodically work together since Peart's death, 
> including performing at the 25th anniversary celebration of South Park 
> and tributes to then-recently deceased Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins in 2022.
>
> Rush were known for their virtuosic musicianship, complex compositions 
> and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. 
> 
> The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, 
> later moving into progressive rock, 
> then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, 
> before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. 
> 
> Clockwork Angels marked a return to progressive rock. 
> The members of Rush have been acknowledged as 
> some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments,
