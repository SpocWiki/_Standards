> John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is an English retired musician 
> who was the bass guitarist for the rock band Queen. 
> He wrote several songs for the group, including Top 10 hits "You're My Best Friend", 
> "Another One Bites the Dust" and "I Want to Break Free"; co-wrote "Under Pressure", 
> "Friends Will Be Friends" and "One Vision"; 
> and he was involved in the band's financial management.
>
> Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicester playing bass guitar in a local band, The Opposition, 
> before moving to study electronics at Chelsea College, London. 
> He joined Queen in 1971 on the strength of his musical and electronic skills, 
> particularly the home-made Deacy Amp 
> which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. 
> 
> From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, 
> several of which became hits. 
> As well as bass guitar, Deacon played some guitar, keyboards and piano on Queen's studio work.
>
> After the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991 and the following year's Tribute Concert, 
> Deacon performed only sporadically with the remaining members of Queen 
> before retiring from the music industry in 1997 
> after recording "No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)". 
> He has not performed on any of the other projects that the two remaining members, 
> Brian May and Roger Taylor, have put together.
>
> He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Queen in 2001 
> and into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003.
