The Video alludes to the [[../../../movie/Horror-Movie/Carrie(1976_film)]]  
Voice switches between Metallica and briefly imitates of Linkin Park Singer [[../../../../../../../_Standards/Society/Communication/Media/Music/Musician/Music~Band/Linkin_Park/Bennington,Chester|Chester Bennington]]. 
The Tempo is slow, the riffs similar to AC/DC-s Hells Bells.

> Until a 2017 lawsuit filed by former members of Ghost, 
> the band's frontman, [[Tobias Forge]], performed incognito under the persona of "Papa Emeritus", 
> a character known for its "demonic anti-pope" imagery.
