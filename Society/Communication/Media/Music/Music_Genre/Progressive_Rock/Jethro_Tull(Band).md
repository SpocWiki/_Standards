> Jethro Tull are  a British rock band formed in Blackpool, Lancashire in 1967. 
> Initially playing blues rock and jazz fusion, 
> the band soon incorporated elements of English folk music, hard rock and classical music, 
> forging a signature progressive rock sound. 
> The group's founder, bandleader, principal composer, lead vocalist, 
> and only constant member is Ian Anderson, who also plays flute and acoustic guitar. 
> 
> The group has featured a succession of musicians throughout the decades, 
> including significant contributors such as guitarists Mick Abrahams and Martin Barre 
> (with Barre being the longest-serving member besides Anderson); bassists Glenn Cornick, 
> Jeffrey Hammond, John Glascock, Dave Pegg, Jonathan Noyce, and David Goodier; 
> drummers Clive Bunker, Barrie "Barriemore" Barlow and Doane Perry; 
> and keyboardists John Evan, Dee Palmer, Peter-John Vettese, Andrew Giddings, and John O'Hara. 
>
> The band achieved moderate recognition in the London club scene 
> and released their debut album, This Was, in 1968. 
> After a line-up change which saw original guitarist Mick Abrahams replaced by Martin Barre, 
> the band released a folk-tinged second album, Stand Up, in 1969. 
> Stand Up, which reached No. 1 in the UK, gave the band their first commercial success, 
> and regular tours of the UK and the US followed. 
> Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock starting with Aqualung (1971), 
> which went on to become the band's most commercially-successful album. 
> Their musical style shifted again to folk rock in the late 1970s. 
> In the early 1980s the band underwent a major line-up change 
> and began to lean into electronic rock. 
> The band won their sole Grammy Award for the 1987 album Crest of a Knave, 
> which saw them returning to a hard-rock style. 
> Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60 million albums worldwide, 
> with 11 gold and 5 platinum albums. 
> They have been described by Rolling Stone as 
> "one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands".
>
> The band ceased studio recording activity in the 2000s, 
> but continued to tour until splitting in 2011. 
> Following the band's split, Anderson and Barre continued to record and tour as solo artists, 
> with Anderson's band billed variously as both "Jethro Tull" and "Ian Anderson" solo. 
> 
> Anderson said in 2014 that Jethro Tull had come "more or less to an end". 
> Starting in 2017 however, Anderson revived the Jethro Tull name 
> and returned to releasing new studio albums in the 2020s. 
> The current group includes musicians 
> who were part of Jethro Tull during the last years of its initial run, 
> as well as newer musicians associated with Anderson's solo band, without Barre's involvement.
