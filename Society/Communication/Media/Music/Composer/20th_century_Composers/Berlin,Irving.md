> Irving Berlin (born Israel Isidore Beilin; May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) 
> was a jewish Russian-born American composer and songwriter. 
> 
> His music forms a large part of the Great American Songbook. 
> Berlin received numerous honors including an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, 
> and a Tony Award. 
> He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Gerald R. Ford in 1977. 
> The broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite stated he "helped write the story of this country, 
> capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives".
>
> Born in Imperial Russia, Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. 
> His family left Russia to escape pogroms, one of which destroyed their village. 
> He published his first song, "Marie from Sunny Italy", in 1907, 
> receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, 
> and became known as the composer of numerous international hits, 
> starting with 1911's "[[Berlin,Irving/Alexander's_Ragtime_Band|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]". 
> 
> He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway.  
> For much of his career, Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player 
> that he could only play in the key of F-sharp; 
> he used his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever 
> when he needed to play in keys other than F-sharp. 
> 
> He was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: 
> uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being 
> to "reach the heart of the average American", who he saw as the "real soul of the country".
>
> He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, 
> which made him famous before he turned thirty. 
> During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, 
> including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original Hollywood films, 
> with his songs nominated eight times for [[../../../Movie/Academy_Award|Academy Awards]]. 
> Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including "[[Berlin,Irving/Alexander's_Ragtime_Band|Alexander's Ragtime Band]]", "[[Berlin,Irving/Blue_Skies(Film)|Blue Skies]]", "Easter Parade", "[[Berlin,Irving/Puttin'_on_the_Ritz]]", "[[Berlin,Irving/Cheek_to_Cheek]]", "[[Berlin,Irving/White_Christmas(song)|White Christmas]]", "Happy Holiday", "[[Berlin,Irving/Anything_You_can_do]] (I Can Do Better)", 
> and "[[Berlin,Irving/There's_no_Business_like_Show_Business]]". 
>
> His Broadway musical This Is the Army (1942) was adapted into the 1943 film of the same name.
>
> Berlin's songs have reached the top of the US charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers. 
> 
> Berlin died in 1989 at the age of 101. 
> 
> Composer Douglas Moore sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, 
> and includes him instead with Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman, and Carl Sandburg, 
> as a "great American minstrel"—someone who has "caught and immortalized in his songs 
> what we say, what we think about, and what we believe."  
> 
> Composer George Gershwin called him "the greatest songwriter that has ever lived", 
> and composer Jerome Kern concluded that "Irving Berlin has no place in American music—
> he is American music."
