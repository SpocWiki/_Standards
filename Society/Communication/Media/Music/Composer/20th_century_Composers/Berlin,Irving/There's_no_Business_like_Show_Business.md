> written for the 1946 musical Annie Get Your Gun and orchestrated by Ted Royal. 
>

> of a life in show business, is sung in the musical by members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show 
> in an attempt to persuade Annie Oakley to join the production. 
> It is reprised three times in the musical.
>
> In 1953, Ethel Merman sang the song 
> before a live television audience of 60 million persons, 
> broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks,
