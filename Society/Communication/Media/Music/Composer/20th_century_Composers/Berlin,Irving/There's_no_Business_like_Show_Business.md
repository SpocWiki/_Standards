## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> "**There's No Business Like Show Business**" is an Irving Berlin song, 
> written for the 1946 musical Annie Get Your Gun and orchestrated by Ted Royal. 
> 
> The song, a slightly tongue-in-cheek salute to the glamour and excitement 
> of a life in show business, is sung in the musical by members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show 
> in an attempt to persuade Annie Oakley to join the production. 
> It is reprised three times in the musical.
>
> In 1953, Ethel Merman sang the song 
> before a live television audience of 60 million persons, 
> broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks, 
> as part of The Ford 50th Anniversary Show.
