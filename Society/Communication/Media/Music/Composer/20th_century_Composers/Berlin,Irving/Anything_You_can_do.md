> "Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)" 
> is a show tune composed by Irving Berlin 
> for the 1946 Broadway musical Annie Get Your Gun. 
> The song is a duet, with one male singer and one female singer 
> attempting to outdo each other in increasingly complex tasks.
>
> In the musical, the song sets the scene for the climactic sharpshooting contest 
> between Annie Oakley and Frank Butler. 
> Its most memorable lines are, 
> "Anything you can do, I can do better; I can do anything better than you." 
> The song was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton.
>
> During the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example, 
> sing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, 
> and boast of their abilities and accomplishments, 
> such as opening safes and living on bread and cheese, 
> although Annie almost always seems to counter Frank's argument. 
> Neither can "bake a pie," though.
