> **Karlheinz Stockhausen** (German: [kaʁlˈhaɪnts ˈʃtɔkhaʊzn̩] ; 
> 22 August 1928 – 5 December 2007) 
> was a German composer, widely acknowledged by critics as one of the most important 
> but also controversial composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. 
> 
> He is known for his groundbreaking work in electronic music, 
> having been called the "father of electronic music", 
> for introducing controlled chance (aleatory techniques) into serial composition, and for musical spatialization.
>
> He was educated at the Hochschule für Musik Köln and the University of Cologne, 
> later studying with Olivier Messiaen in Paris and with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn. 
> 
> As one of the leading figures of the Darmstadt School, 
> his compositions and theories were and remain widely influential, 
> not only on composers of art music, but also on jazz and popular music. 
> 
> His works, composed over a period of nearly sixty years, eschew traditional forms. 
> In addition to electronic music—both with and without live performers—
> they range from miniatures for musical boxes through works for solo instruments, 
> songs, chamber music, choral and orchestral music, to a cycle of seven full-length operas. 
> His theoretical and other writings comprise ten large volumes. 
> He received numerous prizes and distinctions for his compositions, recordings, 
> and for the scores produced by his publishing company.
>
> His notable compositions include the series of nineteen Klavierstücke (Piano Pieces), 
> Kontra-Punkte for ten instruments, the electronic/musique-concrète Gesang der Jünglinge, 
> Gruppen for three orchestras, the percussion solo Zyklus, Kontakte, the cantata Momente, 
> the live-electronic Mikrophonie I, Hymnen, Stimmung for six vocalists, Aus den sieben Tagen, 
> Mantra for two pianos and electronics, Tierkreis, Inori for soloists and orchestra, and the gigantic opera cycle Licht.
>
> He died at the age of 79, on 5 December 2007 at his home in Kürten, Germany.
