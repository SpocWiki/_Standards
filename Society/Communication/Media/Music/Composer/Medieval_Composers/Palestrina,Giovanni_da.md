> Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (between 3 February 1525 and 2 February 1526 – 2 February 1594) 
> was an Italian composer of late Renaissance music. 
> The central representative of the Roman School, with Orlande de Lassus and Tomás Luis de Victoria, 
> Palestrina is considered the leading composer of late 16th-century Europe.
>
> Born in the town of Palestrina in the Papal States, Palestrina moved to Rome as a child 
> and underwent musical studies there. 
> In 1551, Pope Julius III appointed him maestro di cappella of the Cappella Giulia at St. Peter's Basilica. 
> He left the post four years later, unable to continue as a layman under the papacy of Paul IV, 
> and held similar positions at St. John Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore in the following decade. 
> Palestrina returned to the Cappella Giulia in 1571 and remained at St Peter's until his death in 1594.
>
> Primarily known for his masses and motets, which number over 105 and 250 respectively, 
> Palestrina had a long-lasting influence on the development of church and secular music in Europe, 
> especially on the development of counterpoint. 
> 
> According to Grove Music Online, Palestrina's "success 
> in reconciling the functional and aesthetic aims of Catholic church music in the post-Tridentine period 
> earned him an enduring reputation as the ideal Catholic composer, 
> as well as giving his style (or, more precisely, later generations' selective view of it) 
> an iconic stature as a model of perfect achievement."
