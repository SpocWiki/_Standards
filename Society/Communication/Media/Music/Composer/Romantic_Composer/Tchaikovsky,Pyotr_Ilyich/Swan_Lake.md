> Swan Lake (Russian: Лебеди́ное о́зеро, romanized: Lebedínoje ózero, Russian: [lʲɪbʲɪˈdʲinəjə ˈozʲɪrə]), 
> Opus 20, is a ballet composed by [[../Tchaikovsky,Pyotr_Ilyich|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] between 1875 and 1876. 
> 
> The original production premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on 4 March 1877 
> (20 February Old Style), with choreography by Julius Reisinger. 
> 
> The ballet, initially conceived in two acts, is based on Russian and German folk tales 
> and tells the story of Princess Odette, who is transformed into a swan by the sorcerer Von Rothbart.
>
> The initial reception was lukewarm, with criticism directed at various elements of the production. 
> Despite this, Swan Lake has become one of the most frequently performed ballets worldwide.
>
> Most modern productions derive their choreography and music from the 1895 revival, 
> which was staged by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on 15 January 1895. 
> This revival was choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. 
> 
> The musical score was revised by Riccardo Drigo, the chief conductor of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre. 
> The 1895 version extended the ballet to four acts and restructured the storyline, 
> establishing a framework that has shaped subsequent stagings.
>
> The ballet’s narrative centers on the relationship between Prince Siegfried 
> and Odette, the Swan Queen, and includes iconic sequences such as the Dance of the Little Swans 
> and the Black Swan pas de deux. 
> 
> Swan Lake’s themes of transformation, love, and redemption 
> are set against Tchaikovsky’s symphonic score, noted for its complexity and emotional depth.
