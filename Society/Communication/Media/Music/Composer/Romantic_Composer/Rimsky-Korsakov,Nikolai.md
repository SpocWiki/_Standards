## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov (18 March 1844 – 21 June 1908) 
> was a Russian composer, a member of the group of composers known as The Five. 
> 
> His best-known orchestral compositions—Capriccio Espagnol, 
> the Russian Easter Festival Overture, and the symphonic suite Scheherazade—
> are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites 
> and excerpts from some of his fifteen operas. 
> Scheherazade is an example of his frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects.
>
> Rimsky-Korsakov believed in developing a nationalistic style of classical music, 
> employing Russian folk song and lore along with exotic harmonic, melodic 
> and rhythmic elements in a practice known as musical orientalism, 
> and eschewing traditional Western compositional methods. 
> 
> Rimsky-Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques 
> after he became a professor of musical composition, harmony, and orchestration 
> at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871. 
> 
> He undertook a rigorous three-year program of self-education 
> and became a master of Western methods, 
> incorporating them alongside the influences of Mikhail Glinka and fellow members of The Five. 
> Rimsky-Korsakov's techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched 
> by his exposure to the works of Richard Wagner.
>
> For much of his life, Rimsky-Korsakov combined his composition and teaching 
> with a career in the Russian armed forces—first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, 
> then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. 
> 
> He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood 
> from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. 
> 
> This love of the sea may have influenced him to write 
> two of his best-known orchestral works, 
> the musical tableau Sadko (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) 
> and Scheherazade. 
> 
> As Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg.
>
> Rimsky-Korsakov left a considerable body of original Russian nationalist compositions. 
> He prepared works by The Five for performance, 
> which brought them into the active classical repertoire 
> (although there is controversy over his editing of the works of Modest Mussorgsky), 
> and shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians 
> during his decades as an educator. 
> 
> Rimsky-Korsakov is therefore considered "the main architect" 
> of what the classical-music public considers the "Russian style". 
> 
> His influence on younger composers was especially important, 
> as he served as a transitional figure 
> between the autodidactism exemplified by Glinka and The Five, 
> and professionally trained composers, who became the norm in Russia 
> by the closing years of the 19th century. 
> 
> While Rimsky-Korsakov's style was based on those of 
> Glinka, Balakirev, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and, for a brief period, Wagner, 
> he "transmitted this style directly to two generations of Russian composers" 
> and influenced non-Russian composers including 
> Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Ottorino Respighi.
