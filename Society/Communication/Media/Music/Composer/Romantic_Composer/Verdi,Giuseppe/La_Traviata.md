> La traviata (Italian: [la traviˈaːta, -aˈvjaː-]; The Fallen Woman) 
> is an [[../../../Music_Genre/Classical_Music/Opera|opera]] in three acts by [[../Verdi,Giuseppe|Giuseppe Verdi]] 
> set to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. 
> 
> It is based on La Dame aux camélias (1852), a play by Alexandre Dumas fils, 
> which he adapted from his own 1848 novel. 
> The opera was originally titled Violetta, after the main character. 
> It was first performed on 6 March 1853 at La Fenice opera house in Venice.
>
> Piave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, 
> but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past, "c. 1700". 
> 
> It was not until the 1880s that the composer's and librettist's original wishes were carried out 
> and "realistic" productions were staged. 
> 
> La traviata has become immensely popular 
> and is among the most frequently performed of all operas.
