> Guillaume Du Fay ( dyoo-FEYE, French: [ɡijom dy fa(j)i]; also Dufay, Du Fayt; 5 August 1397 – 27 November 1474) 
> was a composer and music theorist of early Renaissance music, 
> who is variously described as French or Franco-Flemish. 
> Considered the leading European composer of his time, his music was widely performed and reproduced. 
> Du Fay was well-associated with composers of the Burgundian School, 
> particularly his colleague Gilles Binchois, but was never a regular member of the Burgundian chapel himself.
>
> While he is among the best-documented composers of his time, 
> Du Fay's birth and family is shrouded with uncertainty, though he was probably the illegitimate child of a priest. 
> He was educated at Cambrai Cathedral, where his teachers included Nicolas Grenon and Richard Loqueville. 
> 
> For the next decade, Du Fay worked throughout Europe: as a subdeacon in Cambrai, 
> under Carlo I Malatesta in Rimini, for the House of Malatesta in Pesaro, and under Louis Aleman in Bologna, 
> where he was ordained priest. 
> 
> As his fame began to spread, he settled in Rome in 1428 as musician of the prestigious papal choir, 
> first under Pope Martin V and then Pope Eugene IV, where he wrote the motets Balsamus et munda cera, 
> Ecclesie militantis and Supremum est mortalibus. 
> 
> Amid Rome's financial and political disorder in the 1430s, Du Fay took a leave of absence from the choir 
> to serve Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy. 
>
> Du Fay returned to Italy in 1436, writing his most admired work, the complex motet Nuper Rosarum Flores, 
> which celebrated the consecration of Filippo Brunelleschi's dome for the Florence Cathedral. 
> 
> He later joined the recently moved papal court in Bologna, and was associated with the House of Este in Ferrara. 
> For the next eleven years, Du Fay was in Cambrai serving Philip the Good, 
> under whom he may have written now-lost works on music theory. 
> 
> After a brief return to both Savoy and Italy, Du Fay settled in Cambrai in 1458, 
> where his focus shifted from song and motet, to composing English-inspired cyclic masses based on cantus firmus, 
> such as the Missa Ave regina celorum, the Missa Ecce ancilla Domini, the Missa L'Homme armé 
> and the Missa Se la face ay pale. 
> 
> During his final years in Cambrai, Du Fay wrote his now-lost requiem 
> and both met and influenced the leading musicians of his time, 
> including Antoine Busnois, Loyset Compère, Johannes Tinctoris and particularly, Johannes Ockeghem.
>
> Du Fay has been described as leading the first generation of European musicians 
> who were primarily considered 'composers' by occupation. 
> His erratic career took him throughout Western Europe, forming a 'cosmopolitan style' 
> and an extensive oeuvre which included representatives of virtually every polyphonic genre of his time. 
> Like Binchois, Du Fay was deeply influenced by the contenance angloise style of John Dunstaple, 
> and synthesized it with a wide variety of other styles, including that of the famous Missa Caput, 
> and the techniques of his younger contemporaries, Ockeghem and Busnois.
