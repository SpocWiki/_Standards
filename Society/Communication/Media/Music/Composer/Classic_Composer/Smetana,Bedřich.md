> Bedřich Smetana ( BED-ər-zhikh SMET-ən-ə, Czech: [ˈbɛdr̝ɪx ˈsmɛtana] ; 
> 2 March 1824 – 12 May 1884) was a Czech composer 
> who pioneered the development of a musical style 
> that became closely identified with his people's aspirations to a cultural and political "revival". 
> He has been regarded in his homeland as the father of Czech music. 
> 
> Internationally he is best known for his 1866 opera The Bartered Bride 
> and for the symphonic cycle Má vlast ("My Fatherland"), 
> which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native Bohemia. 
> It contains the famous symphonic poem "Vltava", 
> also popularly known by its German name "Die Moldau" (in English, "The Moldau").
>
> Smetana was naturally gifted as a composer, 
> and gave his first public performance at the age of six. 
> After conventional schooling, he studied music under Josef Proksch in [[../../../../../../Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~Central/Czech_Republic/regions~Czech_Republic/Prague|Prague]]. 
> His first nationalistic music was written during the 1848 Prague uprising, 
> in which he briefly participated. 
> After failing to establish his career in Prague, he left for [[../../../../../../Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~North/Sweden|Sweden]], 
> where he set up as a teacher and choirmaster in Gothenburg, 
> and began to write large-scale orchestral works.
>
> In the early 1860s, a more liberal political climate in Bohemia 
> encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. 
> He threw himself into the musical life of the city, 
> primarily as a champion of the new genre of Czech opera. 
> 
> In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, 
> were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. 
> 
> In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, 
> but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. 
> Factions within the city's musical establishment 
> considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and [[Wagner,Richard|Richard Wagner]] 
> inimical to the development of a distinctively Czech opera style. 
> 
> This opposition interfered with his creative work, 
> and may have hastened a decline in health 
> that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.
>
> By the end of 1874, Smetana had become completely deaf 
> but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, 
> he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost the rest of his life. 
> 
> His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, 
> but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. 
> 
> His reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, 
> where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. 
> 
> However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, 
> and most foreign commentators 
> tend to regard [[../Romantic_Composer/Dvořák,Antonín|Antonín Dvořák]] as a more significant Czech composer.
