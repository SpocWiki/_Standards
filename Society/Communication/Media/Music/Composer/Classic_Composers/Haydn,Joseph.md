> Haydn arose from humble origins and established his career first by serving as a chorister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, then through an arduous period as a freelance musician. He eventually found success and spent much of his working life as music director for the wealthy Esterházy family at their palace in rural Hungary. Though he had his own orchestra there, it isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, "forced to become original". During this period his music circulated widely in publication, cementing his position as Europe's leading composer. With the death of his primary patron Nikolaus Esterházy in 1790, Haydn was free to travel, and augmented his fame—now as a performer before the public—in both London and Vienna. The last years of his life were spent in a state of debility, unable to compose due to declining health. He died in Vienna in 1809 at the age of 77.

> Haydn was a friend and mentor of Mozart, a teacher of Beethoven, and the elder brother of composer Michael Haydn.
