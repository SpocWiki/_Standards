## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **An American in Paris** is a jazz-influenced symphonic poem (or tone poem) for orchestra 
> by American composer George Gershwin first performed in 1928. 
> It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in Paris 
> and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the Années folles.
>
> Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra 
> plus celesta, saxophones, and automobile horns. 
> 
> He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, 
> which took place on December 13, 1928, in Carnegie Hall, 
> with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic. 
> 
> It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his Concerto in F 
> following the earlier success of Rhapsody in Blue (1924). 
> He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere. 
> He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer Deems Taylor.
>
> On January 1, 2025, An American in Paris entered the public domain.
