> In Western music theory, a **Chord** is a group of notes 
> played together for their harmonic consonance or dissonance. 
> 
> The most basic type of chord is a triad, so called because it consists of three distinct notes: 
> the root note along with intervals of a third and a fifth above the root note. 
> Chords with more than three notes include added tone chords, extended chords and tone clusters, 
> which are used in contemporary classical music, jazz, and other genres.
>
> Chords are the building blocks of harmony and form the harmonic foundation of a piece of music. 
> They provide the harmonic support and coloration that accompany melodies 
> and contribute to the overall sound and mood of a musical composition. 
> The factors, or component notes, of a chord are often sounded simultaneously 
> but can instead be sounded consecutively, as in an arpeggio.
>
> A succession of chords is called a chord progression. 
> One example of a widely used chord progression in Western traditional music and blues 
> is the 12 bar blues progression. 
> 
> Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, 
> certain patterns of chords are more common in Western music, 
> and some patterns have been accepted 
> as establishing the key (tonic note) in common-practice harmony—
> notably the resolution of a dominant chord to a tonic chord. 
> To describe this, Western music theory has developed 
> the practice of numbering chords using Roman numerals 
> to represent the number of diatonic steps up from the tonic note of the scale.
>
> Common ways of notating or representing chords in Western music 
> (other than conventional staff notation) include Roman numerals, the Nashville Number System, 
> figured bass, chord letters (sometimes used in modern musicology), and chord charts.
