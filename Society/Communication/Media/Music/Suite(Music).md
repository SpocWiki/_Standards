> A **Suite**, in Western classical music, 
> is an ordered set of instrumental or orchestral/concert band pieces. 
> 
> It originated in the late 14th century as a pairing of dance tunes; 
> and grew in scope so that by the early 17th century it comprised up to five dances, 
> sometimes with a prelude. 
> 
> The separate movements were often thematically and tonally linked. 
> The term can also be used to refer to similar forms in other musical traditions, 
> such as the Turkish fasıl and the Arab nuubaat.
>
> In the Baroque era, the suite was an important musical form, also known as Suite de danses, Ordre (the term favored by François Couperin), Partita, or Ouverture (after the theatrical "overture" which often included a series of dances) as with the orchestral suites of Christoph Graupner, Telemann and J.S. Bach.
>
> During the 18th century, the suite fell out of favour as a cyclical form, giving way to the symphony, sonata and concerto. It was revived in the later 19th century, but in a different form, often presenting extracts from a ballet (Nutcracker Suite), the incidental music to a play (L'Arlésienne, Masquerade), opera, film (Lieutenant Kije Suite) or video game (Motoaki Takenouchi's 1994 suite to the Shining series), or entirely original movements (Holberg Suite, The Planets).
