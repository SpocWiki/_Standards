> James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) 
> was an American singer-songwriter and musician. 
> 
> He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. 
> Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a part of his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, 
> the institution describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".
>
> Hendrix began playing guitar at age 15. 
> In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. 
> Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, then Nashville, Tennessee, 
> and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band 
> and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. 
> He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires.
>
> Hendrix moved to England in late 1966, 
> after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. 
> Within months, he had formed his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience 
> (with its rhythm section consisting of bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell), 
> and achieved three UK top ten hits: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". 
> 
> He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. 
> His third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland (1968), 
> became his most commercially successful release 
> and his only number one album on the US Billboard 200 chart. 
> 
> The world's highest-paid rock musician, Hendrix headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 
> and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970.  
> He died in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia in September 1970, at the age of 27.
>
> Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. 
> He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, 
> and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds 
> caused by guitar amplifier feedback. 
> 
> He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units 
> in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. 
> 
> He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. 
> Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: 
> "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. 
> Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, 
> but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary 
> every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."
