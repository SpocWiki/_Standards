> Charles Edward Anderson Berry (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) 
> was an American singer, guitarist and songwriter who pioneered rock and roll. 
> 
> Nicknamed the "Father of Rock and Roll", he refined and developed rhythm and blues 
> into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive 
> with songs such as "Maybellene" (1955), "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956), "Rock and Roll Music" (1957), 
> and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958). 
> 
> Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, 
> and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, 
> Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.
>
> Born into a middle-class black family in St. Louis, Berry had an interest in music from an early age 
> and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. 
> 
> While still a high school student, he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, 
> where he was held from 1944 to 1947. 
> After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. 
> Influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, 
> By early 1953 Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. 
> His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, 
> who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. 
> With Chess, he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—
> which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart.
>
> By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, 
> with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. 
> 
> He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. 
> He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act—
> he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sex. 
> 
> After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including "No Particular Place to Go", "You Never Can Tell", and "Nadine". 
> 
> However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, 
> and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, 
> playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. 
> In 1972, he reached a new level of achievement 
> when a rendition of "My Ding-a-Ling" became his only record to top the charts.
>
> Berry was among the first musicians to be 
> inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; 
> he was cited for having "laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance." 
> 
> Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazine's "greatest of all time" lists; 
> he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time 
> and 2nd greatest guitarist of all time in 2023. 
> 
> The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll 
> includes three of Berry's: "Johnny B. Goode", "Maybellene", and "Rock and Roll Music". 
> "Johnny B. Goode" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.
