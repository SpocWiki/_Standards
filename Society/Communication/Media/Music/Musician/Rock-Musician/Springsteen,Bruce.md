> 
> All seven singles from Born in the U.S.A. reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, 
> including the title track. 
>

> Tunnel of Love (1987), Human Touch (1992), and Lucky Town (1992). 
> He reassembled the E Street Band for Greatest Hits (1995), 
> and recorded the acoustic album The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995) and the EP Blood Brothers (1996) solo.
>
> Springsteen then released The Rising (2002), 
> which was dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks.
