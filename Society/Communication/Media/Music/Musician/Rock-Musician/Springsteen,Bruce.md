>
> Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. 
> and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, in 1973.

> and The River (1980), Springsteen's first album to top the Billboard 200 chart. 
> After the solo acoustic album Nebraska (1982), he recorded Born in the U.S.A. (1984) 
> with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album 
> and the 23rd-best selling album of all time as of 2024. 
> 
> All seven singles from Born in the U.S.A. reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, 
> including the title track. 
> 
> Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, 
> Tunnel of Love (1987), Human Touch (1992), and Lucky Town (1992). 
> He reassembled the E Street Band for Greatest Hits (1995), 
> and recorded the acoustic album The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995) and the EP Blood Brothers (1996) solo.
>
> Springsteen then released The Rising (2002), 
> which was dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. 
> He released two more folk albums, Devils & Dust (2005) 
> and We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006), his first cover album. 
> 
> Springsteen followed with two more albums with the E Street Band, 
> Magic (2007) and Working on a Dream (2009). 
> 
> His next albums, Wrecking Ball (2012) and High Hopes (2014), topped album charts worldwide. 
> In 2017, 2018 and 2021, Springsteen performed the critically acclaimed show Springsteen on Broadway, in which he performed songs and told stories from his 2016 autobiography; 
> an album version from the Broadway performances was released in 2018. 
> He released the solo album Western Stars in 2019, Letter to You with the E Street Band in 2020, 
> and a solo covers album entitled Only the Strong Survive in 2022.

> making Springsteen the first artist to release a top-five album in six consecutive decades.
>
> A prominent musician from the album era, 
> Springsteen has sold more 140 million records worldwide, 
> making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

> 
> In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked Springsteen 23rd on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", 
> describing him as "the embodiment of rock and roll".
