Despite faltering critical responses, his next four albums—The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), Jesus Is King (2019), and Donda (2021)—continued his series of consecutive number one debuts on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, West also released the collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z, Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi, and the Vultures (2024) duology with Ty Dolla Sign.
