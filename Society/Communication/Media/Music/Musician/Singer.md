> Singing is the art of creating music with the voice. 
> It is the oldest form of musical expression, 
> and the human voice can be considered the first musical instrument. 
>
> The definition of singing varies across sources. 
> Some sources define singing as the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. 
> Other common definitions include "the utterance of words or sounds in tuneful succession" 
> or "the production of musical tones by means of the human voice".
>
> A person whose profession is singing is called a **Singer** 
> or a vocalist (in jazz or popular music). 
> Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) 
> that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. 
> Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a [[Choir]].  
> Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument 
> (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. 
> Many styles of singing exist throughout the world.
>
> Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. 
> It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, 
> comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a profession. 
>
> Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. 
> If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. 
> Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, 
> such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success 
> (singing in more than one genre). 
> Professional singers typically receive voice training from vocal coaches or voice teachers 
> throughout their careers.
>
> Singing should not be confused with rapping as they are not the same. 
> According to music scholar and rap historian Martin E. Connor, 
> "Rap is often defined by its very opposition to singing." 
> While also a form of vocal music, rap differs from singing in that 
> it does not engage with tonality in the same way and does not require pitch accuracy. 
> Like singing, rap does use rhythm in connection to words 
> but these are spoken rather than sung on specific pitches. 
> Grove Music Online states that 
> "Within the historical context of popular music in the United States, 
> rap can be seen as an alternative to singing 
> that could connect directly with stylistic speech practices in African American English." 
> However, some rap artists do employ singing as well as rapping in their music; 
> using the switch between the rhythmic speech of rapping 
> and the sung pitches of singing as a striking contrast to grab the attention of the listener.
