## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. 
> Referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll", 
> he is widely regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. 
> Presley's sexually provocative performance style, 
> combined with a mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, 
> brought both great success and initial controversy. 
>
> Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13. 
> He began his music career in 1954 at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, 
> who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. 
> Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, 
> was a pioneer of rockabilly, 
> an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. 
> 
> In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet 
> and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, 
> who managed him for the rest of his career. 
> 
> Presley's first RCA Victor single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 
> and became a number-one hit in the US. 
> Within a year, RCA Victor sold ten million Presley singles. 
> With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, 
> Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; 
> though his performing style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans 
> led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.
>
> In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. 
> Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later 
> with some of his most commercially successful work. 
> 
> Presley held few concerts, and, guided by Parker, devoted much of the 1960s 
> to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. 
> Some of Presley's most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), 
> and Viva Las Vegas (1964). 
> 
> In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special Elvis, 
> which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and several highly profitable tours. 
> In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, 
> Aloha from Hawaii. 
> 
> Years of substance abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, 
> and Presley died in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.
>
> Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, 
> having sold an estimated 500 million records worldwide. 
> 
> He was commercially successful in many genres, including 
> pop, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. 
> 
> Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, 
> and has been posthumously inducted into multiple music halls of fame. 
> 
> He holds several records, including 
> - most Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified gold and platinum albums, 
> - most albums charted on the Billboard 200, 
> - most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and 
> - most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. 
> 
> In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
