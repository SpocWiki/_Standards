> Hiram "Hank" Williams (September 17, 1923 – January 1, 1953) 
> was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. 
> 
> An early pioneer of country music, he is regarded as one of the 
> most significant and influential musicians of the 20th century. 
> Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 
> of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, 
> five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.
>
> Born and raised in Alabama, 
> Williams learned guitar from African-American blues musician Rufus Payne. 
> Both Payne and Roy Acuff significantly influenced his musical style. 
> 
> After winning an amateur talent contest, 
> Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s 
> playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as 
> school houses, movie theaters, and bars. 
> 
> He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, 
> and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. 
> Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, 
> he was fired and rehired several times by radio station WSFA, 
> and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.
>
> In 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard, 
> who competed with his mother to control his career. 
> 
> After recording "Never Again" and "Honky Tonkin'" with Sterling Records, 
> he signed a contract with MGM Records. 
> 
> He released the hit single "Move It On Over" in 1947 
> and joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. 
> 
> The next year he released a cover of "Lovesick Blues", 
> which quickly reached number one on Billboard's Top Country & Western singles chart 
> and propelled him to stardom on the Grand Ole Opry. 
> Although unable to read or notate music to any significant degree, 
> he wrote such iconic hits as "Your Cheatin' Heart", "Hey, Good Lookin'", 
> and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry". 
> During his final years, he struggled with back pain and substance abuse, 
> exacerbating his relationships with Audrey and the Grand Ole Opry.
>
> Williams died on New Year's Day 1953 at the age of 29, 
> his heart failing in the back seat of a car near Oak Hill, West Virginia, 
> en route to a concert in Canton, Ohio. 
> 
> Despite his relatively brief career, 
> he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, 
> especially in country music. 
> 
> Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, 
> Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, among others. 
> 
> He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, 
> the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, 
> the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 1999, 
> and gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
> 
> In 2010, he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his "craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life." His life and career were dramatized in the 2016 biopic I Saw the Light.
