Appeared first during the Soccer WM 1990 in [[../../../../../../../_Standards/Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~South/Italy|Italy]]. 

[[Three_Tenors/Pavarotti,Luciano]] and [[Three_Tenors/Domingo,Placido]] were competing 
and Pavarotti tended to dominate the group, also with his Body Mass. 

[[Three_Tenors/Carreras,José]] was liked by both, 
especially because he was diagnosed with Leukemia Cancer at the age of 40
and had just recovered the year before. 

4 years later during the Soccer WM 1994 in [[Los_Angeles]] this was repeated, 
with a more American Repertoire  like [[I_did_it_my_way]], [[I_want_to_be_in_America]],
