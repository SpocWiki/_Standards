## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. 
> Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, 
> they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experiments, 
> philosophical lyrics, and elaborate live performances, 
> and became a leading progressive rock band.
>
> Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by 
> - Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), 
> - Nick Mason (drums), 
> - Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and 
> - Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). 
> 
> With Barrett as their main songwriter, they released two hit singles, 
> "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", 
> and the successful debut studio album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (all 1967). 
> 
> David Gilmour (guitar, vocals) joined in 1967; 
> Barrett left in 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. 
> All four remaining members contributed compositions, 
> though Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, 
> devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful studio albums, 
> - The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), 
> - Wish You Were Here (1975), 
> - Animals (1977) and 
> - The Wall (1979). 
> 
> The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd â€“ The Wall (1982), won two BAFTAs. 
> Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.
>
> Personal tensions led to Wright leaving the band in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. 
> Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. 
> 
> They produced the studio albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) 
> and The Division Bell (1994), both backed by major tours. 
> 
> In 2005, Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited with Waters 
> for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. 
> 
> Barrett died in 2006, as did Wright in 2008. 
> The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), 
> was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. 
> In 2022, Pink Floyd released the song "Hey, Hey, Rise Up!" 
> in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
>
> By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, 
> making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. 
> 
> The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, 
> and are among the best-selling albums of all time. 
> 
> Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200 and five topped the UK Albums Chart. 
> 
> Although an album-orientated band, they did achieve several hit singles, including 
> "Arnold Layne", "See Emily Play" (both 1967), "Money" (1973), "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (1979), "Not Now John" (1983), "On the Turning Away" (1987) and "High Hopes" (1994). 
> 
> Pink Floyd were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 
> and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. 
> 
> In 2008, they were awarded the Polar Music Prize for "their monumental contribution 
> over the decades to the fusion of art and music in the development of popular culture".
