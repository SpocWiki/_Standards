## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Foo Fighters** is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. 
> Founded as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer [[Foo_Fighters/Grohl,Dave]], 
> the lineup now consists of Grohl (lead vocals, guitar), Nate Mendel (bass), Chris Shiflett 
> and Pat Smear (guitars), Rami Jaffee (keyboards), and Josh Freese (drums). 
> Drummers William Goldsmith and [[Taylor Hawkins]], along with guitarist Franz Stahl, are former members of the band.
>
> Grohl created Foo Fighters after the breakup of Nirvana in 1994 to release solo material. 
> Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 eponymous debut album, 
> he recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, 
> who had played with Nirvana on tour. 
> 
> The band made their first public performance in February 1995. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, 
> The Colour and the Shape (1997). Most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward.
>
> Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Stahl and Hawkins. 
> Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). 
> The band briefly continued as a trio until Shiflett joined after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose, 
> solidifying the core of their lineup. 
> Foo Fighters released their fourth album, One by One, in 2002. 
> It was followed with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), 
> which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. 
> Foo Fighters released their sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007.
>
> For Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, Wasting Light (2011), produced by Butch Vig, 
> Smear returned as a full member, after having appeared frequently with the band since 2005. 
> Sonic Highways (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. 
> Concrete and Gold (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States 
> and the first to feature Jaffee, their longtime session and touring keyboardist, as a full member. 
> Their tenth album, Medicine at Midnight (2021), was the last before Hawkins' death in March 2022. 
> Freese was announced as the band's new drummer the following year. 
> Their eleventh album, But Here We Are, was released in June 2023.
>
> Foo Fighters have won 15 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album five times, 
> making them among the most successful rock acts in Grammy history. In 2021, 
> the band was announced as recipients of the first "Global Icon" award at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. 
> They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, their first year of eligibility.
