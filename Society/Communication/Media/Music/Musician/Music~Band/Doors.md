## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, comprising 
> - vocalist Jim Morrison, 
> - keyboardist Ray Manzarek, 
> - guitarist Robby Krieger, and 
> - drummer John Densmore. 
> 
> They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, 
> primarily due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. 
> The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.
>
> The band took its name from the title of the English writer Aldous Huxley's book 
> The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a quote by the English poet William Blake. 
> 
> After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison 
> recorded and released six studio albums in five years, 
> some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their debut 
> - The Doors (1967), 
> - Strange Days (1967), 
> - Morrison Hotel (1970), and 
> - L.A. Woman (1971). 
> 
> Dubbed the "Kings of Acid Rock" by Life, 
> they were one of the most successful bands of their time 
> and by 1972, the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.
>
> Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. 
> The band continued as a trio, releasing two more albums until disbanding in 1973. 
> In 1978, they reformed for the album An American Prayer, 
> which combined new music with Morrison's recitings of his poetry recorded in 1969 and 1970. 
> 
> They reunited again briefly in 1993 when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
> and for several one-off projects in the 21st century. 
> 
> In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals 
> started performing as "The Doors of the 21st Century". 
> Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. 
> After a short time as Riders on the Storm, 
> they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.
>
> The Doors were the first American band to accumulate 
> eight consecutive Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) Gold and Platinum LPs. 
> According to the RIAA, they have sold 36 million albums in the United States 
> and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. 
> 
> The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including 
> Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".
