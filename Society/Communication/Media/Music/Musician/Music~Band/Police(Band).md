> **The Police** were an English rock band formed in London in 1977. 
> Within a few months of their first gig, the line-up settled as 
> - Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), 
> - Andy Summers (guitar) and 
> - Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion), 
> and remained unchanged for the rest of the band's history. 
> The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and early to mid 1980s. 
> Emerging in the British new wave scene, 
> they played a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz.
>
> Their 1978 debut album, [[Outlandos d'Amour]], reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart 
> on the strength of the singles "[[Roxanne,Police-song]]" and "[[Can't Stand Losing You]]". 
> Their second album, [[Reggatta de Blanc]] (1979), became 
> the first of four consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the UK and Australia; 
> its first two singles, "[[Message in a Bottle]]" and "[[Walking on the Moon]]", 
> became their first UK number ones. 
> Their next two albums, [[Zenyatta Mondatta]] (1980) and [[Ghost in the Machine]] (1981), 
> led to further critical and commercial success with two songs, 
> "[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]" and "[[Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic]]", 
> becoming UK number-one singles and Top 5 hits in other countries; 
> the former album was their breakthrough into the US 
> reaching number five on the US Billboard 200.
>
> Their final studio album, [[Synchronicity]] (1983), 
> was No. 1 in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and the US, 
> selling over 8 million copies in the US. 
> 
> Its lead single, "[[Every Breath You Take]]", became their fifth UK number one, 
> and only US number one. 
> 
> During this time, the band were considered 
> one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the US; in 1983 
> Rolling Stone labelled them "the first British New Wave act 
> to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world". 
> The Police disbanded in 1986, 
> periodically reuniting for one-off performances 
> before fully reuniting in early 2007 for a world tour that ended in August 2008. 
> They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, due to their reunion tour, 
> which was the highest-grossing tour of 2007.
>
> The Police have sold over 75 million records, 
> making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. 
> The band won a number of music awards, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards—
> winning Best British Group once, and an MTV Video Music Award. 
> 
> In 2003, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
> Four of their five studio albums appeared on Rolling Stone's 
> list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". 
> 
> The band were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's 
> lists of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".
