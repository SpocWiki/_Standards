> AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. 
> Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock and heavy metal, 
> although the band calls it simply "rock and roll". 
> 
> They are cited as a formative influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands. 
> The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.
>
> AC/DC were founded in 1973 by brothers Angus (lead guitar) and Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), 
> with Colin Burgess (drums), Larry Van Kriedt (bass guitar) and Dave Evans (lead vocals). 
> 
> They underwent several line-up changes before releasing their debut Australasian-only album, [[High_Voltage(1975)]]. 
> Membership stabilised after the release of Let There Be Rock (1977), 
> with the Young brothers, Phil Rudd on drums, Cliff Williams on bass guitar 
> and Bon Scott on lead vocals. 
> 
> Seven months after the release of [[Highway_to_Hell(1979)]], Scott died of alcohol poisoning 
> and English singer Brian Johnson was then recruited as their new frontman. 
> 
> Their first album with Johnson, [[../../../../../../../_private/Society/Communication/Media/Music.internal/Music~Album/AC-DC~Back_in_Black|AC-DC~Back_in_Black]](1980), dedicated to Scott's memory, 
> became the second best-selling album of all time. 
> The eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock (1981), 
> was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. 
> 
> Rudd was fired partway through the Flick of the Switch sessions in 1983 
> and was replaced by Simon Wright, who was replaced by Chris Slade six years later.
>
> AC/DC experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of album The Razors Edge (1990); 
> it was their only record to feature Slade, as Rudd returned in 1994. 
> Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with Ballbreaker (1995). 
> 
> Their fifteenth studio album, Black Ice, was the second highest-selling record of 2008 
> and their highest chart peak since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching number one worldwide. 
> 
> The band's line-up remained the same for 20 years until 2014 when Malcolm retired due to early-onset dementia, 
> from which he died three years later; 
> additionally, Rudd was charged with threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis. 
> 
> Angus and Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young, replaced Malcolm and debuted on the album Rock or Bust (2014). 
> On the accompanying tour, Slade filled in for Rudd. 
> 
> In 2016, Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose replaced Johnson for the rest of the tour dates due to a risk of hearing loss, 
> Williams retired at the end of the tour and the band entered a two-year hiatus. 
> 
> A reunion of the Rock or Bust line-up was announced in September 2020; 
> the band's seventeenth studio album, Power Up, was released two months later. 
> Their supporting tour was announced in February 2024, 
> with drummer Matt Laug replacing Rudd, and bass guitarist Chris Chaney replacing Williams.
