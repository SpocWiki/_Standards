Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong


Tonight 
I throw myself in two
Out of the red
Out of her head she sang
(
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
du du  du du  
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
)

Come down 
and waste away with me
Down with me

Slow, how 
you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say you win
She sang (
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
du du  du du  
du du  du du  du du  dubidu
)

  
Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
  
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say you win
She sang (

)
  
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say you win
