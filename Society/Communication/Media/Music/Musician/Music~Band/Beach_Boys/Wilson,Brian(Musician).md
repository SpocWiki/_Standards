> Brian Douglas Wilson (June 20, 1942 – June 11, 2025) 
> was an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer 
> who co-founded  the Beach Boys and received widespread recognition as one 
> of the most innovative and significant musical figures of his era. 
> 
> His work was distinguished for its high production values, complex harmonies and orchestrations, 
> vocal layering, and introspective or ingenuous themes. 
> 
> He was also known for his versatile head voice and falsetto.
>
> Wilson's formative influences included George Gershwin, the Four Freshmen, Phil Spector, and Burt Bacharach. 
> In 1961, he began his professional career as a member of the Beach Boys, serving as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, he became the first pop musician credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He also produced acts such as the Honeys and American Spring. By the mid-1960s he had written or co-written more than two dozen U.S. Top 40 hits, including the number-ones "Surf City" (1963), "I Get Around" (1964), "Help Me, Rhonda" (1965), and "Good Vibrations" (1966). He is considered the first rock producer to apply the studio as an instrument and one of the first music producer auteurs.
>
> Facing lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson had a nervous breakdown in late 1964 and subsequently withdrew from regular concert touring to focus on songwriting and production. This resulted in works of greater sophistication, such as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and his first credited solo release, "Caroline, No" (both 1966), as well as the unfinished album Smile. Branded a genius, by the late 1960s, his productivity and mental health had significantly declined, leading to periods marked by reclusion, overeating, and substance abuse. His first professional comeback yielded the almost solo effort The Beach Boys Love You (1977). In the 1980s, he formed a controversial creative and business partnership with his psychologist, Eugene Landy, and relaunched his solo career with the album **Brian Wilson** (1988). Wilson dissociated from Landy in 1991 and toured regularly from 1999 to 2022. He completed a version of Smile in 2004, earning him his greatest acclaim as a solo artist.
>
> Heralding popular music's recognition as an art form, Wilson's accomplishments as a producer and composer helped initiate an era of unprecedented creative autonomy for label-signed acts. He contributed to the development of many music genres and movements, including the California sound, art pop, psychedelia, chamber pop, progressive music, punk, outsider, and sunshine pop. Since the 1980s, his influence has extended to styles such as post-punk, indie rock, emo, dream pop, Shibuya-kei, and chillwave. He received numerous industry awards, including two Grammy Awards and Kennedy Center Honors, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2000. His life was dramatized in the 2014 biopic Love and Mercy. He died in 2025 of respiratory arrest.
