# [[Abbey_Road(Beatles)]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Abbey Road is the 11th studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, 
> released on 26 September 1969, by Apple Records. 
> 
> It is the last album the group recorded, although Let It Be (1970) 
> was the last album completed before the band's break-up in April 1970. 
> 
> It was mostly recorded in April, July, and August 1969, 
> and topped the record charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom. 
> A double A-side single from the album, "Something" / "Come Together", 
> was released in October, which also topped the charts in the US.
>
> Abbey Road incorporates styles such as rock, pop, blues, and progressive rock, 
> and makes prominent use of the Moog synthesiser and guitar played through a Leslie speaker. 
> It is also notable for having a long medley of songs on side two 
> that have subsequently been covered as one suite by other notable artists. 
> 
> The album was recorded in a more collegial atmosphere than the Get Back / Let It Be sessions earlier in the year, but there were still significant confrontations within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney's song "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", and John Lennon did not perform on several tracks. By the time the album was released, Lennon had left the group, though this was not publicly announced until McCartney also quit the following year.
>
> Although Abbey Road was an instant commercial success, it received mixed reviews upon release. Some critics found its music inauthentic and criticised perceived artificial elements of the production. Critical reception improved in the following years and the album is now widely regarded as one of the Beatles' best and one of the greatest albums of all time. George Harrison's two songs on the album, "Something" and "Here Comes the Sun", are considered among the best he wrote for the group. The album's cover, featuring the Beatles walking across the zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios (then officially named EMI Studios), is one of the most famous and imitated in music history.

The Beatles’ grand exit is also the ultimate entry point into their universe.

Giles Martin, son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin, 
once told that _Abbey Road_ is the perfect gateway into the Beatles universe, 
because it sounds so contemporary. And it’s true: 
While other Beatles albums conjure a specific moment frozen in amber—
the matching suits and mop-tops 
or the mid-period mischievous experimentation with pop form 
or the technicolor burst into psychedelia—
_Abbey Road_ sounds like nothing more or less than four extremely gifted humans 
playing one indelible song after another in the same room together.

“We hardly ever sat down and had nothing. There was always some sort of idea.”
Paul McCartney,The Beatles

The 11th and penultimate album in The Beatles’ historic catalog 
was the last on which all four members worked in the studio as a unit, all at the same time. 
And while singling out one album as their most impactful is a fool’s errand, 
1969’s _Abbey Road_ is indeed the most ageless, 
simply an immaculate, unmatched collection of songs 
by a world-changing band at their creative peak.

Following the sprawl of 1968’s White Album, 
_Abbey Road_ is a relatively concise representation of The Beatles’ entire deal: 
wholesome (“Here Comes the Sun”), a little freaky (“Come Together,” “Polythene Pam”), 
macabre _and_ wholesome (“Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”), 
first-wedding-dance romantic (“Something”), 
whimsical (“Octopus’s Garden,” “Mean Mr. Mustard”), 
and, with its album-closing eight-song, 16-minute medley, playful with form. 

The embers of pop music’s most dynamic collaborative force were dying out, 
but not before yielding one final and definitive document 
of unmatched creativity and camaraderie.
