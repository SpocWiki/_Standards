#has_/time_/started :: 1951-04-27 

> Paul Daniel "Ace" Frehley (; born 1951-04-27) is an American musician 
> who was the original lead guitarist, occasional lead vocalist 
> and founding member of the rock band Kiss. 
> 
> He invented the persona of The Spaceman (a.k.a. Space Ace) 
> and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. 
> 
> After leaving Kiss, Frehley formed his own band named Frehley's Comet 
> and released two albums with the group. 
> He subsequently embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold 
> when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour.
>
> Frehley's second tenure with Kiss lasted until 2002, when he left at the conclusion 
> of what was originally purported to be the band's farewell tour. 
> 
> His most recent solo album, 10,000 Volts, was released on 2024-02-23. 
> Guitar World magazine ranked him as the 14th Greatest Metal Guitarist of All Time.
>
> Outside Kiss, Frehley achieved further commercial success and popularity, 
> with his debut solo album achieving platinum status. 
> His first album with his Frehley's Comet band was also a big success. 
> 
> Frehley is noted for his aggressive, atmospheric and melodic guitar playing 
> and is also known for the use of many "special effects" guitars, 
> including a Gibson Les Paul guitar that emits smoke from the neck humbucker pickup 
> and produces spinning pyrotechnics 
> and a custom Les Paul that emits light based on song tempo. 
> Frehley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of Kiss.
