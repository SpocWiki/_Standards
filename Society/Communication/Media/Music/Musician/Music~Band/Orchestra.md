> An **Orchestra** (OR-ki-strə) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, 
> which combines instruments from different families. 
> 
> There are typically four main sections of instruments:
> - The string section, including the violin, viola, cello, and double bass
> - The woodwind section, including the flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and occasional saxophone
> - The brass section, including the French horn (commonly known as the "horn"), 
>   trumpet, trombone, cornet, and tuba, and sometimes euphonium
> - The percussion section, including the timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, 
>   triangle, tambourine, tam-tam and mallet percussion instruments
>
> Other instruments such as the piano, harpsichord, pipe organ, and celesta 
> may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone as soloist instruments, 
> as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, 
> electronic instruments, and guitars.
>
> A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a symphony orchestra or philharmonic orchestra 
> (from Greek phil-, "loving", and "harmony"). 
> 
> The number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred, 
> depending on the work being played and the venue size. 
> 
> A chamber orchestra (sometimes a concert orchestra) is a smaller ensemble 
> of not more than around fifty musicians. 
> 
> Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, 
> Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, 
> or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, 
> tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire 
> such as the symphonies of  Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. 
> 
> The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, 
> reaching a peak with the large orchestras of as many as 120 players 
> called for in the works of Richard Wagner and later Gustav Mahler.
>
> Orchestras are usually led by a conductor 
> who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, 
> often made easier for the musicians to see by using a short wooden rod known as a conductor's baton. 
> 
> The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo, and shapes the sound of the ensemble. 
> The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, 
> in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.
>
> The leader of the first violin section – commonly called the concertmaster – 
> also plays an important role in leading the musicians. 
> In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster, 
> or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, 
> a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century early music ensembles continue.
>
> Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, 
> concertos for solo instruments, and pit ensembles for operas, ballets, 
> and some types of musical theatre (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas).
>
> Amateur orchestras include 
> youth orchestras made up of students from an elementary school, a high school, or a university, 
> and community orchestras; typically they are made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.
>
> The term orchestra derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα (orchestra), 
> the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.
