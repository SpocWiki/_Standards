> The Cranberries were an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989. 
> The band was composed of lead singer and guitarist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan (Noel's brother), and drummer Fergal Lawler.  O'Riordan replaced founding member Niall Quinn in 1990. The band,  originally named The Cranberry Saw Us, was renamed after the addition of O'Riordan. The band classified themselves as an alternative rock group, but they incorporated into their sound elements of indie rock, jangle pop, dream pop, folk rock, post-punk, and pop rock.
>
> In 1991, the Cranberries signed with Island Records.   They released their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? (1993), to commercial success. Their second album, No Need to Argue (1994), brought the band to international fame and included the single "Zombie,"  which became a stadium anthem and one of the band's most recognizable songs. The band continued this success with the albums To the Faithful Departed (1996) and Bury the Hatchet (1999). 
>
> They transferred to MCA Records in 2000. Their fifth album, Wake Up and Smell the Coffee (2001), did not meet the commercial success of their preceding albums, and the band cited their dissatisfaction with MCA's promotion.
>
> Following a six-year hiatus from 2003 to 2009, the Cranberries embarked on a North American tour that was followed by shows in Latin America and Europe. They released their sixth album, Roses (2012), their first album in eleven years since Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. They expanded their musical style with their seventh acoustic album, Something Else (2017). Following O'Riordan's death from drowning due to alcohol intoxication in 2018, Noel Hogan confirmed that the remaining members chose to disband out of respect for her. They disbanded after the release of their acclaimed final album, In the End (2019).
>
> The Cranberries were one of the best-selling alternative acts of the 1990s, having sold nearly 50 million albums worldwide as of 2019. They won an Ivor Novello Award, a Juno Award, an MTV Europe Music Award, and a World Music Award.  They were nominated for a Brit Award and a Grammy Award. The music video for "Zombie" is the first by an Irish band to reach one billion views on YouTube.
