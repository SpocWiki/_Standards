> Tangerine Dream is a German electronic music band founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. 
> The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, 
> with Froese the only constant member until his death in January 2015. 
> The best-known lineup of the group was its mid-1970s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. 
> In 1979, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann until his own departure in 1985. 
> This lineup was notable for composing many movie soundtracks. 
> Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning. 
> Quaeschning is Froese's chosen successor and is currently the longest-serving band member, 
> having joined in 2005. 
> Quaeschning is currently joined by violinist Hoshiko Yamane who joined in 2011 
> and Paul Frick who joined in 2020. 
> Prior to this Quaeschning and Yamane performed with Ulrich Schnauss from 2014 to 2020. 
> Schnauss only played two shows with Froese in November 2014 before Froese's passing.
>
> Tangerine Dream are considered a pioneering act in electronica. 
> Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role 
> in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische Musik ("cosmic music"). 
> 
> Their "Virgin Years", so called because of their association with Virgin Records, 
> produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, 
> including the UK top 20 albums Phaedra (1974) and Rubycon (1975). 
> The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores.
>
> From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of instrumental music 
> as well as electronica. 
> Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. 
> Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. 
> Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles 
> such as new-age and electronic dance music.
>
> On 29 September 2017, the band released an all-new music studio album entitled Quantum Gate. 
> In December 2019, they released Recurring Dreams, 
> a compilation of new recordings of some of the band's classic compositions. 
> 
> On 26 November 2021, the band released an EP entitled Probe 6–8 
> (including three tracks: "Raum", "Para Guy" and "Continuum"), 
> whose concept was developed further on their following album Raum, 
> their latest studio album to date which was released on 25 February 2022.
