> Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. 
> Founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]], 
> the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, before recruiting [[Foo_Fighters/Grohl,Dave|Dave Grohl]] in 1990. 
> Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. 
> Despite a short mainstream career spanning only three years, 
> their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.
>
> In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, 
> releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. 
> They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. 
> 
> After signing to the major label DGC Records in 1991, 
> Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", 
> the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). 
> A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond 
> by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.
>
> Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, 
> combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. 
> Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, 
> the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). 
> The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. 
> 
> Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. 
> Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. 
> The live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
>
> Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. 
> During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award, 
> and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. 
> 
> They achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart 
> and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. 
> 
> In 2004, Rolling Stone named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. 
> They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2014.
