# [[Euclid(Sleep_Token)]] 

#is_/part_of :: [[../Sleep_Token]] 
#is_/similar_to :: [[The_Night_does_not_belong_to_God]] 

Ends with the same chords in Major
as [[#The Night does not belong to God]] which starts in Minor, 
so you can mash them up together, literally "entangled endlessly". 

## #has_/lyrics 

Just run it back, give me five whole minutes  
I am thick tar on the inside burning  

I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning  
And a heavy head that won't stop turning  

If my fate is a bad collision  
And if my mind is an open highway  
Give me the twilight two-way vision  
Give me one last ride on a sunset sky-lane  


Call me when you get the chance  
I can feel the walls around me closing in  


Just running forwards, a life like wires  
As I see the past on an empty ceiling  
I play along with the life signs anyway  
But hope to God you don't know this feeling  

Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry  
A parallel I would lay my life on  
So if your wings won't find you heaven  
I will bring it down like an ancient bygone  



Call me when you have the time  
I just need to leave this part of me behind  



Do you remember me  
When the rain gathers?  
And do you still believe  
That nothing else matters?  



For me  
It's still the autumn leaves  
These ancient canopies  
That we used to lay beneath  
  
No, by now  
The night belongs to you  
This bough has broken through  
I must be someone new  
  
No, for me  
(Just run it back, give me five whole minutes  
(I am thick tar on the inside burning)  
It's still the autumn leaves  
(I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning)  
(And a heavy head that won't stop turning)  
  
These ancient canopies  
(If my fate is a bad collision)  
(And if my mind is an open highway)  

We used to lay beneath  
(Give me the twilight two-way vision)  
(Give me one last ride on a sunset sky-lane)  


(Just running forwards, a life like wires)  
(As I see the past on an empty ceiling)  
The night belongs to you  

(I play along with the lies and anyway)  
(But hope to God you don't know this feeling)  
This bough has broken through  



Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry  
A parallel I would lay my life on  
I must be someone new  

So if your wings won't find you heaven  
I will bring it down like an ancient bygone  


The whites of your eyes  
Turn black in the lowlight  
In turning divine  
We tangle endlessly  
Like lovers entwined  

I know for the last time  
You will not be mine  
So give me the night, the night, the night
