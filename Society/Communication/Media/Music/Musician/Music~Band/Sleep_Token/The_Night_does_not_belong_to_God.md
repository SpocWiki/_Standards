```lyrics
When you live, by daylight  
With angels at your side  
In order now, bestowed by  
The light of the sunrise  
  
And you remember everything  
Only 'til the Sun recedes once again  
  
And the night comes down like heaven  
The night comes down like heaven  * 7

  
The whites of your eyes  
Turns black in the low light  
In turning divine  
We tangle endlessly  
  
Like lovers entwined  
I know for the last time  
You will not be mine  
So give me the night, the night, the night  
  
The night comes down like heaven  * 4 

The night comes down like heaven (the whites of your eyes)  
The night comes down like heaven (turn black in the low light)  
The night comes down like heaven (in turning divine)  
The night comes down like heaven (we tangle endlessly)
```
