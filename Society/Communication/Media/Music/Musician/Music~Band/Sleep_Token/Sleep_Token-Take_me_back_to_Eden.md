## Lyrics 


[Verse 1: Full Voice Singing]
I - dream in phosphorescence
Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog
But no one told you where to go

We - dive through crystal waters
Perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre

Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and thе gods grow tired

Reset my patiеnt violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

[Refrain]
I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

[Verse 2 : Hip Hop]
Well, yeah, 
I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, 
choking up brain matter and make-up

Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer I dangle in like cold cuts,
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love
But I'll take a pound of your flesh before you take a piece of my paystub

White roses, black doves
Godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre

Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired

Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

[Verse 3]
I guess it goes to show, does it not?
That we've no idea what we've got
Until we lose it (Until we lose it, until we lose it)

And no amount of love will keep it around,
If we don't choose it (Choose it)

And I don't know what's got its teeth in me,
but I'm about to bite back in anger

No amount of self-sought fury
will bring back the glory of innocence

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre

Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired

Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire
