> Peter, Paul and Mary was an American folk group formed in New York City in 1961 
> during the American folk music revival. 
> 
> The trio consisted of 
> - Peter Yarrow (guitar, tenor vocals), 
> - Paul Stookey (guitar, baritone vocals), and 
> - Mary Travers (contralto vocals).  
> The group's repertoire included songs written by Yarrow, Luis Manuel and Stookey, 
> early songs by Bob Dylan, and covers of other folk musicians.
>
> They were very successful in the early- and mid-1960s, 
> with their debut album topping the charts for weeks, 
> and helped popularize the folk music revival. 
> 
> Following Travers's death in 2009, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo. 
> Yarrow died in 2025, leaving Stookey the sole surviving member of the group.
>
> Travers said she was influenced by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers.  
> In May 1963, Stookey described the formation and dynamics of the group 
> on Folk Music Worldwide, an international short-wave radio show in New York City. 
> 
> In the 2004 documentary Peter, Paul & Mary: Carry It On â€“ A Musical Legacy, 
> members of the Weavers discuss how Peter, Paul and Mary took over 
> the torch of the social commentary of folk music in the 1960s.
>
> The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. 
> Peter, Paul and Mary received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award 
> from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006.
