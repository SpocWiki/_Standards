> Though primarily a guitarist, Oldfield played a range of instruments, 
> which included keyboards and percussion, as well as vocals. 
> He had adopted a range of musical styles throughout his career, 
> including progressive rock, world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient and new age music.
>
> Oldfield took up the guitar at age ten and left school in his teens to embark on a music career. 
> From 1967 to 1970, he and his sister Sally Oldfield were a folk duo, the Sallyangie, 
> after which he performed with Kevin Ayers. 
> In 1971, Oldfield started work on Tubular Bells which caught the attention of Richard Branson,

> and the album went on to sell over 2.7 million copies in the UK. 
> 
> Oldfield followed it with Hergest Ridge (1974), Ommadawn (1975) and Incantations (1978), 
> all of which feature longform and mostly instrumental pieces.
>
> In the late 1970s, Oldfield began to tour and release more commercial and song-based music, 
> beginning with Platinum (1979), QE2 (1980) and Five Miles Out (1982). 
> His most successful album of this period was Crises (1983), 
> which features the worldwide hit single "Moonlight Shadow" with vocalist Maggie Reilly. 
> 
> After signing with WEA in the early 1990s, Oldfield's most significant 
> album of the decade was Tubular Bells II (1992) 
> and he experimented with virtual reality and gaming content with his MusicVR project. 
> In 2012, he performed at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympic Games held in London. 
> Oldfield's discography includes 26 studio albums, nine of which have reached the UK top ten.
