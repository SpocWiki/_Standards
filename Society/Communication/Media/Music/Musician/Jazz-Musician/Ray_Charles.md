> during his time with Atlantic Records. 
> 
> He contributed to the integration of country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music 
> during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, 
> notably with his two Modern Sounds albums. 
> 
> While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians 
> to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.
>
> Charles' 1960s hit "Georgia on My Mind" was the first of 
> his three career No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.

> became his first album to top the Billboard 200.

> 61 on the US R&B singles chart, 33 on the Hot 100 singles chart, 
> and eight on the Hot Country singles charts.
>

> but his music was also influenced by Art Tatum, Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. 
> 
> He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with Quincy Jones. 
> Frank Sinatra called Ray Charles "the only true genius in show business", 
> although Charles downplayed this notion. 
> Billy Joel said, "This may sound like sacrilege, 
> but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley."
>
> For his musical contributions, Charles received the Kennedy Center Honors, 
> the National Medal of Arts, and the Polar Music Prize. 
> 
> He was one of the inaugural inductees at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.

> the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, 
> and 10 of his recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. 
> 
> Rolling Stone ranked Charles No. 10 on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", 
> and No. 2 on their list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time". 
> 
> In 2023, in its revised list for the "200 Greatest Singers of All Time", 
> Charles was replaced at the No. 2 position by Whitney Houston while taking the sixth spot.
