> Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) 
> was an American composer, guitarist, bandleader, actor, comedian, satirist, filmmaker, activist 
> and freedom of speech advocate. 
> 
> In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, 
> orchestral and musique concrète works; 
> he additionally produced nearly all the 60-plus albums he released 
> with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. 
> 
> His work is characterized by nonconformity, improvisation sound experimentation, 
> musical virtuosity and satire of American culture. 
> Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. 
> He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse musicians of his generation.
>
> As a mostly self-taught composer and performer, Zappa had diverse musical influences 
> that led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. 
> While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, 
> African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music. 
> He began writing classical music in high school, 
> while simultaneously playing drums in rhythm-and-blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. 
> His debut studio album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out! (1966), 
> combined satirical but seemingly conventional rock-and-roll songs with extended sound collages. 
> He continued this eclectic and experimental approach throughout his career.
>
> Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", 
> with numerous musical phrases, ideas and characters reappearing throughout his albums. 
> His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures 
> and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the "godfather" of comedy rock. 
> He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, 
> and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, 
> political participation and the abolition of censorship. 
> Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of recreational drug use, 
> but supported decriminalization and regulation.
>
> Zappa was a highly productive and prolific musician with a controversial critical standing; 
> supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, 
> while detractors found it lacking emotional depth. 
> 
> He had greater commercial success outside the U.S., particularly in Europe. 
> Though he worked as an independent artist, 
> Zappa mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major record labels. 
> He remains a major influence on musicians. 
> His many honors include his posthumous 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
> and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
