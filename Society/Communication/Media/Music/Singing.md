> **Singing** is the art of creating music with the voice. 
> 
> It is the oldest form of musical expression, 
> and the human voice can be considered the first musical instrument by some. 
> The definition of singing varies across sources. 
> 
> Some sources define singing as the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. 
> Other common definitions include "the utterance of words or sounds in tuneful succession" 
> or "the production of musical tones by means of the human voice".
>
> A person whose profession (or hobby) is singing is called a singer or a vocalist (in jazz or popular music). 
> 
> Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) 
> that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. 
> 
> Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. 
> Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument 
> (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. 
> Many styles of singing exist throughout the world.
>
> Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers typically receive voice training from vocal coaches or voice teachers throughout their careers.

> Singing should not be confused with rapping as they are not the same. According to music scholar and rap historian Martin E. Connor, "Rap is often defined by its very opposition to singing." While also a form of vocal music, rap differs from singing in that it does not engage with tonality in the same way and does not require pitch accuracy. Like singing, rap does use rhythm in connection to words but these are spoken rather than sung on specific pitches. Grove Music Online states that "Within the historical context of popular music in the United States, rap can be seen as an alternative to singing that could connect directly with stylistic speech practices in African American English." However, some rap artists do employ singing as well as rapping in their music; using the switch between the rhythmic speech of rapping and the sung pitches of singing as a striking contrast to grab the attention of the listener.
