## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Billboard (stylized in lowercase since 2013) is an American music and entertainment magazine 
> published weekly by Penske Media Corporation. 
> 
> The publication group & miscellaneous media corporation provides music charts, 
> news, video, opinion, reviews, events and styles related to the music industry. 
> 
> Its music charts include the Hot 100, Billboard 200, and Global 200, 
> which rank the most popular singles and albums across a wide range of genres 
> based on sales, streaming, and radio airplay. 
> It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm and operates several television shows.
>
> Billboard was founded in 1894 by William Donaldson and James Hennegan 
> as a trade publication for bill posters. 
> Donaldson acquired Hennegan's interest in 1900 for $500. 
> In the early years of the 20th century, it covered the entertainment industry, such as circuses, 
> fairs and burlesque shows, and also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. 
> 
> Billboard began focusing more on the music industry 
> as the jukebox, phonograph and radio became commonplace. 
> 
> Many topics that it covered became the subjects of new magazines, 
> including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, 
> so that Billboard could focus on music. 
> 
> After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was inherited by his and Hennegan's children, 
> who retained ownership until selling it to private investors in 1985. 
> The magazine has since been owned by various parties.
