## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In music theory, a diatonic scale is a heptatonic (seven-note) scale that includes 
> - five whole steps (whole tones) and 
> - two half steps (semitones) in each octave, 
> in which the two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps. 
> In other words, the **half steps are maximally separated from each other**.
>
> The seven pitches of any diatonic scale can also be obtained by using a chain of six perfect fifths. 
> For instance, the seven natural pitch classes that form the C-major scale 
> can be obtained from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F:
> F–C–G–D–A–E–B.
>
> Any sequence of seven successive natural notes, such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, 
> and any transposition thereof, is a diatonic scale. 
> 
> Modern musical keyboards are designed so that **the white-key notes form a diatonic scale**, 
> though transpositions of this diatonic scale require one or more black keys. 
> A diatonic scale can be also described as two tetrachords separated by a whole tone. 
> In musical set theory, Allen Forte classifies **diatonic scales** as set form 7–35.
>
> The term diatonic originally referred to the diatonic genus, 
> one of the three genera of the ancient Greeks, 
> and comes from Ancient Greek: διατονικός, romanized: diatonikós, of uncertain etymology. 
> 
> Most likely, it refers to the intervals being "stretched out" in that tuning, 
> in contrast to the other two genera (chromatic and enharmonic).
>
> This article does not concern alternative seven-note scales such as the 
> - **harmonic** minor or the 
> - **melodic** minor which, although sometimes called "diatonic", 
> do not fulfill the condition of maximal separation of the semitones indicated above.
