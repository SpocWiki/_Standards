# [[Chromatic_Scale]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **chromatic scale** (or twelve-tone scale) is a set of twelve pitches (more accurately pitch classes) 
> used in tonal music, with notes separated by the interval of a semitone. 
> 
> Chromatic instruments, such as the piano, are made to produce the chromatic scale, 
> while other instruments capable of continuously variable pitch, such as the trombone and violin, 
> can also produce **[[Microtones]], notes between those available on a piano**.
>
> Most music uses subsets of the chromatic scale such as [[Diatonic_Scale]]s. 
> While the chromatic scale is fundamental in western music theory, 
> it is seldom directly used in its entirety in musical compositions or improvisation.
