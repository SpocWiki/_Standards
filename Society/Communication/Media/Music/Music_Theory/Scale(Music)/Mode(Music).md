> In music theory, the term mode or modus is used in a number of distinct senses, 
> depending on context.
>
> Its most common use may be described as a type of musical scale 
> coupled with a set of characteristic melodic and harmonic behaviors. 
> 
> It is applied to major and minor keys as well as the seven diatonic modes 
> (including the former as Ionian and Aeolian) which are defined by their starting note or tonic. 
> (Olivier Messiaen's modes of limited transposition are strictly a scale type.) 
> 
> Related to the diatonic modes are the eight church modes or Gregorian modes, 
> in which authentic and plagal forms of scales are distinguished by ambitus 
> and tenor or reciting tone. 
> 
> Although both diatonic and Gregorian modes borrow terminology from ancient Greece, 
> the Greek tonoi do not otherwise resemble their medieval/modern counterparts.
>
> Previously, in the Middle Ages the term modus was used 
> to describe intervals, individual notes, and rhythms (see § Mode as a general concept). 
> Modal rhythm was an essential feature of the modal notation system 
> of the Notre-Dame school at the turn of the 12th century. 
> In the mensural notation that emerged later, modus specifies the subdivision of the longa.
>
> Outside of Western classical music, "mode" is sometimes used to embrace similar concepts 
> such as Octoechos, maqam, pathet etc. (see § Analogues in different musical traditions below).
