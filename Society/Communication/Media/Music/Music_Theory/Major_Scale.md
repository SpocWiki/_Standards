> The major scale (or Ionian mode) is one of the most commonly used musical scales, 
> especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. 
> 
> Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency 
> so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin "octavus", the eighth).
>
> The simplest major scale to write is C major, the only major scale not requiring sharps or flats:
>
> The major scale has a central importance in Western music, 
> particularly that of the common practice period and in popular music.
>
> In Carnatic music, it is known as Sankarabharanam. 
> In Hindustani classical music, it is known as Bilaval.
