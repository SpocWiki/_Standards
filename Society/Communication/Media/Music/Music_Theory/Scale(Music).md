# [[Scale(Music)]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[../../../../../WikiData/WD~Scale,179651|WD~Scale,179651]] 

Over Time, similar Tone Systems were developed independently in different Cultures, 
resulting in the common [[Scale(Music)/Chromatic_Scale|Chromatic_Scale]] with [[Just_Intonation]].  

The tonic center was the most important of all the different tone centers in a piece of music, 
with **most pieces beginning and ending on the tonic**, 
usually modulating to the [[Dominant]] or the [[Subdominant]] which are a full Tone (2 Half-Tones) apart. 

## Pentatonic Scale 

The [[Pentatonic_Scale]] uses only 5 of the 7 Diatonic Keys.
They result from going only 5 Fifths/Quints up: 
C-G-D-A-E or, in order: C-D-E-G-A-C 

The [[Heptatonic_Scale]] uses all 7 Diatonic Keys and it merges ideally with the [[Pentatonic_Scale]], 
resulting in all 7 + 5 = 12 [[Semitone]]s. 

In fact, only the Black Keys yield exactly a [[Pentatonic_Scale]].

## Building a Transposable Tuning

The ratios are for Just Intonation, but they work well **only for C-Major and C-Minor**. 

If you jump in Steps of 3/2 (Fifth/Quinte), you will reach each of the 12 Notes once over 7 Octaves, 
because $(3/2)^12$ = 129.7 ≈ 128 = 2^7   C-G-D-A-E-B-F#/Gb-C#/Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C 
Transposing these Notes down into the same Octave yields the [[Pythagorean_Tuning]], 
which results in a small Mismatch between 2 and 2.03 after the 7th Octave, 
which is often resolved by introducing the [[Wolf_Interval]] when switching from # Notes to b Notes. 

The Equal Tuning uses 12 equal Steps from 1 to 2 with Size $root 12 2$ which results in Deviations of only 1%, 
which few people ever notice. 
More Steps make it worse again, 
unless go up to e.g. 53 or even 72 Sub-Tones and select from them in irregular Steps.
Common Equal Temperaments also use 19, 22, 31, 34 or 41 Sub-Tones.

## Why use Accidentals 

Naming only 7 diatonic Keys from A to H allows to use each of these Keys exactly once 
in each transposed diatonic Keys. 
If all 12 Keys were given Letters, we would need to remember which ones to skip. 

```
A  B  C# D  E  F# G# 
   Bb C  D  Eb F  G  A
   B  C# D# E  F# G# A#
   
      C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C-Scale 
         D  E  F# G  A  B  C#
         
            E  F# G# A  B  C# D#
            
               F  G  A  Bb C  D  E
               F# G# A# B  C# D# E#              
                  G  A  B  C  D  E  F#
                     A  B  C# D  E  F# G# 
```

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In music theory, a scale is "any consecutive series of notes 
> that form a progression between one note and its octave", 
> typically by order of pitch or fundamental frequency. 
>
> The word "scale" originates from the Latin scala, which literally means "ladder". Therefore, any scale is distinguishable by its "step-pattern", or how its intervals interact with each other. 
>
> Often, especially in the context of the common practice period, most or all of the melody and harmony of a musical work is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a staff with a standard key signature.
>
> Due to the principle of octave equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or interval) between two successive notes of the scale. However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by microtonal music, there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.
>
> A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a semitone interval, while a major scale is defined by the interval pattern W–W–H–W–W–W–H, where W stands for whole step (an interval spanning two semitones, e.g. from C to D), and H stands for half-step (e.g. from C to D♭). Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, major, minor, and others.
>
> A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first degree (or tonic). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, C major indicates a major scale with a C tonic.
