> In Western classical music theory, the minor scale refers to three scale patterns 
> - the natural minor scale (or Aeolian mode), 
> - the harmonic minor scale, and 
> - the melodic minor scale (ascending or descending).
>
> These scales contain all three notes of a minor triad: 
> the root, a minor third (rather than the major third, as in a major triad or major scale), 
> and a perfect fifth (rather than the diminished fifth, as in a diminished scale or half diminished scale).
>
> Minor scale is also used to refer to other scales with this property, 
> such as the Dorian mode or the minor pentatonic scale (see other minor scales below).
