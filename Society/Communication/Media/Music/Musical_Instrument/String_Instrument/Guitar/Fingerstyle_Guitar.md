> **Fingerstyle guitar** is the technique of playing the guitar or bass guitar 
> by plucking the strings directly with the fingertips, fingernails, or picks attached to fingers, as 
> opposed to flatpicking (plucking individual notes with a single plectrum, 
> commonly called a "pick"). 
> 
> The term "fingerstyle" is something of a misnomer, 
> since it is present in several different genres and styles of music—but mostly, 
> because it involves a completely different technique, not just a "style" of playing, 
> especially for the guitarist's picking/plucking hand. 
> 
> The term is often used synonymously with fingerpicking except in classical guitar circles, 
> although fingerpicking can also refer to a specific tradition of 
> folk, blues and country guitar playing in the US. 
> 
> The terms "fingerstyle" and "fingerpicking" 
> are also applied to similar string instruments such as the banjo.
>
> Music arranged for fingerstyle playing can include 
> - chords, 
> - arpeggios (the notes of a chord played one after the other, as opposed to simultaneously) 
> and other elements such as 
> - artificial harmonics, 
> - hammering on and pulling off notes with the fretting hand, 
> - using the body of the guitar percussively (by tapping rhythms on the body), 
> and many other techniques. 
> 
> Often, the guitarist will play the melody notes, 
> interspersed with the melody's accompanying chords 
> and the deep bassline (or bass notes) simultaneously. 
> 
> Some fingerpicking guitarists also intersperse 
> percussive tapping along with the melody, chords and bassline. 
> 
> Fingerstyle is a standard technique on the classical or nylon string guitar, 
> but is considered more of a specialized technique on steel string guitars. 
> 
> Fingerpicking is less common on electric guitar. 
> 
> The timbre of fingerpicked notes is described as 
> "result[ing] in a more piano-like attack," and less like pizzicato.
