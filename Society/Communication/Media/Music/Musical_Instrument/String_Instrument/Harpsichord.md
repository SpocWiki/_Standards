> A **Harpsichord** is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard. 
> Depressing a key raises its back end within the instrument, 
> which in turn raises a mechanism with a small plectrum made from quill or plastic 
> that plucks one or more strings. 
> 
> The strings are under tension on a soundboard, which is mounted in a wooden case; 
> the soundboard amplifies the vibrations from the strings so that the listeners can hear it. 
> 
> Like a pipe organ, a harpsichord may have more than one keyboard manual 
> and even a pedal board. 
> 
> Harpsichords may also have stop levers which add or remove additional octaves. 
> Some harpsichords may have a buff stop, which brings a strip of buff leather 
> or other material in contact with the strings, 
> muting their sound to simulate the sound of a plucked lute.
>
> The term denotes the whole family of similar plucked-keyboard instruments, 
> including the smaller virginals, muselar, and spinet. 
> 
> The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque music, 
> both as an accompaniment instrument and as a soloing instrument. 
> During the Baroque era, the harpsichord was a standard part of the continuo group. 
> The basso continuo part acted as the foundation for many musical pieces in this era. 
> 
> During the late 18th century, with the development of the fortepiano 
> (and then the increasing use of the piano in the 19th century) 
> the harpsichord gradually disappeared from the musical scene 
> (except in opera, where it continued to be used to accompany recitative). 
> 
> In the 20th century, it made a resurgence, 
> being used in historically informed performances of older music, in new compositions, 
> and, in rare cases, in certain styles of popular music (e.g., Baroque pop).
