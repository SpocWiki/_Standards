## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The double bass, also known as the upright bass, the acoustic bass, the bull fiddle, or simply bass, 
> is the largest and lowest-pitched chordophone in the modern symphony orchestra 
> (excluding rare additions such as the octobass). 
> It has four or five strings, and its construction is in between that of the gamba and the violin family.
>
> The bass is a standard member of the orchestra's string section, along with violins, violas, and cellos, 
> as well as the concert band, and is featured in concertos, solo, 
> and chamber music in Western classical music. 
> The bass is used in a range of other genres, such as jazz, blues, 
> rock and roll, rockabilly, country music, bluegrass, tango, folk music 
> and certain types of film and video game soundtracks.
>
> The instrument's exact lineage is still a matter of some debate, 
> with scholars divided on whether the bass is derived from the viol or the violin family.
>
> Being a transposing instrument, the bass is typically notated one octave higher than tuned 
> to avoid excessive ledger lines below the staff. 
> The double bass is the only modern bowed string instrument that is tuned in fourths 
> (like a bass guitar, viol, or the lowest-sounding four strings of a standard guitar), 
> rather than fifths, with strings usually tuned to E1, A1, D2 and G2.
>
> The double bass is played with a bow (arco), or by plucking the strings (pizzicato), 
> or via a variety of extended techniques. 
> In orchestral repertoire and tango music, both arco and pizzicato are employed. 
> In jazz, blues, and rockabilly, pizzicato is the norm. 
> 
> Classical music and jazz use the natural sound produced acoustically by the instrument, 
> as does traditional bluegrass. 
> In funk, blues, reggae, and related genres, the double bass is often amplified.
