## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Sousaphone** (SOO-zə-fohn) is a brass musical instrument in the tuba family. 
> Created around 1893 by J. W. Pepper 
> at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa 
> (after whom the instrument was then named), 
> it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, 
> as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. 
> 
> Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, 
> causing them to vibrate or "buzz" into a large cupped mouthpiece. 
> Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; 
> it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, 
> projecting the sound ahead of the player. 
> 
> Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, 
> it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres. 
> 
> Sousaphones were originally made of brass. 
> Beginning in the mid-20th century, 
> some sousaphones have also been made of lighter materials, 
> such as fiberglass and plastic.
