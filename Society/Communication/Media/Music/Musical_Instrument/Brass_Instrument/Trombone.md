## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Trombone** is a musical instrument in the brass family. 
> 
> As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's lips vibrate inside a mouthpiece, 
> causing the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. 
> 
> Nearly all trombones use a telescoping slide mechanism to alter the pitch 
> instead of the valves used by other brass instruments. 
> The valve trombone is an exception, using three valves similar to those on a trumpet, 
> and the superbone has valves and a slide.
>
> The word trombone derives from Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning 'large'), 
> so the name means 'large trumpet'. 
> 
> The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like the trumpet, 
> in contrast to the more conical brass instruments like the cornet, the flugelhorn, the baritone, 
> and the euphonium. 
> 
> The two most frequently encountered variants are the tenor trombone and bass trombone; 
> when the word trombone is mentioned alone; it is mostly taken to mean the tenor model. 
> 
> These are treated as non-transposing instruments, reading at concert pitch in bass clef, 
> with higher notes sometimes being notated in tenor clef. 
> They are pitched in B♭, an octave below the B♭ trumpet and an octave above the B♭ contrabass tuba. 
> 
> The once common E♭ alto trombone became less common 
> as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, 
> but it is regaining popularity for its lighter sonority. 
> 
> In British brass-band music the tenor trombone is treated as a B♭ transposing instrument, 
> written in treble clef, and the alto trombone is written at concert pitch, usually in alto clef.
>
> A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player.
