> Tubular bells (also known as chimes) are musical instruments in the percussion family. 
> Their sound resembles that of church bells, carillons, or a bell tower; 
> the original tubular bells were made to duplicate the sound of church bells within an ensemble. 
> 
> Each bell is a metal tube, 30–38 mm (1+1⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) in diameter, tuned by altering its length. 
> Its standard range is C4–F5, though many professional instruments reach G5. 
> Tubular bells are often replaced by studio chimes, 
> which are smaller and usually less expensive instruments. 
> Studio chimes are similar in appearance to tubular bells, 
> but each bell has a smaller diameter than the corresponding bell on tubular bells.
>
> Tubular bells are usually struck on the top edges of the tubes 
> with a rawhide- or plastic-headed hammer. 
> 
> A sustain pedal may be attached to the instrument 
> to allow damping and un-damping of all the bells at once. 
> Very loud high-pitched overtones can be produced 
> by vibrating the bottoms of the tubes with a violin bow.
>
> The tubes provide a purer tone than solid cylindrical chimes, such as those on a mark tree.
>
> Chimes are often called for in orchestral and concert band repertoire. 
> They rarely play melody, instead being used most often 
> as a color to add to the ensemble sound; 
> but chimes do occasionally have solos, particularly in imitation of church bells.
>
> In tubular bells, modes 4, 5, and 6 appear to determine the strike tone 
> and have frequencies in the ratios 92:112:132, or 81:121:169, 
> "which are close enough to the ratios 2:3:4 for the ear to consider them nearly harmonic 
> and to use them as a basis for establishing a virtual pitch". 
> 
> The perceived "strike pitch" is thus an octave below the fourth mode 
> (i.e., the missing "1" in the above series).
