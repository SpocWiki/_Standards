> A **Cymbal** /ˈsɪm.bəl/ or /ˈsɪm.bəl/ () is a common percussion instrument. 
> Often used in pairs, cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. 
> The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (such as crotales). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride, or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist.
