## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Vibraphone** (also called the vibraharp) 
> is a percussion instrument in the metallophone family. 
> 
> It consists of tuned metal bars and is typically 
> played by using mallets to strike the bars. 
> A person who plays the vibraphone is called a vibraphonist, vibraharpist, or vibist.
>
> The vibraphone resembles the steel marimba, which it superseded. 
> One of the main differences between the vibraphone 
> and other keyboard percussion instruments is that each bar 
> suspends over a resonator tube containing a flat metal disc. 
> 
> These discs are attached together by a common axle 
> and spin when the motor is turned on. 
> 
> This causes the instrument to produce its namesake tremolo or vibrato effect. 
> The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to a piano. When the pedal is up, the bars produce a muted sound; when the pedal is down, the bars sustain for several seconds or until again muted with the pedal.
>
> The vibraphone is commonly used in jazz music, in which it often plays a featured role, 
> and was a defining element of the sound of mid-20th-century "Tiki lounge" exotica, 
> as popularized by Arthur Lyman. 
> 
> It is the second most popular solo keyboard percussion instrument in classical music, 
> after the marimba, and is part of the standard college-level percussion performance education. 
> 
> It is a standard instrument in the modern percussion section for orchestras, 
> concert bands, and in the marching arts (typically as part of the front ensemble).
