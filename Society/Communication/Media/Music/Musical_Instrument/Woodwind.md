> **Woodwind** instruments  are a family of musical instruments within the greater category of wind instruments. 
>
> Common examples include flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone. 
> 
> There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  
> flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). 
> 
> The main distinction between these instruments and other wind instruments 
> is the way in which they produce sound. All woodwinds produce sound by splitting the air blown into them on a sharp edge, such as a reed or a fipple. Despite the name, a woodwind may be made of any material, not just wood. Common examples of other materials include brass, silver, cane, and other metals such as gold and platinum. The saxophone, for example, though made of brass, is considered a woodwind because it requires a reed to produce sound. Occasionally, woodwinds are made of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.
