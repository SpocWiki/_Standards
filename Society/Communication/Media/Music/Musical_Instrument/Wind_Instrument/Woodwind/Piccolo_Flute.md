## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Piccolo** ( PIK-ə-loh; Italian for 'small') is a smaller version of the western concert flute 
> and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. 
> Sometimes referred to as a "baby flute" or piccolo flute, 
> the modern piccolo has the same type of fingering as the standard transverse flute, 
> but the sound it produces is an octave higher. 
> 
> This has given rise to the name ottavino (Italian pronunciation: [ottaˈviːno]), 
> by which the instrument is called in Italian and thus also in scores of Italian composers.
>
> Piccolos are often orchestrated to double the violins or the flutes, 
> adding sparkle and brilliance to the overall sound 
> because of the aforementioned one-octave transposition upwards. 
> 
> The piccolo is a standard member in orchestras, marching bands, and wind ensembles.
