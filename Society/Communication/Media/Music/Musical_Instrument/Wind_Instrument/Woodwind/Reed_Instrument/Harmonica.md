## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Harmonica**, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument 
> used worldwide in many musical genres, 
> notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock. 
> 
> The many types of harmonica include diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. 
> 
> A harmonica is played by using the lips and tongue 
> to direct air into or out of one (or more) holes along a mouthpiece 
> (which covers one edge of the harmonica for most of its length). 
> Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. 
> The most common type of harmonica is a diatonic Richter-tuned instrument 
> with ten air passages and twenty reeds, often called a blues harp. 
> 
> A harmonica reed is a flat, elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, 
> which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. 
> When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, 
> the reed alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.
>
> Reeds are tuned to individual pitches. 
> Tuning may involve changing a reed's length, how heavy it is near its free end, 
> or how stiff it is near its fixed end. 
> Reeds that are longer, heavier, or more flexible produce lower pitches; 
> shorter, lighter, or stiffer reeds produce higher pitches. 
> 
> If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed above or below its slot 
> rather than in the plane of the slot, it responds more easily to 
> air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed. 
> This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed 
> and a draw reed in the same air chamber, 
> and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather (valves, wind-savers) 
> to block the nonplaying reed.
>
> An important technique in performance is bending, 
> causing a drop in pitch by making embouchure adjustments. 
> Bending the pitch of an isolated reed is possible on chromatic models 
> (or any others that have wind-savers), but it is also possible to lower or raise 
> (overbend, overblow, overdraw) the pitch produced by pairs of reeds in the same chamber, 
> as on a diatonic or other unvalved harmonica. 
> 
> Such two-reed pitch changes actually involve sound production by the normally silent reed, 
> the opening reed (for instance, the blow reed while the player is drawing).
