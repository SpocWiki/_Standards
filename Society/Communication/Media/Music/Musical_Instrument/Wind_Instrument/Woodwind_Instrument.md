## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Woodwind** instruments  are a family of musical instruments 
> within the greater category of wind instruments. 
>
> Common examples include flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone. 
> 
> There are two main types of woodwind instruments:  
> flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). 
> 
> The main distinction between these instruments and other wind instruments 
> is the way in which they produce sound. 
> 
> All woodwinds produce sound by splitting the air blown into them on a sharp edge, 
> such as a reed or a fipple. 
> 
> Despite the name, a woodwind may be made of any material, not just wood. 
> Common examples of other materials include brass, silver, cane, 
> and other metals such as gold and platinum. 
> 
> The saxophone, for example, though made of brass, is considered a woodwind 
> because it requires a reed to produce sound. 
> Occasionally, woodwinds are made of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.
