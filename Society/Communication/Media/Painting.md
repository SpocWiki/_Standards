## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Painting** is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of 
> applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called "matrix" or "support"). 
> The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush. 
> 
> Other implements, such as palette knives, sponges, airbrushes, the artist's fingers, 
> or even a dripping technique that uses gravity may be used. 
> 
> One who produces paintings is called a painter.
>
> In art, the term "painting" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). 
> The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, 
> and the painting may incorporate other materials, in single or multiple form, 
> including sand, clay, paper, cardboard, newspaper, plaster, gold leaf, and even entire objects.
>
> Painting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction. 
> 
> Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in portraits, still life and landscape painting--though these genres can also be abstract), 
> photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolist (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).
>
> A significant share of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. 
> Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, 
> to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).
