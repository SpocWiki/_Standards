## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Mass media** include the diverse arrays of media that reach a large audience via mass communication.
>
> Broadcast media transmit information electronically via media 
> such as films, radio, recorded music, or television. 
> 
> Digital media comprises both Internet and mobile mass communication. 
> Internet media comprise such services as email, social media sites, websites, 
> and Internet-based radio and television. 
> 
> Many other mass media outlets have an additional presence on the web, 
> by such means as linking to or running TV ads online, 
> or distributing QR codes in outdoor or print media to direct mobile users to a website. 
> 
> In this way, they can use the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, 
> as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world 
> simultaneously and cost-efficiently. 
> 
> Outdoor media transmits information via such media as augmented reality (AR) advertising; 
> billboards; blimps; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); 
> placards or kiosks placed inside and outside buses, commercial buildings, shops, 
> sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or skywriting. 
> 
> Print media transmit information via physical objects, 
> such as books, comics, magazines, newspapers, or pamphlets. 
> Event organising and public speaking can also be considered forms of mass media.
>
> Mass media organisations or mass media companies that control these technologies 
> include movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations 
> (the latter are also sometimes known as mass media networks); they often form media conglomerates.
