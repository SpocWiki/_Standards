## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Young adult literature (YA) is typically written for readers aged 12 to 18 
> and includes most of the themes found in adult fiction, such as 
> family dysfunction, substance abuse, alcoholism, and sexuality.
>
> The earliest known use of term young adult occurred in 1942. 
> Prior to the 1930s 
> teenagers, adolescents and young adults were still considered children in society. 
> 
> After teenagers were recognized as a distinct social group, 
> librarians developed the category of young adult literature 
> to help bridge the gap between children's literature and adult literature. 
> 
> According to a study conducted in 2023, 
> 55% of young adult literature consumers were over 18 years of age. 
> 78% of adult consumers purchased with the intent to read themselves. 
> Of these adult buyers, 51% were between ages 30 and 44. 
> 
> This highlights the fact that readers of young adult literature are often adults.
