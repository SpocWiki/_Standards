## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> William **Somerset Maugham**  ( MAWM; 25 January 1874 – 16 December 1965) 
> was an English writer, known for his plays, novels and short stories. 
> 
> Born in Paris, where he spent his first ten years, 
> Maugham was schooled in England and went to a German university. 
> He became a medical student in London and qualified as a physician in 1897. 
> 
> He never practised medicine, and became a full-time writer. 
> His first novel, Liza of Lambeth (1897), a study of life in the slums, attracted attention, 
> but it was as a playwright that he first achieved national celebrity. 
> By 1908 he had four plays running at once in the West End of London. 
> He wrote his 32nd and last play in 1933, after which he abandoned the theatre 
> and concentrated on novels and short stories.
>
> Maugham's novels after Liza of Lambeth include 
> - Of Human Bondage (1915), 
> - The Moon and Sixpence (1919), 
> - The Painted Veil (1925), 
> - Cakes and Ale (1930) and 
> - The Razor's Edge (1944). 
> 
> His short stories were published in collections such as The Casuarina Tree (1926) and The Mixture as Before (1940); 
> 
> many of them have been adapted for radio, cinema and television. 
> His great popularity and prodigious sales provoked adverse reactions from highbrow critics, 
> many of whom sought to belittle him as merely competent. 
> More recent assessments generally rank Of Human Bondage – 
> a book with a large autobiographical element – as a masterpiece, 
> and his short stories are widely held in high critical regard. 
> Maugham's plain prose style became known for its lucidity, 
> but his reliance on clichés attracted adverse critical comment.
>
> During the First World War Maugham worked for the British Secret Service, 
> later drawing on his experiences for stories published in the 1920s. 
> 
> Although primarily homosexual, 
> he attempted to conform to some extent with the norms of his day. 
> After a three-year affair with Syrie Wellcome which produced their daughter, Liza, 
> they married in 1917. 
> 
> The marriage lasted for twelve years, but before, during and after it, 
> Maugham's principal partner was a younger man, Gerald Haxton. 
> 
> Together they made extended visits to Asia, the South Seas and other destinations; 
> Maugham gathered material for his fiction wherever they went. 
> 
> They lived together in the French Riviera, where Maugham entertained lavishly. 
> 
> After Haxton's death in 1944, 
> Alan Searle became Maugham's secretary-companion for the rest of the author's life. 
> 
> Maugham gave up writing novels shortly after the Second World War, 
> and his last years were marred by senility. He died at the age of 91.
