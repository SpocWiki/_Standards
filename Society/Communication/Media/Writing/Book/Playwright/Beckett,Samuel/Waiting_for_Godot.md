## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Waiting for Godot (GOD-oh or gə-DOH) is a tragicomedy play 
> by Irish playwright and writer Samuel Beckett, 
> first published in 1952 by Les Éditions de Minuit. 
> 
> It is Beckett's reworking of his own original French-language play titled En attendant Godot, 
> and is subtitled in English as "A tragicomedy in two acts." 
> 
> The play revolves around the mannerisms of the two main characters, 
> Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo), 
> who engage in a variety of thoughts, dialogues and encounters 
> while awaiting the titular Godot, who never arrives. 
> 
> It is Beckett's best-known literary work 
> and is regarded by critics as "one of the most enigmatic plays of modern literature". 
> 
> In a poll conducted by London's Royal National Theatre in the year 1998, 
> Waiting for Godot was voted as "the most significant English-language play of the 20th century."
>
> The original French text was composed between 9 October 1948 and 29 January 1949. 
> 
> The premiere, directed by Roger Blin, was performed at the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris, 
> in January 1953. The English-language version of the play premiered in London in 1955. 
> 
> Though there is only one scene throughout both acts, 
> the play is known for its numerous themes, including those relating to 
> religious, philosophical, classical, social, psychoanalytical, and biographical settings. 
> 
> Beckett later stated that the painting Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819), 
> by Caspar David Friedrich, was a major inspiration for the play.
>
> In Waiting for Godot, the two main characters spend their days 
> waiting for someone named Godot, who they believe will provide them with salvation. 
> 
> They pass the time with conversations, physical routines, and philosophical musings, 
> but their hope fades as Godot never arrives. 
> 
> They encounter two other characters, Pozzo and his servant Lucky. 
> 
> As the play unfolds, the repetition of actions and dialogue 
> suggests the cyclical nature of their lives, and though Godot is promised for "tomorrow", 
> he never appears in the play, leaving the characters in a state of existential uncertainty. 
> 
> Critics have noted that since the play is stripped down to its bare basics, 
> it invites a wide array of social, political and religious interpretations. 
> 
> There are also several references to wartime contexts, 
> and some commentators have stated 
> that Beckett might have been influenced by his own status 
> as the play was written after World War II, 
> during which he and his partner were both forced to leave occupied Paris, 
> due to their affiliation to the French Resistance. 
> 
> Dramatist Martin Esslin said that Waiting for Godot was part of a broader literary movement 
> known as the Theatre of the Absurd, which was first proposed by Albert Camus.
>
> The play has received widespread acclaim. 
> Due to its popularity, significance, and cultural importance to modern literature, 
> Waiting for Godot has often been adapted for stage, operas, musicals, television, 
> and theatrical performances across most of Europe and the Americas. 
> 
> As one of the foundational works of theater, 
> the play remains widely studied in academic and literary circles.
