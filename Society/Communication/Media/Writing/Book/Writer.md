## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Writer** is a person who uses written words in different writing styles, genres and techniques 
> to communicate ideas, to inspire feelings and emotions, or to entertain. 
> 
> Writers may develop different forms of writing such as novels, short stories, monographs, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as reports, educational material, 
> and news articles that may be of interest to the general public. 
> 
> Writers' works are nowadays published across a wide range of media. 
> 
> Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, 
> often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.
>
> The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music, such as songwriter or a screenwriter, 
> but also a stand-alone "writer" typically refers to the creation of written language. 
> Some writers work from an oral tradition.
>
> Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. 
> Other writers use multiple media such as graphics or illustration 
> to enhance the communication of their ideas. 
> 
> Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers 
> for the work of non-fictional technical writers, 
> whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind. 
> 
> Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) 
> or multimedia to augment their writing. 
> In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.
>
> As well as producing their own written works, writers often write about 
> - how they write (their writing process); 
> - why they write (that is, their motivation); 
> - and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism). 
> 
> Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment 
> and may be paid either in advance, or on acceptance, or only after their work is published. 
> Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and **many are not paid for their work**.
>
> The term writer has been used as a synonym of author, 
> although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning 
> and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, 
> even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative. 
> 
> Author most often refers to the writer of a book.
