> Gulliver's Travels, originally titled Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. 
> In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, 
> is a 1726 prose satire by the Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift. 
> 
> The novel satirises human nature and the imaginary "travellers' tales" literary subgenre. It is one of the most famous classics of English literature, is Swift's best-known full-length work, and popularised the fictional island of Lilliput. The English poet and dramatist John Gay remarked, "It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery." The book has been adapted for over a dozen films, movies, radio, and theatrical performances over the centuries.

> The story revolves around Lemuel Gulliver, an adventurous Englishman who travels to a series of strange and distant lands, each inhabited by unusual beings that reflect different aspects of human nature and society. In Lilliput, he encounters tiny people engaged in petty political disputes; in Brobdingnag, he is a small man among giants who criticise European customs; in Laputa, he meets impractical intellectuals disconnected from reality; and in the land of the Houyhnhnms, he finds rational horses living peacefully alongside savage human-like creatures called Yahoos. Through these journeys, the novel satirises the flaws of various civilisations.

> It is uncertain when Swift began writing the novel, but it is considered to have been an attempt at satirising popular literary genres. By mid 1725, the book was finished and as the work was a political satire, it is very likely that Swift had the manuscript copied by another writer so that his own handwriting could not be used as evidence if a legal case should arise. The novel also has numerous made-up words, referred to as Liliputian language, which critics say might have been inspired by Hebrew. On release, the book was an immediate success, and Swift claimed that he wrote Gulliver's Travels "to vex the world rather than divert it". Public opinions were overwhelming positive, with most readers lauding the clever satire, realistic depictions of travel to distant lands, and the political dangers that travelers often face as visitors. However, some critics accused Swift of making use of excessive misanthropy. The English writer William Makepeace Thackeray, in particular, described the novel as being "blasphemous", saying it was overly harsh in its depiction of human societies.
>
> Gulliver's Travels remains popular in modern times due to its insightful social commentary and enduring themes. The novel's satire, particularly its elaborate critique of human nature, societal flaws and norms, and personal relations, continues to be studied in literary circles. Since his death, Swift has emerged as the most widely read and translated Irish author, and Gulliver's Travels has retained its position as the most printed book by an Irish writer in libraries and bookstores worldwide.
