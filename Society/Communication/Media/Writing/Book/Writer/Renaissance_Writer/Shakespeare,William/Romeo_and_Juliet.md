> The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, often shortened to Romeo and Juliet, 
> is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare 
> about the romance between two young Italians from feuding families. 
> 
> It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime 
> and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed. 
> Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.
>
> Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. 
> The plot is based on an Italian tale written by Matteo Bandello, 
> translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562, 
> and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. 
> 
> Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot 
> by developing a number of supporting characters, in particular Mercutio and Paris. 
> 
> Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, 
> the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. 
> The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, 
> and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare's original.
>
> Shakespeare's use of poetic dramatic structure 
> (including effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, 
> the expansion of minor characters, and numerous sub-plots to embellish the story) 
> has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. 
> 
> The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, 
> sometimes changing the form as the character develops. 
> Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.
>
> Romeo and Juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. 
> 
> During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. 
> 
> David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, 
> removing material then considered indecent, 
> and Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted much of the action and used a happy ending. 
> 
> Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, 
> restored the original text and focused on greater realism. 
> 
> John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's text 
> and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. 
> 
> In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted to film in versions as diverse as 
> - George Cukor's Romeo and Juliet (1936), 
> - Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), 
> - Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996), and 
> - Carlo Carlei's Romeo & Juliet (2013).
