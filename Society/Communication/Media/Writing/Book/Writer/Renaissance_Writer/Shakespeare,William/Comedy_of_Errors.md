## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Comedy of Errors** is one of William Shakespeare's earliest plays. 
> It is his shortest and one of his most farcical comedies, 
> with a major part of the humour coming from slapstick and mistaken identity, 
> in addition to puns and word play. 
> 
> It has been adapted for opera, stage, screen and musical theatre numerous times worldwide. 
> In the centuries following its premiere, the play's title has entered the popular English lexicon as an idiom for 
> "an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout".
>
> Set in the Greek city of Ephesus, The Comedy of Errors tells the story of 
> two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated at birth. 
> 
> Antipholus of Syracuse and his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, 
> arrive in Ephesus, which turns out to be the home of their twin brothers, 
> Antipholus of Ephesus and his servant, Dromio of Ephesus. 
> 
> When the Syracusans encounter the friends and families of their twins, 
> a series of wild mishaps based on mistaken identities lead to wrongful beatings, 
> a near-seduction, the arrest of Antipholus of Ephesus, 
> and false accusations of infidelity, theft, madness, and demonic possession.
