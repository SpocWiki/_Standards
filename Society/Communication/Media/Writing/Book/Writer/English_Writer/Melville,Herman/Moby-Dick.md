epigraph:
  - While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver that which is not true.
  - Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before him into a foam.
  - The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six English miles.... Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which, cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four miles.
  - Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of baleen. The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.
  - Which to secure, no skill of leach’s art  <br>   Mote him availle, but to returne againe  <br>   To his wound’s worker, that with lowly dart,  <br>   Dinting his breast, had bred his restless paine,  <br>   Like as the wounded whale to shore flies thro’ the maine.
  - It is impossible to meet a whale-ship on the ocean without being struck by her near appearance. The vessel under short sail, with look-outs at the mast-heads, eagerly scanning the wide expanse around them, has a totally different air from those engaged in regular voyage.
  - The larger whales, they seldom venture to attack. They stand in so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach.
  - “The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the True Whale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe.”
  - Pedestrians in the vicinity of London and elsewhere may recollect having seen large curved bones set upright in the earth, either to form arches over gateways, or entrances to alcoves, and they may perhaps have been told that these were the ribs of whales.
  - Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires,  <br>   And rockets blew self driven, <br>    To hang their momentary fire <br>    Around the vault of heaven.  <br>   “So fire with water to compare,     The ocean serves on high, <br>    Up-spouted by a whale in air,     To express unwieldy joy.
  - A tenth branch of the king’s ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which are whale and sturgeon. And these, when either thrown ashore or caught near the coast, are the property of the king.
  - He visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales, which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.
  - Being once pursued by a whale which he had wounded, he parried the assault for some time with a lance; but the furious monster at length rushed on the boat; himself and comrades only being preserved by leaping into the water when they saw the onset was inevitable.
  - ... and the breath of the whale is frequently attended with such an insupportable smell, as to bring on a disorder of the brain.
  - ‘Stern all!’ exclaimed the mate, as upon turning his head, he saw the distended jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the boat, threatening it with instant destruction;—‘Stern all, for your lives!’
  - “My God! Mr. Chace, what is the matter?” I answered, “we have been stove by a whale.”
  - A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, <br>    The wind was piping free;  <br>   Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale,  <br>   And the phospher gleamed in the wake of the whale,     As it floundered in the sea.
  - And God created great whales.
  - And pray, sir, what in the world is equal to it?
  - And what thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of this monster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goes all incontinently that foul great swallow of his, and perisheth in the bottomless gulf of his paunch.
  - And whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster’s (whale’s) mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, the sea-gudgeon retires into it in great security, and there sleeps.
  - By art is created that great Leviathan, called a Commonwealth or State—(in Latin, Civitas) which is but an artificial man.
  - Here they saw such huge troops of whales, that they were forced to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they should run their ship upon them.
  - I built a cottage for Susan and myself and made a gateway in the form of a Gothic Arch, by setting up a whale’s jaw bones.
  - If we compare land animals in respect to magnitude, with those that take up their abode in the deep, we shall find they will appear contemptible in the comparison. The whale is doubtless the largest animal in creation.
  - If you make the least damn bit of noise,” replied Samuel, “I will send you to hell.
  - If you should write a fable for little fishes, you would make them speak like great whales.
  - Immense as whales, the motion of whose vast bodies can in a peaceful calm trouble the ocean till it boil.
  - In 40 degrees south, we saw Spermacetti Whales, but did not take any till the first of May, the sea being then covered with them.
  - In that day, the Lord with his sore, and great, and strong sword, shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
  - In the afternoon we saw what was supposed to be a rock, but it was found to be a dead whale, which some Asiatics had killed, and were then towing ashore. They seemed to endeavor to conceal themselves behind the whale, in order to avoid being seen by us.
  - "In the year 1690 some persons were on a high hill observing the whales spouting and sporting with each other, when one observed: there—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children’s grand-children will go for bread."
  - In their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean, and in wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes and vents, which nature has placed on their shoulders.
  - Io!  Paean!  Io! sing. <br>    To the finny people’s king.  <br>   Not a mightier whale than this  <br>    In the vast Atlantic is;  <br>   Not a fatter fish than he,  <br>   Flounders round the Polar Sea.
  - It is generally well known that out of the crews of Whaling vessels (American) few ever return in the ships on board of which they departed.
  - It was not till the boats returned from the pursuit of these whales, that the whites saw their ship in bloody possession of the savages enrolled among the crew.
  - Let us fly, let us fly! Old Nick take me if it is not Leviathan described by the noble prophet Moses in the life of patient Job.
  - Leviathan maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.
  - Like Spencer’s Talus with his modern flail <br>    He threatens ruin with his ponderous tail. <br>  ...  <br>   Their fixed jav’lins in his side he wears,  <br>   And on his back a grove of pikes appears.
  - Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that was killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.
  - No, Sir, ’tis a Right Whale,” answered Tom; “I saw his sprout; he threw up a pair of as pretty rainbows as a Christian would wish to look at. He’s a raal oil-butt, that fellow!
  - Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
  - Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and gale  <br>   In his ocean home will be  <br>   A giant in might, where might is right,  <br>   And King of the boundless sea.
  - On one occasion I saw two of these monsters (whales) probably male and female, slowly swimming, one after the other, within less than a stone’s throw of the shore” (Terra Del Fuego), “over which the beech tree extended its branches.
  - She came to bespeak a monument for her first love, who had been killed by a whale in the Pacific ocean, no less than forty years ago.
  - Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing, as if it had been a sprat in the mouth of a whale.
  - So be cheery, my lads, let your hearts never fail, While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!
  - So close behind some promontory lie  <br>   The huge Leviathan to attend their prey,  <br>   And give no chance, but swallow in the fry,  <br>   Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way.
  - "Soon to the sport of death the crews repair: <br>    Rodmond unerring o’er his head suspends  <br>   The barbed steel, and every turn attends."
  - Spain—a great whale stranded on the shores of Europe.
  - Suddenly a mighty mass emerged from the water, and shot up perpendicularly into the air. It was the whale.
  - Ten or fifteen gallons of blood are thrown out of the heart at a stroke, with immense velocity.
  - That sea beast  <br>   Leviathan, which God of all his works   <br>  Created hugest that swim the ocean stream.
  - The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood gushing from the whale’s heart.
  - The great Leviathan that maketh the seas to seethe like boiling pan.
  - "The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in length as four acres or arpens of land."
  - The mighty whales which swim in a sea of water, and have a sea of oil swimming in them.
  - The papers were brought in, and we saw in the Berlin Gazette that whales had been introduced on the stage there.
  - The sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti for an inward bruise.
  - The Spermacetti Whale found by the Nantuckois, is an active, fierce animal, and requires vast address and boldness in the fishermen.
  - The voyages of the Dutch and English to the Northern Ocean, in order, if possible, to discover a passage through it to India, though they failed of their main object, laid-open the haunts of the whale.
  - The whale fell directly over him, and probably killed him in a moment.
  - The whale is a mammiferous animal without hind feet.
  - The Whale is harpooned to be sure; but bethink you, how you would manage a powerful unbroken colt, with the mere appliance of a rope tied to the root of his tail.
  - The Whale-ship Globe, on board of which vessel occurred the horrid transactions we are about to relate, belonged to the island of Nantucket.
  - There go the ships; there is that Leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein.
  - There Leviathan, <br>    Hugest of living creatures, in the deep <br>    Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,  <br>   And seems a moving land; and at his gills  <br>   Draws in, and at his breath spouts out a sea.
  - These things are reciprocal; the ball rebounds, only to bound forward again; for now in laying open the haunts of the whale, the whalemen seem to have indirectly hit upon new clews to that same mystic North-West Passage.
  - This whale’s liver was two cartloads.
  - To fifty chosen sylphs of special note, <br>    We trust the important charge, the petticoat. <br>    Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail, <br>    Tho’ stuffed with hoops and armed with ribs of whale.
  - Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received nothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, insomuch that an incredible quantity of oil will be extracted out of one whale.
  - Very like a whale.
  - We saw also abundance of large whales, there being more in those southern seas, as I may say, by a hundred to one; than we have to the northward of us.
  - WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. Wallen; A.S. Walw-ian, to roll, to wallow.
  - WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval. This animal is named from roundness or rolling; for in Dan. hvalt is arched or vaulted.
  - Whales in the sea God’s voice obey.
  - What spermacetti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned Hosmannus in his work of thirty years, saith plainly, Nescio quid sit.
  - While the whale is floating at the stern of the ship, they cut off his head, and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it will come; but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet water.

  - "In the free element beneath me swam, <br>    Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle, <br>    Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;  <br>   Which language cannot paint, and mariner     Had never seen; from dread Leviathan  <br>   To insect millions peopling every wave:  <br>   Gather’d in shoals immense, like floating islands,  <br>   Led by mysterious instincts through that waste  <br>   And trackless region, though on every side     Assaulted by voracious enemies,  <br>   Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm’d in front or jaw,  <br>   With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs."
  - We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called The Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can’t open his mouth, but that is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.
  - “Nantucket itself,” said Mr. Webster, “is a very striking and peculiar portion of the National interest. There is a population of eight or nine thousand persons living here in the sea, adding largely every year to the National wealth by the boldest and most persevering industry.”
  - Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed.... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.
  - October 13.  “There she blows,” was sung out from the mast-head. <br>    “Where away?” demanded the captain.  <br>   “Three points off the lee bow, sir.”   <br>   “Raise up your wheel.  Steady!”  “Steady, sir.”   <br>   “Mast-head ahoy!  Do you see that whale now?”   <br>   “Ay ay, sir!  A shoal of Sperm Whales!  There she blows!  There she breaches!”   <br>   “Sing out! sing out every time!”   <br>   “Ay Ay, sir!  There she blows! there—there—thar she blows—bowes—bo-o-os!”   <br>   “How far off?”   <br>   “Two miles and a half.”  <br>    “Thunder and lightning! so near!  Call all hands.”

> **Moby-Dick**; or, The Whale is an 1851 epic novel by American writer Herman Melville. 
> 
> The book is centered on the sailor Ishmael's narrative of the maniacal quest of Ahab, 
> captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for vengeance against Moby Dick, 
> the giant white sperm whale that bit off his leg on the ship's previous voyage. 
> 
> A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, 
> Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, 
> and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. 
> 
> Its reputation as a Great American Novel was established only in the 20th century, 
> after the 1919 centennial of its author's birth. 
> 
> William Faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself, 
> and D. H. Lawrence called it "one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world" 
> and "the greatest book of the sea ever written". 
> Its opening sentence, "Call me Ishmael", is among world literature's most famous.
>
> Melville began writing Moby-Dick in February 1850 and finished 18 months later, 
> a year after he had anticipated. 
> 
> Melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, 
> including on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. 
> 
> The white whale is modeled on a notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, 
> and the book's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship Essex in 1820. 
> 
> The detailed and realistic descriptions of sailing, whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, 
> as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, 
> are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. 
>
> The book's literary influences include Shakespeare, Thomas Carlyle, Sir Thomas Browne and the Bible. 
> 
> In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices 
> ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides. 
> 
> In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne 
> and was deeply impressed by his [[Mosses from an Old Manse]], 
> which he compared to Shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions. 
> This encounter may have inspired him to revise and deepen Moby-Dick, 
> which is dedicated to Hawthorne, "in token of my admiration for his genius".
>
> The book was first published (in three volumes) as The Whale in London in October 1851, 
> and under its definitive title, Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, 
> in a single-volume edition in New York in November. 
> 
> The London publisher, Richard Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; 
> Melville made revisions as well, 
> including a last-minute change of the title for the New York edition. 
> 
> The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as "Moby Dick", without the hyphen. 
> Reviewers in Britain were largely favorable, though some objected 
> that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, 
> as the British edition lacked the epilogue recounting Ishmael's survival. 
> 
> American reviewers were more hostile.
