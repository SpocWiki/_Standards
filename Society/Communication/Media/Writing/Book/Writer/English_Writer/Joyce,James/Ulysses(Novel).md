> Ulysses is a modernist novel by the Irish writer [[../Joyce,James|James Joyce]]. 
> 
> Partially serialised in the American journal The Little Review 
> from March 1918 to December 1920, 
> the entire work was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, 
> Joyce's fortieth birthday. 
> 
> It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature 
> and a classic of the genre, having been called 
> "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement".
>
> Ulysses chronicles the experiences of three Dubliners over the course of a single day, 
> 16 June 1904 (which its fans now celebrate annually as Bloomsday). 
> 
> Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, 
> and the novel establishes a series of parallels between 
> - Leopold Bloom and [[../../../../../../../../Philosophy/Metaphysic/Religion/Mythology/Greek_Mythology/Odysseus|Odysseus]], 
> - Molly Bloom and Penelope, and 
> - Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus. 
> 
> There are also correspondences with William Shakespeare's play Hamlet 
> and with other literary, religious, and mythological figures, including 
> Jesus, Elijah, Moses, Dante Alighieri and Don Juan. 
> 
> Such themes as antisemitism, human sexuality, British rule in Ireland, Catholicism 
> and Irish nationalism are treated in the context of early-20th-century Dublin. 
> It is highly allusive and written in a variety of styles.
>
> The writer Djuna Barnes quoted Joyce as saying, "The pity is ... 
> the public will demand and find a moral in my book—
> or worse they may take it in some more serious way, 
> and on the honour of a gentleman, there is not one single serious line in it. ... 
> In Ulysses I have recorded, simultaneously, what a man says, sees, thinks, and 
> what such seeing, thinking, saying does, to what you Freudians call the subconscious."
>
> According to the writer Declan Kiberd, 
> "Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking". 
> Its stream of consciousness technique, careful structuring and 
> prose of an experimental nature—replete with puns, parodies, epiphanies and allusions—
> as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour 
> have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works. 
> 
> Since its publication it has attracted controversy and scrutiny, 
> ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 
> to protracted disputes about the authoritative version of the text.
