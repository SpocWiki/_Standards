> Herman Melville (born Melvill; August 1, 1819 – September 28, 1891) 
> was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the American Renaissance period. 
> 
> Among his best-known works are Moby-Dick (1851); 
> Typee (1846), a romanticized account of his experiences in Polynesia; 
> and Billy Budd, Sailor, a posthumously published novella.  
> 
> At the time of his death Melville was not well known to the public, 
> but 1919, the centennial of his birth, was the starting point of a Melville revival. 
> Moby-Dick would eventually be considered one of the Great American Novels.
>
> Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a prosperous merchant 
> whose death in 1832 left the family in dire financial straits. 
> 
> He took to sea in 1839 as a common sailor on the merchant ship St. Lawrence 
> and then, in 1841, on the whaler Acushnet, but he jumped ship in the Marquesas Islands. 
> 
> Typee, his first book, and its sequel, Omoo (1847), 
> were travel-adventures based on his encounters with the peoples of the islands. 
> Their success gave him the financial security to marry Elizabeth Shaw, 
> the daughter of the Boston jurist Lemuel Shaw. 
> 
> Mardi (1849), a romance-adventure and his first book not based on his own experience, 
> was not well received. 
> Redburn (1849) and White-Jacket (1850), 
> both tales based on his experience as a well-born young man at sea, 
> were given respectable reviews, but did not sell well enough to support his expanding family.
>
> Melville's growing literary ambition showed in Moby-Dick (1851), 
> which took nearly a year and a half to write, but it did not find an audience, 
> and critics scorned his psychological novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). 
> 
> From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, 
> including "Benito Cereno" and "Bartleby, the Scrivener". 
> In 1857, he traveled to England, toured the Near East, 
> and published his last work of prose, The Confidence-Man (1857). 
> He moved to New York in 1863, eventually taking a position as a United States customs inspector.
>
> From that point, Melville focused his creative powers on poetry. 
> Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) 
> was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the American Civil War. 
> 
> In 1867, his eldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. 
> Melville's metaphysical epic Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876. 
> In 1886, his other son Stanwix died of apparent tuberculosis, and Melville retired. 
> During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, 
> and left one volume unpublished. 
> 
> The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at the time of his death, 
> but was published posthumously in 1924. 
> 
> Melville died from cardiovascular disease in 1891.
