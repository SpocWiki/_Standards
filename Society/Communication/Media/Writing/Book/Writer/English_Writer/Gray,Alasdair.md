> Alasdair James Gray (28 December 1934 – 29 December 2019)
>  was a Scottish writer and artist. 
>  
>  His first novel, Lanark (1981), is seen as a landmark of Scottish fiction. 
>  He published novels, short stories, plays, poetry and translations, 
>  and wrote on politics and the history of English and Scots literature. 
>  His works of fiction combine realism, fantasy, and science fiction 
>  with the use of his own typography and illustrations, and won several awards.
>
> He studied at Glasgow School of Art from 1952 to 1957. 
> As well as his book illustrations, he painted portraits and murals, 
> including one at the Òran Mór venue and one at Hillhead subway station. 
> His artwork has been widely exhibited and is in several important collections. 
> Before Lanark, he had plays performed on radio and TV.
>
> His writing style is postmodern and has been compared with those of Franz Kafka, 
> George Orwell, Jorge Luis Borges and Italo Calvino. 
> It often contains extensive footnotes explaining the works that influenced it. 
> His books inspired many younger Scottish writers, including Irvine Welsh, 
> Alan Warner, A. L. Kennedy, Janice Galloway, Chris Kelso and Iain Banks. 
> He was writer-in-residence at the University of Glasgow from 1977 to 1979, 
> and professor of Creative Writing at Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities 
> from 2001 to 2003.
>
> Gray was a Scottish nationalist and a republican, 
> and wrote supporting socialism and Scottish independence. 
> He popularised the epigram "Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation" (paraphrased from a poem by Canadian poet Dennis Lee) 
> which was engraved in the Canongate Wall of the Scottish Parliament Building 
> in Edinburgh when it opened in 2004. 
> 
> He lived almost all his life in Glasgow, married twice, and had one son. 
> On his death The Guardian referred to him as 
> "the father figure of the renaissance in Scottish literature and art".
