> Robinson Crusoe ( KROO-soh) is an English adventure novel by [[../Defoe,Daniel]], 
> first published on 25 April 1719. 
> 
> It is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre, 
> and has been described as the first novel, or at least the first English novel – 
> although these labels are disputed.
>
> Written with a combination of epistolary, confessional, and didactic forms, 
> the book follows the title character (born Robinson Kreutznaer) after he is cast away 
> and spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near the coasts of Venezuela and Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued. 
> 
> The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, 
> a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called "Más a Tierra" 
> (now part of Chile) which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. 
> Pedro Serrano is another real-life castaway whose story might have inspired the novel.
>
> The first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, 
> leading many readers to believe he was a real person 
> and that the book was a non-fiction travelogue. 
> Despite its simple narrative style, Robinson Crusoe was well received in the literary world.
>
> Before the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, 
> and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, 
> spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television, and radio, 
> that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.
