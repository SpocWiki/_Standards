## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Beat Generation** was a literary subculture movement started by a group of authors 
> whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post–World War II era. 
> 
> The bulk of their work was published and popularized 
> by members of the Silent Generation in the 1950s, better known as Beatniks. 
> 
> The central elements of Beat culture are 
> - the rejection of standard narrative values, 
> - making a spiritual quest, 
> - the exploration of American and Eastern religions, 
> - the rejection of economic materialism, 
> - explicit portrayals of the human condition, 
> - experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and 
> - sexual liberation and exploration.
>
> Allen Ginsberg's Howl (1956), William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch (1959), and Jack Kerouac's On the Road (1957) are among the best-known examples of Beat literature. 
> Both Howl and Naked Lunch were the focus of obscenity trials 
> that ultimately helped to liberalize publishing in the United States. 
> The members of the Beat Generation developed a reputation as new bohemian hedonists, 
> who celebrated non-conformity and spontaneous creativity.
>
> The core group of Beat Generation authors—
> Herbert Huncke, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Lucien Carr, and Kerouac—
> met in 1944 in and around the Columbia University campus in New York City. 
> 
> Later, in the mid-1950s, the central figures, except Burroughs and Carr, 
> ended up together in San Francisco, where they met 
> and became friends of figures associated with the San Francisco Renaissance.
>
> In the 1950s, a Beatnik subculture formed around the literary movement, 
> although this was often viewed critically by major authors of the Beat movement. 
> 
> In the 1960s, elements of the expanding Beat movement 
> were incorporated into the hippie and larger counterculture movements. 
> 
> Neal Cassady, as the driver for Ken Kesey's bus Furthur, 
> was the primary bridge between these two generations. 
> 
> Ginsberg's work also became an integral element of early 1960s hippie culture, 
> in which he actively participated. 
> The hippie culture was practiced primarily by older members of the following generation.
