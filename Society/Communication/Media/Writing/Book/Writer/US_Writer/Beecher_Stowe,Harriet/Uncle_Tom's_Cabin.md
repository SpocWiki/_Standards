> **Uncle Tom's Cabin**; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel 
> by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. 
> Published in two volumes in 1852, the novel had a profound effect 
> on attitudes toward African Americans and slavery in the U.S., 
> and is said to have "helped lay the groundwork for the American Civil War".
>
> Stowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary, 
> was part of the religious Beecher family and an active abolitionist. 
> She wrote the sentimental novel to depict the reality of slavery 
> while also asserting that Christian love could overcome slavery. 
> The novel focuses on the character of Uncle Tom, 
> a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of the other characters revolve.
>
> In the United States, Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel 
> and the second best-selling book of the 19th century, following the Bible. 
> It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. 
> The influence attributed to the book was so great that a likely apocryphal story arose 
> of Abraham Lincoln meeting Stowe at the start of the Civil War and declaring, 
> "So this is the little lady who started this great war."
>
> The book and the plays it inspired helped 
> popularize a number of negative stereotypes about black people, 
> including that of the namesake character "Uncle Tom". 
> The term came to be associated with an excessively subservient person. 
> These later associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have, to an extent, 
> overshadowed the historical effects of the book as a "vital antislavery tool". 
> 
> Nonetheless, the novel remains a "landmark" in protest literature, 
> with later books such as The Jungle by Upton Sinclair 
> and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson owing a large debt to it.
