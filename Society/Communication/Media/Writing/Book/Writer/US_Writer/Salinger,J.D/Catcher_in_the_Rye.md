> It was partially published in serial form in 1945–46 before being novelized in 1951.

> 
> The novel also deals with themes of 
> innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, sex, and depression. 
> 
> The main character, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion. 
> Caulfield, nearly of age, gives his opinion on a wide variety of topics 
> as he narrates his recent life events.
>
> The Catcher in the Rye has been translated widely. 
> About one million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books. 
> 
> The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written 
> since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as 
> one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. 
> 
> In 2003, it was listed at number 15 on the BBC's survey "The Big Read".
