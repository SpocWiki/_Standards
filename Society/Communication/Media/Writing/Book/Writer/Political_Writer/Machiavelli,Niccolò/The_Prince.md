> The Prince (Italian: Il Principe [il ˈprintʃipe]; Latin: De Principatibus) 
> is a 16th-century political treatise 
> written by the Italian diplomat, philosopher, and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli 
> in the form of a realistic instruction guide for new princes. 
> 
> Many commentators have viewed that one of the main themes of The Prince is 
> that immoral acts are sometimes necessary to achieve political glory.
>
> From Machiavelli's correspondence, a version was apparently being written in 1513, 
> using a Latin title, De Principatibus (Of Principalities). 
> However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. 
> This was carried out with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, 
> but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of The Prince in manuscript, 
> controversy had swirled about his writings".
>
> Although The Prince was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it was generally agreed as being especially innovative. This is partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice that had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature. Machiavelli illustrates his reasoning using remarkable comparisons of classical, biblical, and medieval events, including many seemingly positive references to the murderous career of Cesare Borgia, which occurred during Machiavelli's own diplomatic career.
>
> The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which practical effect is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Its worldview came in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time, particularly those on politics and ethics.
>
> This short treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works, and the most responsible for the later pejorative use of the word "Machiavellian". It even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "politics" and "politician" in Western countries. In subject matter, it overlaps with the much longer Discourses on Livy, which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for political ends, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli to which The Prince has been compared is the Life of Castruccio Castracani.
