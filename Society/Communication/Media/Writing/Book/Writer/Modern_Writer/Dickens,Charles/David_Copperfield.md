## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> David Copperfield is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, 
> narrated by the eponymous David Copperfield, 
> detailing his adventures in his journey from infancy to maturity. 
> As such, it is typically categorized in the bildungsroman genre. 
> It was published as a serial in 1849 and 1850 and then as a book in 1850.
>
> David Copperfield is also a partially autobiographical novel: 
> "a very complicated weaving of truth and invention", with events following Dickens's own life. 
> Of the books he wrote, it was his favourite. 
> Called "the triumph of the art of Dickens", it marks a turning point in his work, 
> separating the novels of youth and those of maturity.
>
> At first glance, the work is modelled on 18th-century "personal histories" that were very popular, 
> like Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews or Tom Jones, but David Copperfield is a more carefully structured work. 
> It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a bleak picture of childhood in Victorian England, 
> followed by young Copperfield's slow social ascent, as he painfully provides for his aunt, 
> while continuing his studies.
>
> Dickens wrote without an outline, unlike his previous novel, Dombey and Son. 
> Some aspects of the story were fixed in his mind from the start, 
> but others were undecided until the serial publications were underway. 
> 
> The novel has a primary theme of growth and change, but Dickens also satirises many aspects of Victorian life. 
> These include the plight of prostitutes, the status of women in marriage, class structure, 
> the criminal justice system, the quality of schools, and the employment of children in factories.
