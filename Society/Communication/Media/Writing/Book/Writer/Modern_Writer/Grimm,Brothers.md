## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Brothers Grimm (German: die Brüder Grimm or die Gebrüder Grimm), 
> Jacob (1785–1863) and Wilhelm (1786–1859), 
> were German academics who together collected and published folklore. 
> 
> The brothers are among the best-known storytellers of folktales, 
> popularizing stories such as 
> - "Cinderella" ("Aschenputtel"), 
> - "The Frog Prince" ("Der Froschkönig"), 
> - "Hansel and Gretel" ("Hänsel und Gretel"), 
> - "Town Musicians of Bremen" ("Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten"), 
> - "Little Red Riding Hood" ("Rotkäppchen"), 
> - "Rapunzel", 
> - "Rumpelstiltskin" ("Rumpelstilzchen"), 
> - "Sleeping Beauty" ("Dornröschen"), and 
> - "Snow White" ("Schneewittchen"). 
> Their first collection of folktales, Children's and Household Tales (Kinder- und Hausmärchen), 
> was first  published in 1812.
>
> The Brothers Grimm spent their formative years in the town of Hanau in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. 
> Their father's death in 1796 (when Jacob was 11 and Wilhelm 10) 
> caused great poverty for the family and greatly affected the brothers throughout their lives. 
> Both brothers attended the University of Marburg, 
> where they developed a curiosity about German folklore, 
> which grew into a lifelong dedication to collecting German folktales.
>
> The rise of Romanticism in 19th-century Europe revived interest in traditional folk stories, 
> which to the Brothers Grimm represented a pure form of national literature and culture. 
> With the goal of researching a scholarly treatise on folktales, 
> they established a methodology for collecting and recording folk stories 
> that became the basis for folklore studies. 
> Between 1812 and 1857 their first collection was revised and republished many times, 
> growing from 86 stories to more than 200. 
> In addition to writing and modifying folktales, 
> the brothers wrote collections of well-respected Germanic and Scandinavian mythologies, 
> and in 1838 they began writing a definitive German dictionary (Deutsches Wörterbuch), 
> which they were unable to finish.
>
> The popularity of the Grimms' collected folktales has endured. 
> They are available in more than 100 translations and have been adapted by renowned filmmakers, 
> including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney, in films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. 
> 
> In the mid-20th century, Nazi Germany weaponized the tales for propaganda; 
> later in the 20th century, psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed the work's value 
> despite the sexuality, cruelty, and violence in some of the tales' original versions, 
> which were eventually censored by the Grimms themselves.
