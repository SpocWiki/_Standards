## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 – 28 November 1968) was an English children's writer. 
> She is widely regarded as one of the most successful and prolific writers of all time, 
> particularly in the realm of children's literature. 
> 
> Blyton's books have been worldwide bestsellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies, 
> and have been translated into ninety languages. 
> As of June 2019, Blyton held the 4th place for the most translated author. 
> She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. 
> She is best remembered for her Noddy, Famous Five, Secret Seven, the Five Find-Outers, and Malory Towers books, 
> although she also wrote many others, including St. Clare's, The Naughtiest Girl, and The Faraway Tree series.
>
> Her first book, Child Whispers, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. 
> Following the commercial success of her early novels, such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) 
> and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, 
> sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. 
> 
> Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; 
> she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. 
> The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which she produced it 
> led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vehemently denied.
>
> Blyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers, and parents 
> beginning in the 1950s due to the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and her themes, 
> particularly in the Noddy series. 
> 
> Some libraries and schools banned her works, and from the 1930s until the 1950s, 
> the BBC refused to broadcast her stories because of their perceived lack of literary merit. 
> Her books have been criticised as elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, 
> and at odds with the more progressive environment that was emerging in post-World War II Britain, 
> but updated versions of her books have continued to be popular since her death in 1968.
>
> She felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, 
> so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. 
> 
> In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, 
> she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities. 
> The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in Enid, 
> a BBC television film featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role. 
> It was first broadcast in the UK on BBC Four in 2009.
