## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven portal fantasy novels by British author C. S. Lewis. 
> 
> Illustrated by Pauline Baynes and originally published between 1950 and 1956, 
> the series is set in the fictional realm of Narnia, 
> a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals. 
> 
> It narrates the adventures of various children 
> who play central roles in the unfolding history of the Narnian world. 
> 
> Except in The Horse and His Boy, the protagonists are all children from the real world 
> who are magically transported to Narnia, 
> where they are sometimes called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil. 
> 
> The books span the entire history of Narnia, 
> from its creation in The Magician's Nephew to its eventual destruction in The Last Battle.
>
> C.S. Lewis's life and literary influences deeply shaped The Chronicles of Narnia. 
> 
> His childhood experiences – moving to a large house in Belfast, 
> losing his mother at an early age, and attending English boarding schools – 
> paralleled events and settings in Narnia, such as Lucy discovering the magical world 
> or the Pevensies attending school. 
> 
> Lewis also drew extensively on mythology, medieval literature, and cosmology. 
> Works like the Old Irish immrama inspired The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; 
> Michael Ward's Planet Narnia suggests that each Narnia book 
> corresponds to a medieval planet with symbolic traits. 
> 
> Lewis's reading of Plato, George MacDonald, Dante, and John Milton influenced 
> themes, character archetypes, and moral lessons in the series, 
> with elements of Christian theology interwoven through characters like Aslan, 
> though Lewis preferred the term "supposition" over allegory.
>
> The books have had significant influence, shaping literature and popular culture. 
> Writers such as Philip Pullman, Katherine Paterson, and Lev Grossman 
> drew inspiration from Narnia's worlds, characters, and narrative structures. 
> 
> Criticism of the series has focused on perceived 
> inconsistencies, gender stereotyping, and racial representation, 
> but defenders argue that female characters are often portrayed heroically 
> and that themes of morality, courage, and imagination remain central, 
> contributing to the series' lasting appeal.
>
> The Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children's literature 
> and is Lewis's best-selling work, having sold 120 million copies in 47 languages. 
> 
> The series has been adapted for radio, television, the stage, film, and video games.
