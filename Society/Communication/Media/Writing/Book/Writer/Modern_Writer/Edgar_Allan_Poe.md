## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Edgar Allan Poe (né Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) 
> was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic 
> who is best known for his poetry and short stories, 
> particularly his tales involving mystery and the macabre. 
> 
> He is widely regarded as one of the central figures of Romanticism and Gothic fiction 
> in the United States and of early American literature. 
> 
> Poe was one of the country's first successful practitioners of the short story, 
> and is generally considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre. 
> In addition, he is credited with contributing significantly to the emergence of science fiction. 
> He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living exclusively through writing, 
> which resulted in a financially difficult life and career.
>
> Poe was born in Boston. He was the second child of actors David and Elizabeth "Eliza" Poe. 
> His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when Eliza died the following year, 
> Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. 
> 
> They never formally adopted him, but he lived with them well into young adulthood. 
> Poe attended the University of Virginia but left after only a year due to a lack of money. 
> He frequently quarreled with John Allan over the funds needed to continue his education 
> as well as his gambling debts. 
> 
> In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under the assumed name of Edgar A. Perry, 
> he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, 
> which was credited only to "a Bostonian". 
> 
> Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife, Frances, in 1829. 
> However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared his intention to become a writer, 
> primarily of poems, and parted ways with Allan.
>
> Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years 
> working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. 
> His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, 
> and New York City. 
> In 1836, when he was 27, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm. 
> She died of tuberculosis in 1847.
>
> In January 1845, he published his poem "The Raven" to instant success. 
> He planned for years to produce his own journal, The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. 
> But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, 
> under mysterious circumstances. 
> The cause of his death remains unknown and has been attributed to many causes, 
> including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.
>
> Poe's works influenced the development of literature throughout the world 
> and even impacted such specialized fields as cosmology and cryptography. 
> 
> Since his death, he and his writings have appeared throughout popular culture 
> in such fields as art, photography, literary allusions, music, motion pictures, and television. 
> 
> Several of his homes are dedicated museums. 
> In addition, The Mystery Writers of America presents an annual Edgar Award 
> for distinguished work in the mystery genre.
