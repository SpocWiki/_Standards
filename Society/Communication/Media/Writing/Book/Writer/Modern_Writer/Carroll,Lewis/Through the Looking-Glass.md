> **Through the Looking-Glass**, and What Alice Found There 
> is a novel published in December 1871 by Lewis Carroll, 
> the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 
> a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford. 
> 
> It is the sequel to his Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), 
> in which many of the characters were anthropomorphic playing cards. 
> 
> In this second novel the theme is chess. 
> 
> As in the earlier book, the central figure, Alice, enters a fantastical world, 
> this time by climbing through a large looking-glass (a mirror) 
> into a world that she can see beyond it. 
> 
> There she finds that, just as in a reflection, things are reversed, including logic 
> (for example, running helps one remain stationary, 
> walking away from something brings one towards it, 
> chessmen are alive and nursery-rhyme characters are real). 
> 
> Among the characters Alice meets are the severe Red Queen, 
> the gentle and flustered White Queen, 
> the quarrelsome twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, 
> the rude and opinionated Humpty Dumpty, 
> and the kindly but impractical White Knight. 
> 
> Eventually, as in the earlier book, after a succession of strange adventures, 
> Alice wakes and realises she has been dreaming. 
> As in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the original illustrations are by John Tenniel.
> 
> The book contains several verse passages, including 
> - Jabberwocky, 
> - The Walrus and the Carpenter and 
> - the White Knight's ballad, "A-sitting On a Gate". 
> 
> Like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, 
> the book introduces phrases that have become common currency, including 
> - "jam to-morrow and jam yesterday – but never jam to-day", 
> - "sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast", 
> - "un-birthday presents", 
> - "portmanteau words" and 
> - "as large as life and twice as natural".
> 
> Through the Looking Glass has been adapted for the stage and the screen 
> and translated into many languages. 
> 
> Critical opinion of the book has generally been favourable 
> and either ranked it on a par with its predecessor or else only just short of it.
