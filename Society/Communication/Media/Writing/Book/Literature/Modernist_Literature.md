> Modernist literature originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
> and is characterised by a self-conscious separation from traditional ways of writing 
> in both poetry and prose fiction writing. 
> 
> Modernism experimented with literary form and expression, 
> as exemplified by Ezra Pound's maxim to "Make it new". 
> 
> This literary movement was driven by a conscious desire 
> to overturn traditional modes of representation and express the new sensibilities of the time. 
> 
> The immense human costs of the First World War 
> saw the prevailing assumptions about society reassessed, 
> and much modernist writing engages with 
> the technological advances and societal changes of modernity moving into the 20th century. 
> 
> In Modernist Literature, Mary Ann Gillies notes that these literary themes 
> share the "centrality of a conscious break with the past", one that 
> "emerges as a complex response across continents and disciplines to a changing world".
