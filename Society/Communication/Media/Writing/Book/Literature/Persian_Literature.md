> Persian literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Persian language 
> and is one of the world's oldest literatures. 
> It spans over two-and-a-half millennia. 
> 
> Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day 
> Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Kurdistan Region, the Caucasus, and Turkey, 
> regions of Central Asia (such as Tajikistan), South Asia 
> and the Balkans where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language.
>
> For example, Rumi, one of the best-loved Persian poets, born in Balkh (in modern-day Afghanistan) 
> or Wakhsh (in modern-day Tajikistan), wrote in Persian and lived in Konya (in modern-day Turkey), at that time the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. 
> 
> The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia 
> and adopted Persian as their court language. 
> 
> There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia, as well as the Balkans. 
> 
> Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians or Iranians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included.
>
> At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, Indic and Slavic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.
>
> Described as one of the great literatures of humanity, 
> including Goethe's assessment of it as one of the four main bodies of world literature, 
> Persian literature has its roots in surviving works of Middle Persian and Old Persian, 
> the latter of which dates back as far as 522 BCE, 
> the date of the earliest surviving Achaemenid inscription, the Behistun Inscription. 
> 
> The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, 
> comes from the times following the Muslim conquest of Persia c. 650 CE. 
> 
> After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), 
> the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic Caliphate 
> and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. 
> 
> The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana 
> because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties of post-Islamic Iran such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.
>
> Persian poets such as Ferdowsi, Saadi, Hafiz, Attar, Nezami, Rumi and Omar Khayyam 
> are also known in the West and have influenced the literature of many countries.
