> Hebrew literature consists of ancient, medieval, and modern writings in the Hebrew language. 
> It is one of the primary forms of Jewish literature, 
> though there have been cases of literature written in Hebrew by non-Jews, 
> mostly among the Arab citizens of Israel. 
> 
> Hebrew literature was produced in many different parts of the world 
> throughout the medieval and modern eras, 
> while contemporary Hebrew literature is largely Israeli literature.
>
> In 1966, Agnon won the Nobel Prize for Literature for novels and short stories 
> that employ a unique blend of biblical, Talmudic and modern Hebrew, 
> making him the first Hebrew writer to receive this award.
>
> There have been many bibliographies recording Hebrew books and authors, 
> one of the most comprehensive being The Bibliography of the Hebrew Book 1473-1960, 
> a bibliography of all printed Hebrew books published before 1960 
> which lists some 12,000 authors and 9000 titles.
