> **English literature** is a form of literature written in the English language from the English-speaking world. 
> The English language has developed over more than 1,400 years. 
> The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects 
> brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century, are called Old English. 
> 
> Beowulf is the most famous work in Old English. 
> Despite being set in Scandinavia, it has achieved national epic status in England. 
> However, following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, 
> the written form of the Anglo-Saxon language became less common. 
> 
> Under the influence of the new aristocracy, 
> French became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. 
> 
> The English spoken after the Normans came is known as Middle English. 
> This form of English lasted until the 1470s, when the Chancery Standard (late Middle English), 
> a London-based form of English, became widespread. 
> 
> Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales, was a significant figure 
> developing the legitimacy of vernacular Middle English 
> at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin. 
> 
> The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 
> also helped to standardise the language, as did the King James Bible (1611), and the Great Vowel Shift. 
>
> Poet and playwright William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language 
> and one of the world's greatest dramatists. 
> His plays have been translated into every primary living language 
> and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. 
> 
> In the nineteenth century, Sir Walter Scott's historical romances 
> inspired a generation of European painters, composers, and writers.
>
> The English language spread throughout the world 
> with the development of the British Empire between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. 
> At its height, it was the largest empire in history. 
> 
> By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23% of the world population at the time. 
> During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 
> these colonies and the US started to produce their significant literary traditions in English. 
> 
> Cumulatively, from 1907 to the present, writers from Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, 
> the US, and former British colonies have received the Nobel Prize in Literature for works in English: 
> more than in any other language.
