> The **Nibelungenlied** (German pronunciation: [ˈniːbəlʊŋən-], [ˈnɪbəlʊŋən-] 
> or [ˌniːbəˈlʊŋənˌliːt] ; Middle High German: Der Nibelunge liet or Der Nibelunge nôt), 
> translated as The Song of the Nibelungs, is an epic poem 
> written around 1200 in Middle High German. 
> 
> Its anonymous poet was likely from the region of Passau. 
> The Nibelungenlied is based on an oral tradition of Germanic heroic legend 
> that has some of its origin in historic events and individuals of the 5th and 6th centuries 
> and that spread throughout almost all of Germanic-speaking Europe. 
> Scandinavian parallels to the German poem are found 
> especially in the heroic lays of the Poetic Edda and in the Völsunga saga.
>
> The poem is split into two parts. 
> In the first part, the prince Siegfried comes to Worms 
> to acquire the hand of the Burgundian princess Kriemhild from her brother King Gunther. 
> Gunther agrees to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild 
> if Siegfried helps Gunther acquire the warrior-queen Brünhild as his wife. 
> Siegfried does this and marries Kriemhild; however, Brünhild and Kriemhild become rivals, 
> leading eventually to Siegfried's murder by the Burgundian vassal Hagen with Gunther's involvement. 
>
> In the second part, the widow Kriemhild is married to Etzel, king of the Huns. 
> She later invites her brother and his court to visit Etzel's kingdom intending to kill Hagen. 
> Her revenge results in the death of all the Burgundians who came to Etzel's court 
> as well as the destruction of Etzel's kingdom and the death of Kriemhild herself.
>
> The Nibelungenlied was the first heroic epic put into writing in the German vernacular, 
> helping to found a larger genre of written heroic poetry there. 
> 
> The poem's tragedy appears to have bothered its medieval audience, 
> and very early on a sequel was written, 
> the Nibelungenklage, which made the tragedy less final. 
> 
> The poem was forgotten after around 1500 but was rediscovered in 1755. 
> Dubbed the "German Iliad", 
> the Nibelungenlied began a new life as the German national epic. 
> 
> The poem was appropriated for nationalist purposes 
> and was heavily used in anti-democratic, reactionary, 
> and Nazi propaganda before and during the Second World War. 
> 
> Its legacy today is most visible in Richard Wagner's operatic cycle 
> Der Ring des Nibelungen, which, however, is mostly based on Old Norse sources. 
> 
> In 2009, the three main manuscripts of the Nibelungenlied 
> were inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register 
> in recognition of their historical significance. 
> 
> It has been called "one of the most impressive, and certainly the most powerful, 
> of the German epics of the Middle Ages".
