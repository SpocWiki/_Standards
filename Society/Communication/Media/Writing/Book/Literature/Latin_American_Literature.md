> Latin American literature consists of the oral and written literature of Latin America 
> in several languages, particularly in Spanish, Portuguese, 
> and the indigenous languages of Latin America. 
> 
> Latin American literature rose to particular prominence globally 
> during the second half of the 20th century, 
> largely due to the international success of the style known as magical realism. 
> 
> As such, the region's literature is often associated solely with this style, 
> with the 20th century literary movement known as Latin American Boom, 
> and with its most famous exponent, Gabriel García Márquez. 
> 
> Latin American literature has a rich and complex tradition of literary production 
> that dates back many centuries.
