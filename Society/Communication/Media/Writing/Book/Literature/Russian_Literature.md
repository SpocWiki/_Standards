> Russian literature refers to the literature of Russia, its émigrés, 
> and to Russian-language literature. 
> 
> Major contributors to Russian literature, as well as English for instance, 
> are authors of different ethnic origins, including bilingual writers, 
> such as Kyrgyz novelist Chinghiz Aitmatov.  
> 
> At the same time, Russian-language literature does not include works 
> by authors from the Russian Federation 
> who write exclusively or primarily in the native languages 
> of the indigenous non-Russian ethnic groups in Russia, 
> thus the famous Dagestani poet Rasul Gamzatov is omitted.
>
> The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Early Middle Ages 
> when Old Church Slavonic was introduced as a liturgical language 
> and became used as a literary language. 
> 
> The native Russian vernacular remained the use within oral literature 
> as well as written for decrees, laws, messages, chronicles, military tales, and so on. 
> 
> By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, 
> and from the early 1830s, 
> Russian literature underwent an astounding "Golden Age" in poetry, prose and drama. 
> 
> The Romantic movement contributed to a flowering of literary talent: 
> poet Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. 
> Mikhail Lermontov was one of the most important poets and novelists. 
> Nikolai Gogol and Ivan Turgenev wrote masterful short stories and novels. 
> Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy became internationally renowned. 
> 
> Other important figures were Ivan Goncharov, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and Nikolai Leskov. 
> 
> In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories 
> and became a leading dramatist. 
> The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century 
> is sometimes called the Silver Age of Russian poetry. 
> The poets most often associated with the "Silver Age" are Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilyov, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Marina Tsvetaeva. This era produced novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Alexander Belyaev, Andrei Bely and Maxim Gorky.
>
> After the Russian Revolution of 1917, literature split into Soviet and white émigré parts. 
> While the Soviet Union assured universal literacy 
> and a highly developed book printing industry, 
> it also established ideological censorship. 
> 
> In the 1930s Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia. 
> Its leading figures were Nikolay Ostrovsky, Alexander Fadeyev 
> and other writers, who laid the foundations of this style. 
> 
> Ostrovsky's novel How the Steel Was Tempered 
> has been among the most popular works of Russian Socrealist literature. 
> 
> Some writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrei Platonov and Daniil Kharms were criticized and wrote with little or no hope of being published. 
> 
> Various émigré writers, such as poets Vladislav Khodasevich, Georgy Ivanov and Vyacheslav Ivanov; novelists such as Ivan Shmelyov, Gaito Gazdanov, Vladimir Nabokov and Bunin, continued to write in exile. Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology, like Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov, who wrote about life in the gulag camps. The Khrushchev Thaw brought some fresh wind to literature and poetry became a mass cultural phenomenon. This "thaw" did not last long; in the 1970s, some of the most prominent authors were banned from publishing and prosecuted for their anti-Soviet sentiments.
>
> The post-Soviet end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature, with few distinct voices. Among the most discussed authors of this period were novelists Victor Pelevin and Vladimir Sorokin, and the poet Dmitri Prigov. In the 21st century, a new generation of Russian authors appeared, differing greatly from the postmodernist Russian prose of the late 20th century, which led critics to speak about "new realism".
>
> Russian authors have significantly contributed to numerous literary genres. Russia has five Nobel Prize in Literature laureates. As of 2011, Russia was the fourth largest book producer in the world in terms of published titles. A popular folk saying claims Russians are "the world's most reading nation". As the American scholar Gary Saul Morson notes, "No country has ever valued literature more than Russia."
