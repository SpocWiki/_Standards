## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Haiku** (俳句; English: , Japanese: [hai.kɯ(ꜜ)] ) is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. 
> Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 morae (called on in Japanese) 
> in a 5, 7, 5 pattern; that include a kireji, or "cutting word"; and a kigo, or seasonal reference. 
> 
> However, haiku by classical Japanese poets, such as Matsuo Bashō, 
> also deviate from the 17-on pattern and sometimes do not contain a kireji. 
> Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senryū.
>
> Haiku originated as an opening part of a larger Japanese genre of poetry called renga. 
> These haiku written as an opening stanza were known as hokku 
> and over time they began to be written as stand-alone poems. 
> Haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.
>
> Originally from Japan, haiku today are written by authors worldwide. 
> Haiku in English and haiku in other languages have different styles and traditions 
> while still incorporating aspects of the traditional haiku form. 
> 
> Non-Japanese language haiku vary widely on how closely they follow traditional elements. 
> Additionally, a minority movement within modern Japanese haiku (現代俳句, gendai-haiku), 
> supported by Ogiwara Seisensui and his disciples, 
> has varied from the tradition of 17 on as well as taking nature as their subject.
>
> In Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed as a single line, 
> while haiku in English often appear as three lines, although variations exist. 
> 
> There are several other forms of Japanese poetry related to haiku, such as tanka, 
> as well as other art forms that incorporate haiku, such as haibun and haiga.
