> In poetry, an epic is a lengthy narrative poem typically 
> about the extraordinary deeds of extraordinary characters who, 
> in dealings with gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the mortal universe for their descendants. 
> 
> With regard to oral tradition, epic poems consist of formal speech and are usually learnt word for word, contrasted with narratives that consist of everyday speech, categorised into 'factual' or fiction, the former of which is less susceptible to variation.
>
> Influential epics that have shaped Western literature and culture include Homer's Iliad and Odyssey; Virgil's Aeneid; and the anonymous Beowulf and Epic of Gilgamesh. The genre has inspired the adjective epic as well as derivative works in other mediums (such as epic films) that evoke or emulate the characteristics of epics.
