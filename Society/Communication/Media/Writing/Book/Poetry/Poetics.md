> **Poetics** is the study or theory of poetry, 
> specifically the study or theory of device, structure, form, type, and effect 
> with regards to poetry, though usage of the term can also refer to literature broadly. 
> 
> Poetics is distinguished from hermeneutics by its focus on the synthesis of non-semantic elements in a text rather than its semantic interpretation. Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.

> A poem does help shaping anews significances by acknowledging world around 
>
> When we think about philosophical Poetry, an aesthetics attitude comes to perform "structure, form, type, and effect with regards to poetry" by anews characters annoucing poetics within differences between kinds, just to a single presentation, expressing through Greek Italic mimesis, and so, being at all fiction by letter;
>
> These have equally remarks about differences between poetry and other art forms reflecting relations between orally poetry [poetry delivery], letter poetry and, at least, by others lines poetry; 
>
> Aristotle Poetics is an Early philosophical Treatise, and also Plato Dialogues’, shows these expectation by thinking that something important hangs in poetry assessment, that for instants goes significantly beyond getting details in a philosophical mode - a deep relation between philosophy and Poetry have to be considered within comprehensive Word-perspective that, in case, reveling Ethics, Politics, Physics, Theology, and Knowledge Positions;

>
> Poetics presents, in this way, three distinct internal logic acts by at first, understanding the Natures’ Poem, mediating disjunctive logic as pleasure aesthetic expression by tragedy paradox; Poetry and Sensitivity, mediating Rhetorical Logic as Ethical Synthesis Expression about Love-Desire-Justice, so typical at Poetic Treatise; and, finally, Poetic Prose, mediating Didactic Logic Inherent to the Knowledge about Distinct Word Possible Meaning Within Greek Italic Mímesis;

> «In this sense, the whole work is made up within Awarded Episodies by Philosophical Poetics by na properly tato singularity witch knows about knowing how to touch, reveling Intuitive Poetics, through Greek Italic Mímesis mediating the Being-Knowing-how-to-be-in-Being Through Sacred Form Expression, and thus emphasizing the Poetry Dynamic Poetry Circularity by own Poetic Time!»
