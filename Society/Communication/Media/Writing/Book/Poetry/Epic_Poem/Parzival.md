> **Parzival** (German pronunciation: [ˈpaʁtsifal]) is a medieval chivalric romance 
> by the poet and knight Wolfram von Eschenbach in Middle High German. 
> 
> The poem, commonly dated to the first quarter of the 13th century, 
> centers on the Arthurian hero Parzival (Percival in English) 
> and his long quest for the Holy Grail following his initial failure to achieve it.
>
> Parzival begins with the knightly adventures of Parzival's father, Gahmuret, 
> his marriage to Herzeloyde (Middle High German: herzeleide, "heart's sorrow"), 
> and the birth of Parzival. 
> 
> The story continues as Parzival meets three elegant knights, decides to seek King Arthur, 
> and continues a spiritual and physical search for the Grail. 
> 
> A long section is devoted to Parzival's friend Gawan 
> and his adventures defending himself from a false murder charge 
> and winning the hand of the maiden Orgeluse. 
> 
> Among the most striking elements of the work are its emphasis on the importance of 
> humility, compassion, sympathy and the quest for spirituality. 
> A major theme in Parzival is love: 
> heroic acts of chivalry are inspired by true love, which is ultimately fulfilled in marriage.
>
> Regarded as one of the masterpieces of the Middle Ages, 
> the romance was the most popular vernacular verse narrative in medieval Germany, 
> and continues to be read and translated into modern languages around the world. 
> 
> Wolfram began a prequel, Titurel, which was later continued by another writer, 
> while two full romances were written adapting Wolfram's story of Loherangrin. 
> 
> Richard Wagner based his famous opera Parsifal, finished in 1882, on Parzival.
