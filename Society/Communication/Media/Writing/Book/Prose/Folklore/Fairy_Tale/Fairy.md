> A **Fairy** (also called fay, fae, fae folk, fey, fair folk, or faerie) 
> is a type of mythical being or legendary creature, generally described as anthropomorphic, 
> found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, and French folklore), 
> a form of spirit, often with metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural qualities.
>
> Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin 
> but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources. 
> Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include 
> casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, 
> as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, 
> as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature.
>
> The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with 
> human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. 
> 
> At other times, it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. 
> Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to "enchanted" or "magical". 
> It was also used as a name for the place these beings come from: Fairyland.
>
> A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to **ward off fairies using protective charms**. 
> Common examples of such charms include church bells, 
> wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food. 
> 
> Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations 
> and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps. 
> Before the advent of modern medicine, 
> fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities.
>
> In addition to their folkloric origins, 
> fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic 
> art and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. 
> The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
