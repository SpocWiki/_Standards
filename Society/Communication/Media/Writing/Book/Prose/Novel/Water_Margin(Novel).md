> Water Margin (simplified Chinese: 水浒传; traditional Chinese: 水滸傳; 
> pinyin: Shuǐhǔ Zhuàn), also called Outlaws of the Marsh or All Men Are Brothers, 
> is a Chinese novel from the Ming dynasty 
> that is one of the preeminent Classic Chinese Novels. 
> 
> Attributed to Shi Nai'an, Water Margin was one of the earliest Chinese novels 
> written in vernacular Mandarin Chinese. 
>
> Set during the Northern Song dynasty (around 1120), 
> the story follows a group of 108 outlaws who gathers at Mount Liang 
> (also known as Liangshan Marsh) to rebel against the government. 
> 
> Later they are granted amnesty and enlisted by the government 
> to resist the nomadic conquest of the Liao dynasty and other rebels. 
> 
> While the book's authorship is traditionally attributed to Shi Nai'an (1296–1372), 
> the first external reference to the novel only appeared in 1524 
> during the Jiajing reign of the Ming dynasty, 
> sparking a long-lasting academic debate on when it was actually written 
> and which historical events the author had witnessed that inspired him to write the book.

> The novel is considered one of the masterpieces of

> 
> It has introduced readers to some of the best-known characters in Chinese literature, 
> such as Wu Song, Lin Chong, Pan Jinlian, Song Jiang and Lu Zhishen.  
> 
> Water Margin also exerted a significant influence on the 
> development of fiction elsewhere in East Asia, such as on Japanese literature.
