> The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is the principal historical dictionary of the English language, 
> published by Oxford University Press (OUP), a University of Oxford publishing house. 
> 
> The dictionary, which began publication in 1884, 
> traces the historical development of the English language, 
> providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, 
> and provides ongoing descriptions of English language usage in its variations around the world.
>
> Work began on the dictionary in 1857, although publication did not commence until 1884. 
> The work then began to be issued incrementally in unbound fascicles (instalments), 
> as work continued on other parts of the project. 
> 
> The original title was A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; 
> Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. 
> 
> In 1895, the title The Oxford English Dictionary was first used unofficially 
> on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in 10 bound volumes.
>
> In 1933, the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences 
> in its reprinting as 12 volumes with a one-volume supplement. 
> 
> More supplements came over the years until 1989, 
> when the second edition was published, comprising 21,728 pages in 20 volumes. 
> 
> Since 2000, compilation of a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, 
> approximately half of which was complete by 2018.
>
> In 1988, the first electronic version of the dictionary was made available, 
> and the online version has been available since 2000. 
> 
> By April 2014, it was receiving over two million visits per month. 
> The third edition of the dictionary is expected to be available exclusively in electronic form; 
> the CEO of OUP has stated that it is unlikely that it will ever be printed.
