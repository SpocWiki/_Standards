> The Encyclopædia Britannica (Latin for 'British Encyclopaedia') 
> is a general-knowledge English-language encyclopaedia. 
> It has been published since 1768, and after several ownership changes 
> is currently owned by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.. 
> 
> The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition. 
> Since 2016, it has been published exclusively as an online encyclopaedia at the website Britannica.com.
>
> Printed for 244 years, the Britannica was the longest-running in-print encyclopaedia in the English language. 
> It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland, 
> in weekly installments that came together to form in three volumes. 
> 
> At first, the encyclopaedia grew quickly in size. 
> The second edition extended to 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810), 
> the Britannica had expanded to 20 volumes. 
> Since the beginning of the twentieth century, its size has remained roughly steady, with about 40 million words.
>
> The Britannica's rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, 
> and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. 
> Starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, 
> the Britannica shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. 
> Though published in the United States since 1901, 
> the Britannica has for the most part maintained British English spelling.
>
> In 1932, the Britannica adopted a policy of "continuous revision," 
> in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. 
> The publishers of Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia had already pioneered such a policy.
>
> The 15th edition (1974–2010) has a three-part structure: 
> - a 12-volume Micropædia of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), 
> - a 17-volume Macropædia of long articles (two to 310 pages), and 
> - a single Propædia volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. 
> 
> The Micropædia was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the Macropædia; readers are advised to study the Propædia outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. 
>
> In the 21st century, the Britannica suffered from competition 
> - first from the digital multimedia encyclopaedia Microsoft Encarta, and 
> - later with the online peer-produced encyclopaedia Wikipedia.
>
> In March 2012, it announced it would no longer publish printed editions and would focus instead on the online version.
