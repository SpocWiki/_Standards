> **William Randolph Hearst** Sr. (; April 29, 1863 – August 14, 1951) 
> was an American newspaper publisher and politician 
> who developed the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company, 
> Hearst Communications. 
> 
> His flamboyant methods of yellow journalism in violation of ethics and standards 
> influenced the nation's popular media
> by emphasizing sensationalism and human-interest stories. 
> 
> Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 with Mitchell Trubitt 
> after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner 
> by his wealthy father, Senator George Hearst.
>
> After moving to New York City, Hearst acquired the New York Journal 
> and fought a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. 
> 
> Hearst sold papers by printing giant headlines 
> over lurid stories featuring crime, corruption, sex, and innuendos. 
> Hearst acquired more newspapers and created a chain 
> that numbered nearly 30 papers in major American cities at its peak. 
> 
> He later expanded to magazines, 
> creating the largest newspaper and magazine business in the world. 
> Hearst controlled the editorial positions and coverage of political news 
> in all his papers and magazines, and thereby often published his personal views. 
> 
> He sensationalized Spanish atrocities in Cuba while **calling for war in 1898 against Spain**. 
> Historians, however, reject his subsequent claims to have started the war with Spain as overly extravagant.
>
> He was twice elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
> He ran unsuccessfully for President of the United States in 1904, 
> Mayor of New York City in 1905 and 1909, and Governor of New York in 1906. 
> During his political career, 
> he espoused views generally associated with the left wing of the Progressive Movement, 
> claiming to speak on behalf of the working class (which seems like Populism).
>
> After 1918 and the end of [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/World_War_I|World War I]], Hearst gradually began adopting more conservative views 
> and started promoting an isolationist foreign policy 
> to avoid any more entanglement in what he regarded as corrupt European affairs. 
> He was at once a militant nationalist, a staunch anti-communist after the [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Russian_Revolution|Russian Revolution]], 
> and deeply suspicious of the [[../../../../../../UN(United_Nations)/League_of_Nations|League of Nations]] and of the British, French, Japanese, and Russians. 
> 
> Following Hitler's rise to power, Hearst became a supporter of the Nazi Party, 
> ordering his journalists to publish favorable coverage of [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Nazi_Germany|Nazi Germany]], 
> and allowing leading Nazis to publish articles in his newspapers. 
> 
> He was a leading supporter of [[../../../../../../../Knowledge/History.internal/History~USA/US~President/Roosevelt,Franklin_Delano|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932–1934, 
> but then broke with FDR and became his most prominent enemy on the right. 
> 
> Hearst's publication reached a peak circulation of 20 million readers a day in the mid-1930s. 
> He poorly managed finances and was so deeply in debt during the [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Great_Depression|Great Depression]] 
> that most of his assets had to be liquidated in the late 1930s. 
> Hearst managed to keep his newspapers and magazines.
>
> His life story was the main inspiration for Charles Foster Kane, 
> the lead character in [[Welles,Orson]]' film [[Citizen Kane]] (1941). 
> 
> His Hearst Castle, constructed on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean near San Simeon, 
> has been preserved as a State Historical Monument and is designated as a National Historic Landmark.
