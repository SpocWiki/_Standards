## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Ministry of Truth**, the Ministry of Peace, the Ministry of Love, and the Ministry of Plenty 
> are the four ministries of the government of Oceania 
> in the 1949 dystopian novel [[Nineteen_Eighty-Four]], by [[../Orwell,George]].
>
> - The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, 
> - the Ministry of Truth with lies, 
> - the Ministry of Love with torture and 
> - the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. 
> 
> These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: 
> they are deliberate exercises in [[Doublethink]].
>
> The use of contradictory names in this manner 
> may have been inspired by the British and American governments; during the Second World War, 
> the British Ministry of Food oversaw rationing (the name "Ministry of Food Control" was used in World War I) 
> and the Ministry of Information restricted and controlled information, rather than supplying it; 
> while, in the U.S., the War Department was abolished 
> and replaced with the "National Military Establishment" in 1947 
> and then became the Department of Defense in 1949, 
> right around the time that Nineteen Eighty-Four was published.
