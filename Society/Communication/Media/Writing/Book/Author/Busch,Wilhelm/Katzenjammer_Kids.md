> The **Katzenjammer Kids** is an American comic strip created by Rudolph Dirks in 1897 
> and later drawn by Harold Knerr for 35 years (1914 to 1949). 
> 
> It debuted on December 12, 1897, in the American Humorist, 
> the Sunday supplement of [[../Hearst,William_Randolph]]'s New York Journal. 
> The comic strip was turned into a stage play in 1903. 
> It inspired several animated cartoons and was one of 20 strips 
> included in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. commemorative postage stamps.
>
> After a series of legal battles between 1912 and 1914, Dirks left the Hearst organization 
> and began a new strip, first titled Hans and Fritz and then The Captain and the Kids. 
> 
> It featured the same characters seen in The Katzenjammer Kids, which was continued by Knerr. 
> The two separate versions of the strip competed with each other until 1979, 
> when The Captain and the Kids ended its six-decade run. 
> 
> The Katzenjammer Kids published its last original strip in 2006, 
> but is still distributed in reprints by King Features Syndicate, 
> making it the oldest comic strip still in syndication and the longest-running ever.
