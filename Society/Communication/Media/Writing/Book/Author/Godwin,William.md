> **William Godwin** (3 March 1756 â€“ 7 April 1836) 
> was an English journalist, political philosopher and novelist. 
> 
> He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism 
> and the first modern proponent of anarchism. 
> 
> Godwin is most famous for two books 
> that he published within the space of a year: 
> An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, an attack on political institutions, and 
> Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams, 
> an early mystery novel which attacks aristocratic privilege. 
> 
> Based on the success of both, Godwin featured prominently 
> in the radical circles of London in the 1790s. 
> He wrote prolifically in the genres of novels, history and demography 
> throughout his life.
>
> In the conservative reaction to British radicalism, Godwin was attacked, 
> in part because of his marriage to the feminist writer [[Wollstonecraft,Mary]] in 1797 
> and his candid biography of her after her death from childbirth. 
> Their daughter, later known as Mary Shelley, would go on to write Frankenstein 
> and marry the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. 
> With his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, Godwin set up The Juvenile Library, 
> allowing the family to write their own works for children 
> (sometimes using noms de plume) and translate and publish many other books, 
> some of enduring significance. 
> Godwin has had considerable influence on British literature and literary culture.
