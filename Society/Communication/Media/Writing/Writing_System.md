> A writing system comprises a set of symbols, called a script, 
> as well as the rules by which the script represents a particular language. 
> The earliest writing appeared during the late 4th millennium BC. 
> Throughout history, each independently invented writing system 
> gradually emerged from a system of proto-writing, 
> where a small number of ideographs were used in a manner incapable of fully encoding language, 
> and thus lacking the ability to express a broad range of ideas.
>
> Writing systems are generally classified according to 
> how its symbols, called graphemes, relate to units of language. 
> 
> Phonetic writing systems – which include alphabets and syllabaries – use graphemes that correspond to sounds in the corresponding spoken language. Alphabets use graphemes called letters that generally correspond to spoken phonemes. They are typically divided into three sub-types: Pure alphabets use letters to represent both consonant and vowel sounds, abjads generally only use letters representing consonant sounds, and abugidas use letters representing consonant–vowel pairs. Syllabaries use graphemes called syllabograms that represent entire syllables or moras. By contrast, logographic (or morphographic) writing systems use graphemes that represent the units of meaning in a language, such as its words or morphemes. Alphabets typically use fewer than 100 distinct symbols, while syllabaries and logographies may use hundreds or thousands respectively.
