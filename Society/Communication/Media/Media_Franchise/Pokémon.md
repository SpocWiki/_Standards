## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pokémon** is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, 
> animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. 
> 
> The franchise takes place in a shared universe 
> in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, 
> a large variety of species endowed with special powers. 
> 
> The franchise's primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12, 
> but it is known to attract people of all ages. 
> Pokémon is estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise 
> and is one of the best-selling video game franchises.
>
> The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, 
> from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. 
> 
> Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits 
> and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. 
> From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, 
> creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". 
> 
> By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a fixture in popular culture, 
> with new products releasing to this day. 
> 
> In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, 
> an augmented reality game developed by Niantic.
>
> Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, 
> Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
> 
> Game Freak develops the core series RPGs, 
> which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, 
> while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, 
> occasionally developing spin-off titles. 
> 
> The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 
> to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. 
> 
> The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. 
> Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, 
> has managed the franchise in all regions outside Asia.
