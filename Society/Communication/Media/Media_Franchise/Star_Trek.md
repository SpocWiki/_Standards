> and became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. 
> 
> Since its creation, the franchise has expanded into various films, 
> television series, video games, novels, and comic books, 
> and it has become one of the most recognizable 
> and highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
>
> The franchise began with Star Trek (The Original Series), 
> which premiered on September 6, 1966, on Canada's CTV network. 
> 
> In the United States, it debuted on September 8, 1966, on NBC. 
> 
> The series followed the voyages of the crew of the starship USS Enterprise, 
> a space exploration vessel built by the United Federation of Planets 
> in the 23rd century, on a mission "to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before". 
> 
> In creating Star Trek, Roddenberry 
> was inspired by C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series of novels, 
> Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels, the 1956 film Forbidden Planet, 
> and television westerns such as Wagon Train.
>
> The Star Trek canon includes The Original Series, several subsequent television series, 
> and a film franchise; further adaptations also exist in expanded media. 
> 
> After the conclusion of The Original Series, 
> the adventures of its characters continued in The Animated Series, 
> and six feature films. 
> 
> A television revival beginning in the late 1980s 
> and concluding in the mid 2000s saw four spinoff series: 
> - The Next Generation, following the crew of a new starship Enterprise a century after the original series; 
> - Deep Space Nine and Voyager, both set in the same era as the Next Generation; 
> - and Enterprise, set a century before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. 
> 
> The adventures of the Next Generation crew continued in four additional feature films. 
> 
> In 2009, the film franchise underwent a reboot, creating an alternate continuity known as the Kelvin timeline; three films have been set in this continuity. 
> The most recent Star Trek revival began streaming on digital platforms in 2017 
> with series set at various points in the original continuity: Discovery (Seasons 1–2) and Strange New Worlds set before The Original Series; anthology series Short Treks; Picard, Lower Decks and Prodigy set during or after the Next Generation era; and Discovery (Seasons 3–5) and the upcoming Starfleet Academy set in the 32nd century.
