## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle 
> invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture [[../../../../../../Science/Inventor/Rubik,Ernő|Rubik,Ernő]]. 
> 
> Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik 
> to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 
> via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. 
> 
> The cube was released internationally in 1980 
> and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. 
> It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. 
> As of January 2024, around 500 million cubes had been sold worldwide, 
> making it the world's bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. 
> The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.
>
> On the original, classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, 
> with each face in one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. 
> Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead. 
> 
> Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, 
> - with white opposite yellow, 
> - blue opposite green, and 
> - orange opposite red, 
> and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order. 
> On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.
>
> An internal pivot mechanism enables each layer to turn independently, 
> thus mixing up the colours. 
> 
> For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to having only one colour. 
> The Cube has inspired other designers to create a number of similar puzzles 
> with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and mechanisms.
>
> Although the Rubik's Cube reached the height of its mainstream popularity in the 1980s, 
> it is still widely known and used. 
> 
> Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles 
> and compete for the fastest times in various categories. 
> 
> Since 2003, the World Cube Association (WCA), 
> the international governing body of the Rubik's Cube, 
> has organised competitions worldwide and has recognised world records.
