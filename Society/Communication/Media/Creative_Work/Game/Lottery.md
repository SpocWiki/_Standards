> A **Lottery** (or lotto) is a form of gambling 
> that involves the drawing of numbers at random for a prize. 
> 
> Some governments outlaw lotteries, 
> while others endorse it to the extent of organizing a national or state lottery. 
> 
> It is common to find some degree of regulation of lottery by governments. 
> The most common regulations are prohibition of sale to minors and licensing of ticket vendors. 
> Although lotteries were common in the United States and some other countries during the 19th century, 
> by the beginning of the 20th century, 
> most forms of gambling, including lotteries and sweepstakes, 
> were illegal in the U.S. and most of Europe as well as many other countries. 
> 
> This remained so until well after World War II. 
> In the 1960s, casinos and lotteries began to re-appear throughout the world 
> as a means for governments to **raise revenue without raising taxes**.
>
> Lotteries come in many formats. 
> For example, the prize can be a fixed amount of cash or goods. 
> In this format, there is risk to the organizer if insufficient tickets are sold. 
> More commonly, the prize fund will be a fixed percentage of the receipts. 
> 
> A popular form of this is the "50–50" draw, 
> where the organizers promise that the prize will be 50% of the revenue. 
> Many recent lotteries allow purchasers to select the numbers on the lottery ticket, 
> resulting in the possibility of multiple winners.
