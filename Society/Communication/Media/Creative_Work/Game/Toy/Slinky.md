> The **Slinky** is a helical spring toy invented and developed by American naval engineer Richard T. James in 1943 
> and successfully demonstrated at Gimbels department store in Philadelphia on November 27, 1945.
>
> It can perform a number of tricks, including travelling down a flight of steps end-over-end 
> as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum; 
> and appearing to levitate for a period of time after it has been dropped. 
> 
> These interesting characteristics have contributed to its success in its home country of the United States, 
> and it has inspired many popular toys with Slinky-like components, in a wide range of countries.
