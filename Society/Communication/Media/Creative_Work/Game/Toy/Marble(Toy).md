> A marble is a small spherical object often made from glass, clay, steel, plastic, or agate. 
> These toys can be used for a variety of games called marbles, 
> as well being placed in marble runs or races, or created as a form of art. 
> 
> Sizes may vary, but usually range from about 0.5 to 3.5 cm (0.2 to 1.4 in) in diameter. 
> They are often collected, both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors. 
> 
> In northern England, the game and objects are called "taws", 
> with larger marbles being called "bottle washers", 
> named after the use of a marble in Codd-neck bottles.
