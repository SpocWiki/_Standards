> **Pachisi** (pə-CHEE-zee, Hindustani: [pəˈtʃiːsiː]) is a cross and circle board game that originated in Ancient India. 
> It is described in the ancient text Mahabharata under the name of "Pasha". 
> 
> It is played on a board shaped like a symmetrical cross. 
> A player's pieces move around the board based upon a throw of six or seven cowrie shells as lots, 
> with the number of shells resting with the aperture upward indicating the number of spaces to move.
>
> The name of the game is derived from the Hindi word paccīs, meaning 'twenty-five', 
> the largest score that can be thrown with the cowrie shells; 
> thus this game is also known by the name Twenty-Five. 
> There are other versions of this game where the largest score that can be thrown is thirty.
>
> In addition to chaupar, there are many versions of the game. 
> Barjis (barsis) is popular in the Levant, mainly Syria, 
> while Parchís is another version popular in Spain and northern Morocco. 
> Parqués is its Colombian variant. 
> Parcheesi, Patchesi, Sorry!, and Ludo are among the many Westernised commercial versions of the game. 
> 
> The jeu des petits chevaux ('game of little horses') is played in France, 
> and Mensch ärgere Dich nicht is a popular German variant. 
> It is also possible that this game led to the development of the Korean board game Yunnori, through the ancient kingdom Baekje.
