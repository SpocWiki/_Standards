> Draughts (; Commonwealth English), known as **Checkers** (American English) in the United States, 
> is a group of strategy board games for two players 
> which involve forward movements of uniform game pieces 
> and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. 
> Checkers is developed from alquerque. 
> 
> The term "checkers" derives from the checkered board which the game is played on, 
> whereas "draughts" derives from the verb "to draw" or "to move".
>
> The most popular forms of checkers in Anglophone countries are 
> - American checkers (also called English draughts), which is played on an 8×8 checkerboard; 
> - Russian draughts, Turkish draughts and 
> - Armenian draughts, all of them on an 8×8 board; and 
> - international draughts, played on a 10×10 board – 
> with the latter widely played in many countries worldwide. 
> There are many other variants played on 8×8 boards. 
> Canadian checkers and Malaysian/Singaporean checkers (also locally known as dam) 
> are played on a 12×12 board.
>
> American checkers was weakly solved in 2007 
> by a team of Canadian computer scientists led by Jonathan Schaeffer. 
> From the standard starting position, perfect play by each side will result in a draw.
