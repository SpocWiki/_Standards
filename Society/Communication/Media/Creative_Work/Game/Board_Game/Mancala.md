> **Mancala** (Arabic: منقلة manqalah) is a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, marbles or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces.
>
> Versions of the game date back past the 3rd century and evidence suggests such games existed in Ancient Egypt. It is among the oldest known family of games to still be widely played today.
