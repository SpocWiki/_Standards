## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Game of chance** is in contrast with a game of skill. 
> 
> It is a game whose outcome is strongly influenced by some randomizing device.  
> 
> Common devices used include dice, spinning tops, playing cards, roulette wheels, numbered balls, or in the case of digital games random number generators. A game of chance may be played as gambling if players wager money or anything of monetary value.
>
> Alternatively, a game of skill  is one in which the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill, rather than chance.
>
> 
>
> While a game of chance may have some skill element to it, chance generally plays a greater role in determining its outcome. A game of skill may also may have elements of chance, but skill plays a greater role in determining its outcome.
>
> Gambling is known in nearly all human societies, even though many have passed laws restricting it. Early people used the knucklebones of sheep as dice.  Some people develop a psychological addiction to gambling and will risk food and shelter to continue.
