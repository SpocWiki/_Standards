## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A playing card is a piece of specially prepared card stock, heavy paper, thin cardboard, 
> plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs. 
> Often the front (face) and back of each card has a finish to make handling easier. 
> 
> They are most commonly used for playing card games, and are also used in 
> magic tricks, cardistry, card throwing, and card houses; cards may also be collected. 
> 
> Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, 
> and usually are sold together in a set as a deck of cards or pack of cards.
>
> The most common type of playing card in the West is the French-suited, standard 52-card pack, 
> of which the most widespread design is the English pattern, followed by Belgian-Genoese pattern. 
> 
> However, many countries use other, traditional types of playing card, 
> including those that are German, Italian, Spanish and Swiss-suited. 
> 
> Tarot cards (also known locally as Tarocks or tarocchi) are an old genre of playing card 
> that is still very popular in France, central and Eastern Europe and Italy. 
> Customised Tarot card decks are also used for divination; 
> including tarot card reading and cartomancy. 
> 
> Asia, too, has regional cards such as the Japanese hanafuda, 
> Chinese money-suited cards, or Indian ganjifa. 
> 
> The reverse side of the card is often covered with a pattern 
> that will make it difficult for players to look through the translucent material 
> to read other people's cards or to identify cards by minor scratches or marks on their backs.
>
> Playing cards are available in a wide variety of styles, 
> as decks may be custom-produced for competitions, casinos and magicians 
> (sometimes in the form of trick decks), made as promotional items, 
> or intended as souvenirs, artistic works, educational tools, or branded accessories. 
> 
> Decks of cards or even single cards are also collected as a hobby or for monetary value.
