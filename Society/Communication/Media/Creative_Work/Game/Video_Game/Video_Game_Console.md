## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image 
> to display a video game that can typically be played with a game controller. 
> 
> These may be home consoles, which are generally placed in a permanent location 
> connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller, 
> or handheld consoles, 
> which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit 
> and which can be played anywhere. 
> Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles.
>
> Video game consoles are a specialized form of home computer geared towards video game playing, 
> designed with affordability and accessibility to the general public in mind, 
> but lacking in raw computing power and customization. 
> 
> Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game cartridges 
> or other simplified methods of distribution, easing the effort of launching a game. 
> 
> However, this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats that create competition for market share. 
> More recent consoles have shown further confluence with home computers, 
> making it easy for developers to release games on multiple platforms. 
> 
> Further, modern consoles can serve as replacements for media players 
> with capabilities to play films and music from optical media or streaming media services.
>
> Video game consoles are usually sold on a five–seven-year cycle called a generation, 
> with consoles made with similar technical capabilities 
> or made around the same time period grouped into one generation. 
> 
> The industry has developed a razor and blades model: 
> manufacturers often sell consoles at low prices, sometimes at a loss, 
> while primarily making a profit from the licensing fees for each game sold. 
> 
> Planned obsolescence then draws consumers into buying the next console generation. 
> While numerous manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market, 
> there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market, with the current market led by 
> - Sony (with their PlayStation brand), 
> - Microsoft (with their Xbox brand), and 
> - Nintendo (currently producing the Switch 2 and Switch consoles). 
> 
> Previous console developers include Sega, Atari, Coleco, Mattel, NEC, SNK, Magnavox, Philips and Panasonic.
