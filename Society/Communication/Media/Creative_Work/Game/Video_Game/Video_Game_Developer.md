## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A video game developer is a software developer specializing in video game development 
> – the process and related disciplines of creating video games. 
> 
> A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks 
> to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, 
> such as programmers, designers, artists, etc. 
> 
> Most game development companies have 
> video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. 
> 
> Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers 
> and usually make indie games.
>
> A developer may specialize in specific game engines or specific video game consoles, or may develop for several systems (including personal computers and mobile devices). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.
>
> Most video game publishers maintain development studios (such as Electronic Arts's EA Canada, Square Enix's studios, Activision's Radical Entertainment, Nintendo EPD and Sony's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as "publishers" rather than "developers". Developers may be private as well.
