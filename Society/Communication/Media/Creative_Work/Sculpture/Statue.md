> A **Statue** is a free-standing sculpture in which the realistic, 
> full-length figures of persons or animals are carved or cast 
> in a durable material such as wood, metal or stone.  
> 
> Typical statues are life-sized or close to life-size. 
> A sculpture that represents persons or animals in full figure, 
> but that is small enough to lift and carry is a statuette or figurine, 
> whilst those that are more than twice life-size are regarded as colossal statues.
>
> Statues have been produced in many cultures from prehistory to the present; 
> the oldest-known statue dating to about 30,000 years ago.
