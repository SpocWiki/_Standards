> The Venus de Milo or Aphrodite of Melos is an ancient Greek marble sculpture 
> that was created during the Hellenistic period.  
> 
> Its exact dating is uncertain, but the modern consensus places it 
> in the 2nd century BC, perhaps between 160 and 110 BC.  
> 
> It was discovered in 1820 on the island of Milos, Greece, 
> and has been displayed at the Louvre Museum since 1821. 
> Since the statue's discovery, it has become 
> one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture in the world.
>
> The Venus de Milo is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, 
> whose Roman counterpart was Venus.  
> Made of Parian marble, the statue is larger than life size, standing over 2 metres high. 
> 
> The statue is missing both arms. 
> The original position of these missing arms is uncertain. 
> The sculpture was originally identified as depicting Aphrodite 
> holding the apple of discord as a marble hand holding an apple 
> was found alongside it; recent scientific analysis 
> supports the identification of this hand as part of the sculpture. 
> On the basis of a now-lost inscription found near the sculpture, 
> it has been attributed to Alexandros from Antioch on the Maeander, 
> though the name on the inscription is uncertain and its connection to the Venus is disputed.
>
> The Venus de Milo rapidly became a cornerstone of the Louvre's antiquities collection 
> in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and its fame spread 
> through distribution in photographs and three-dimensional copies. 
> 
> The statue inspired over 70 poems, influenced 19th-century art 
> and the Surrealist movement in the early 20th century, 
> and has been featured in various modern artistic projects, 
> including film and advertising. 
> 
> In contrast to the popular appreciation of the sculpture, scholars have been more critical. 
> Though upon its discovery the Venus was considered a classical masterpiece, 
> since it was re-dated to the Hellenistic period 
> classicists have neglected the Venus in favour of studying sculptures 
> mentioned in ancient written sources, 
> even though they only survive as later copies which are technically inferior to the Venus.
