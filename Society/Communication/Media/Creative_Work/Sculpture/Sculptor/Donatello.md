> Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi (c. 1386 – 13 December 1466), known mononymously as **Donatello**, 
> was an Italian sculptor of the Renaissance period. Born in Florence, he studied classical sculpture 
> and used his knowledge to develop an Early Renaissance style of sculpture. 
> 
> He spent time in other cities, where he worked on commissions and taught others; 
> his periods in Rome, Padua, and Siena introduced to other parts of Italy 
> the techniques he had developed in the course of a long and productive career.  
> His David was the first freestanding nude male sculpture since antiquity; 
> like much of his work, it was commissioned by the Medici family.
>
> He worked with stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco, and wax, and used glass in inventive ways. 
> He had several assistants, with four perhaps being a typical number. 
> Although his best-known works are mostly statues executed in the round, 
> he developed a new, very shallow, type of bas-relief for small works, 
> and a good deal of his output was architectural reliefs for pulpits, altars and tombs, 
> as well as Madonna and Childs for homes.
>
> Broad, overlapping, phases can be seen in his style, 
> beginning with the development of expressiveness and classical monumentality in statues, 
> then developing energy and charm, mostly in smaller works. 
> 
> Early on, he veered away from the International Gothic style he learned from Lorenzo Ghiberti, 
> with classically informed pieces, and further on a number of stark, even brutal pieces. 
> The sensuous eroticism of his most famous work, the bronze David, is very rarely seen in other pieces.
