## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An electronic document is a document that can be sent through non-physical means, 
> such as telex, email, and the internet. 
> 
> Originally, any computer data were considered as something internal—
> the final data output was always on paper. 
> 
> However, the development of computer networks has made it so that 
> in most cases it is much more convenient to distribute electronic documents than printed ones. 
> 
> The improvements in electronic visual display technologies made it possible 
> to view documents on a screen instead of printing them 
> (thus saving paper and the space required to store the printed copies). 
> 
> However, using electronic documents for the final presentation instead of paper 
> has created the problem of multiple incompatible file formats. 
> 
> Even plain text computer files are not free from this problem—
> e.g. under MS-DOS, most programs could not work correctly with UNIX-style text files, 
> and for non-English speakers, the different code pages always have been a source of trouble.
>
> Even more problems are connected with complex file formats of various 
> word processors, spreadsheets, and graphics software. 
> 
> To alleviate the problem, many software companies 
> distribute free file viewers for their proprietary file formats (e.g. Adobe's Acrobat Reader). 
> 
> The other solution is the development of standardized non-proprietary file formats 
> (such as HTML and OpenDocument), 
> and electronic documents for specialized uses have specialized formats—
> the specialized electronic articles in physics use TeX or PostScript.
