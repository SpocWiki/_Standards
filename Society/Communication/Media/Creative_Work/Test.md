> An examination (exam or evaluation) or **Test** is an educational assessment 
> intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, 
> or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs). 
> 
> A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area 
> that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills.
>
> Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. 
> There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. 
> Often, the format and difficulty of the test 
> is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, 
> policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies.
>
> A test may be administered formally or informally. 
> An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child. 
> 
> A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom 
> or an IQ test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. 
> 
> Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score. 
> A test score may be interpreted with regard to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. 
> The norm may be established independently, 
> or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.
>
> A test may be developed and administered by 
> an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider. 
> 
> In some instances, 
> the developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration. 
> 
> For example, in the United States, Educational Testing Service (ETS), 
> a nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization, 
> develops standardized tests such as the SAT 
> but may not directly be involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests.
