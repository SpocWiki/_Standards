## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In linguistics and grammar, a sentence is a linguistic expression, such as the English example 
> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." 
> 
> In traditional grammar, it is typically defined as a string of words 
> that expresses a complete thought, or as a unit consisting of a subject and predicate. 
> In non-functional linguistics it is typically defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a constituent. In functional linguistics, it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper-case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.
>
> A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, question, exclamation, request, command, or suggestion.

It is problematic that Statements are used for both: 
- expressing Facts and 
- expressing Opinions 

It would resolve so many conflicts when 2 different Forms would be used for these,
so it is easy to distinguish them and apply different procedures.
