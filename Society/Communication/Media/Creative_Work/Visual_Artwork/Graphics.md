> **Graphics** (Ancient Greek  γραφικός (التصميم) 'pertaining to drawing, painting, writing, etc.') 
> are visual images or designs on a surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, 
> to inform, illustrate, or entertain. 
> 
> In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, 
> as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, 
> and in educational and recreational software. 
> 
> Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.
>
> Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, mathematical graphs, line graphs, charts, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. 
> 
> Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. 
> Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, 
> or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. 
> 
> The objective can be clarity or effective communication, 
> association with other cultural elements, or merely the creation of a distinctive style.
>
> Graphics can be functional or artistic. 
> The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, 
> or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, 
> or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred. 
> 
> It can also be used for architecture.
