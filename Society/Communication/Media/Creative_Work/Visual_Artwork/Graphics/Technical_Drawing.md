## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of 
> composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.
>
> Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering.
>
> To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, 
> perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. 
> 
> Together, such conventions constitute a visual language 
> and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. 
> 
> Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing 
> are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.
>
> The need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document 
> distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. 
> 
> Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. 
> Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.
>
> A draftsman is a person who makes a drawing (technical or expressive). 
> A professional drafter who makes technical drawings 
> is sometimes called a drafting technician.
