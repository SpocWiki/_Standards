## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Moravec's paradox** is the observation that, as Hans Moravec wrote in 1988, 
> "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit 
> adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, 
> and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".
>
> This counterintuitive pattern may happen because skills that appear effortless to humans, 
> such as recognizing faces or walking, required millions of years of evolution to develop, 
> while abstract reasoning abilities like mathematics are evolutionarily recent.
>
> This observation was articulated in the 1980s by 
> Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and others. 
> 
> Newell presaged the idea, and characterized it as a myth of the field 
> in a 1983 chapter on the history of artificial intelligence: "a myth grew up that it was relatively easy to automate man's higher reasoning functions but very difficult to automate those functions man shared with the rest of the animal kingdom and performed well automatically, for example, recognition". 
>
> Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer 
> are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. 
> "In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best", he wrote, and added: 
> "we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well 
> than of complex ones that work flawlessly". 
> Steven Pinker wrote in 1994 that "the main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is 
> that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard".
>
> By the 2020s, in accordance with Moore's law, 
> computers were hundreds of millions of times faster than in the 1970s, 
> and the additional computer power was 
> finally sufficient to begin to handle perception and sensory skills, 
> as Moravec had predicted in 1976.  
> 
> In 2017, leading machine-learning researcher Andrew Ng presented 
> a "highly imperfect rule of thumb", that 
> "almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, 
> we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI". 
> There is currently no consensus as to which tasks AI tends to excel at.
