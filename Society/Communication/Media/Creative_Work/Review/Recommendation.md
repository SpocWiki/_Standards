[[Recommendation]] is a type of [[../Review]] that suggests or proposes something as the best option or best course of action. Recommendations may be for products or services, or other concrete things, as in the case of a ranked list or product guide. A [[../Guide]] may list multiple recommendations for different categories. For example, in a [[../Guide]] about which TVs to buy, the author may have several [[Recommendation]]s.
