> A reference work is a document, such as a paper, book or periodical 
> (or their electronic equivalents), to which one can refer for information. 
> 
> The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. 
> Such works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, 
> rather than read beginning to end. 
> 
> The writing style used in these works is informative; 
> the authors avoid opinions and the use of the first person, and emphasize facts.
>
> Indices are a common navigation feature in many types of reference works. 
> Many reference works are put together by a team of contributors 
> whose work is coordinated by one or more editors, rather than by an individual author. 
> 
> Updated editions are usually published as needed, 
> in some cases annually, such as Whitaker's Almanack, and Who's Who.
>
> Reference works include textbooks, almanacs, atlases, bibliographies, 
> biographical sources, catalogs such as library catalogs and art catalogs, 
> concordances, dictionaries, directories such as business directories and telephone directories, discographies, encyclopedias, filmographies, gazetteers, glossaries, handbooks, indices such as bibliographic indices and citation indices, manuals, research guides, thesauruses, and yearbooks. 
> 
> Reference works, while traditionally printed, are often available in electronic form 
> and can be obtained as reference software, CD-ROMs, DVDs, or online through the Internet. 
> 
> Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, is both the largest and the most-read reference work in history.
