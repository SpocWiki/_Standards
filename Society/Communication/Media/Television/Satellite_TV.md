> Satellite television is a service that delivers television programming to viewers 
> by relaying it from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location. 
> 
> The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic antenna 
> commonly referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter.
>
> A satellite receiver decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set. 
> 
> Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. 
> Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services. 
> 
> It is usually the only television available in many remote 
> geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television service. 
> 
> Different receivers are required for the two types. 
> Some transmissions and channels are unencrypted and therefore free-to-air, 
> while many other channels are transmitted with encryption. 
> 
> Free-to-view channels are encrypted but not charged-for, 
> while pay television requires the viewer to subscribe 
> and pay a monthly fee to receive the programming.
>
> Modern systems signals are relayed from a communications satellite 
> on the X band (8–12 GHz) or Ku band (12–18 GHz) frequencies, 
> requiring only a small dish less than a meter in diameter. 
> 
> The first satellite TV systems were a now-obsolete type known as television receive-only. 
> These systems received weaker analog signals transmitted in the C-band (4–8 GHz) 
> from FSS type satellites, requiring the use of large 2–3-meter dishes. 
> 
> Consequently, these systems were nicknamed "big dish" systems, 
> and were more expensive and less popular. 
> 
> Early systems used analog signals, but modern ones use digital signals, 
> which allow transmission of the modern television standard high-definition television, 
> due to the significantly improved spectral efficiency of digital broadcasting. 
> 
> As of 2022, Star One D2 from Brazil is the only remaining satellite broadcasting in analog signals.
