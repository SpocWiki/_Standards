## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Meet the Press is a weekly American television Sunday morning talk show broadcast on NBC. 
> It is the longest-running program on American television, 
> though its format has changed since the debut episode on November 6, 1947. 
> 
> Meet the Press specializes in interviews with leaders in Washington, D.C., 
> across the country, and around the world 
> on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy, and other public affairs, 
> along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. 
> In January 2021, production moved to NBC's bureau on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.
>
> The longevity of Meet the Press is attributable in part to the fact that the program debuted during what was only the second official "network television season" for American television. 
> It was the first live television network news program 
> on which a sitting president of the United States appeared, 
> this occurred on its broadcast on November 9, 1975, which featured Gerald Ford. 
> 
> The program has been hosted by 12 moderators, beginning with creator Martha Rountree. 
> The show's current moderator is Kristen Welker, who became moderator in September 2023 
> following longtime moderator Chuck Todd's departure.
>
> Meet the Press airs Sundays from 9:00 a.m.–10:00 a.m. ET on NBC, 10:30 a.m.–11:30 a.m. ET in New York and Washington. Meet the Press is also occasionally pre-empted by network coverage of sports events held outside the U.S. The program is syndicated by Westwood One to various radio stations around the United States, and is on C-SPAN Radio as part of its replays of the Sunday morning talk shows.
