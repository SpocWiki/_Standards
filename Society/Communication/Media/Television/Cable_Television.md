> Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to consumers 
> via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables, 
> or in more recent systems, light pulses through fibre-optic cables. 
> 
> This contrasts with broadcast television, 
> in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air by radio waves 
> and received by a television antenna, or satellite television, 
> in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air 
> by radio waves from a communications satellite and received by a satellite dish on the roof. 
> 
> FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, 
> and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. 
> Analog television was standard in the 20th century, 
> but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.
>
> A cable channel (sometimes known as a cable network) 
> is a television network available via cable television.  
> 
> Many of the same channels are distributed through satellite television.  
> Alternative terms include non-broadcast channel or programming service, 
> the latter being mainly used in legal contexts. 
> The abbreviation CATV is used in the US for cable television 
> and originally stood for community antenna television, from cable television's origins in 1948; 
> in areas where over-the-air TV reception was limited 
> by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, 
> large community antennas were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.
>
> In 1968, 6.4% of Americans had cable television. 
> The number increased to 7.5% in 1978. 
> By 1988, 52.8% of all households were using cable. 
> The number further increased to 62.4% in 1994.
