> A television show, TV program (British English: programme), or simply a TV show, 
> is the general reference to any content produced for viewing on a television set 
> that is transmitted via over-the-air, satellite, and cable, or distributed digitally on streaming platforms. 
> 
> This generally excludes breaking news or advertisements that are aired between shows or between segments of a show. 
> A regularly recurring show is called a television series, and an individual segment of such a series is called an episode. 
> 
> Content is produced either in-house on a television stage with multiple cameras 
> or produced by contract with film production companies. 
> 
> Episodes are usually broadcast in annual sets, which are called seasons in North America and series in other regions. 
> A one-off television show may be called a television special, 
> while a show with a limited number of episodes is a miniseries.  
> A television film, or telefilm, is a feature film produced for broadcast by a terrestrial or cable network.
>
> Television shows by terrestrial and cable networks are most often scheduled for broadcast ahead of time 
> and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings. 
> 
> The rise of streaming television, however, has made television schedules less relevant than in earlier decades. 
> 
> Some programming may be aired live—that is, events are broadcast at the time they happen rather than at a later time or date—
> but the vast majority of programming is produced ahead of time. 
> 
> Originally, viewers had no practical way to record a show for later viewing; 
> this changed with the advent of home video, first in the form of videotape recorded on VCRs 
> and later in the form of digital video recorders. 
> 
> Cable television providers began offering certain programming "pay-per-view" or on-demand, 
> with viewers paying a one-time fee to watch a program at a time of their own choosing. 
> Streaming television allows viewers to watch programming at any time with a subscription to the service.
