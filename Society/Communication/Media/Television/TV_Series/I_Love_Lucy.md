> I Love Lucy is an American sitcom that aired on CBS from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, 
> with 180 half-hour episodes across six seasons. 
> 
> The series starred Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, 
> along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley, 
> and follows the life of Lucy Ricardo (Ball), a young, middle-class housewife living in New York City, 
> who often concocts plans with her best friends and landlords, Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vance and Frawley), 
> to appear alongside her bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (Arnaz), in his nightclub. 
> 
> Lucy is depicted trying numerous schemes to mingle with and be a part of show business. 
> After the series ended in 1957, a modified version of the show continued for three more seasons, 
> with 13 one-hour specials, which ran from 1957 to 1960. 
> It was first known as The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show, 
> and later, in reruns, as The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour.
>
> I Love Lucy became the most-watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons 
> and it was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings. 
> As of 2011, episodes of the show have been syndicated in dozens of languages across the world 
> and remain popular with an American audience of 40 million each year. 
> A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than eight million viewers 
> when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013, 62 years after the show premiered.
>

> in front of a studio audience, by cinematographer Karl Freund – 
> won five Emmy Awards and received many nominations and honors. 
>
