> Edward Vincent Sullivan (September 28, 1901 â€“ October 13, 1974) 
> was an American television host, impresario, sports and entertainment reporter, 
> and syndicated columnist for the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune. 
> 
> He was the creator and host of the television variety program Toast of the Town, 
> which in 1955 was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. 
> Broadcast from 1948 to 1971, 
> it set a record as the longest-running variety show in U.S. broadcast history. 
> "It was, by almost any measure, the last great American TV show", 
> said television critic David Hinckley. 
> "It's one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories."
>
> Sullivan was a broadcasting pioneer during the early years of American television. 
> As critic David Bianculli wrote, "Before MTV, Sullivan presented rock acts. 
> Before Bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. 
> Before the Comedy Channel, even before there was The Tonight Show, 
> Sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. 
> Before there were 500 channels, before there was cable, Ed Sullivan was where the choice was. 
> From the start, he was indeed 'the Toast of the Town'." 
> 
> In 1996, Sullivan was ranked number 50 on TV Guide's "50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time".
