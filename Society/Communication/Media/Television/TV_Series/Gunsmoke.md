> **Gunsmoke** is an American radio and television Western drama series 
> created by director Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston. 
> It centered on Dodge City, Kansas, in the 1870s, during the settlement of the American West. 
> The central character is lawman Marshal Matt Dillon, 
> played by William Conrad on radio and James Arness on television.
>
> The radio series ran from 1952 to 1961. John Dunning wrote that, among radio drama enthusiasts, 
> "Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time." 
> It ran unsponsored for its first few years, with CBS funding its production.
>
> In 1955, the series was adapted for television and ran for 20 seasons. 
> It ran for half-hour episodes from 1955 to 1961, and one-hour episodes from 1961 to 1975.  
> A total of 635 episodes were aired over its 20 year run, 
> making it the longest-running scripted American primetime television series 
> until being surpassed in episodes by The Simpsons. 
> 
> At the end of its run in 1975, Los Angeles Times columnist Cecil Smith wrote: 
> "Gunsmoke was the dramatization of the American epic legend of the west. 
> Our own Iliad and Odyssey, created from standard elements of the dime novel 
> and the pulp Western as romanticized by Buntline, Harte, and Twain. 
> It was ever the stuff of legend."
>
> Five made-for-TV movies were produced after its 20-year run. 
> The show won 15 Primetime Emmy Awards as well as other accolades.  
> It was frequently well received, holding a top-10 spot in the Nielsen ratings for several seasons.
>
> In the United Kingdom, the series was initially titled Gun Law.
