> Dame Margaret Evelyn de Arias DBE (née Hookham; 18 May 1919 – 21 February 1991), 
> known by the stage name Margot Fonteyn, was an English ballerina. 
> She spent her entire career as a dancer with the Royal Ballet 
> (formerly the Sadler's Wells Theatre Company), 
> eventually being appointed prima ballerina assoluta of the company by Queen Elizabeth II.
>
> Beginning ballet lessons at the age of four, she studied in England and China, 
> where her father was transferred for his work. 
> Her training in Shanghai was with Russian expatriate dancer Georgy Goncharov, 
> contributing to her continuing interest in Russian ballet. 
> 
> Returning to London at the age of 14, she was invited to join the Vic-Wells Ballet School 
> by Ninette de Valois. 
> She succeeded Alicia Markova as prima ballerina of the company in 1935. 
> The Vic-Wells choreographer, Sir Frederick Ashton, 
> wrote numerous parts for Fonteyn and her partner, Robert Helpmann, 
> with whom she danced from the 1930s to the 1940s.
>
> In 1946, the company, now renamed the Sadler's Wells Ballet, 
> moved into the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden 
> where Fonteyn's most frequent partner throughout the next decade 
> was Michael Somes. 
> 
> Her performance in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty became a distinguishing role 
> for both Fonteyn and the company, but she was also well known for 
> the ballets created by Ashton, including Symphonic Variations, Cinderella, Daphnis 
> and Chloe, Ondine and Sylvia.
>
> In 1949, she led the company in a tour of the United States 
> and became an international celebrity. 
> 
> Before and after the Second World War, Fonteyn performed in televised broadcasts 
> of ballet performances in Britain 
> and in the early 1950s appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, 
> consequently increasing the popularity of dance in the United States.
>
> In 1955, she married the Panamanian politician Roberto Arias 
> and appeared in a live colour production of The Sleeping Beauty aired on NBC. 
> Three years later, she and Somes danced 
> for the BBC television adaptation of The Nutcracker. 
> Thanks to her international acclaim and many guest artist requests, 
> the Royal Ballet allowed Fonteyn to become a freelance dancer in 1959.
>
> In 1961, when Fonteyn was considering retirement, 
> Rudolf Nureyev defected from the Kirov Ballet while dancing in Paris. 
> 
> Fonteyn, though reluctant to partner with him because of their 19-year age difference, 
> danced with him in his début with the Royal Ballet in Giselle on 21 February 1962. 
> The duo immediately became an international sensation, 
> each dancer pushing the other to their best performances. 
> 
> They were most noted for their classical performances in works such as 
> Le Corsaire Pas de Deux, Les Sylphides, La Bayadère, Swan Lake, and Raymonda, 
> in which Nureyev sometimes adapted choreographies specifically to showcase their talents. 
> 
> The pair premièred Ashton's Marguerite and Armand, 
> which had been choreographed specifically for them, 
> and were noted for their performance in the title roles of Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet.
>
> The following year, Fonteyn's husband was shot during an assassination attempt 
> and became a quadriplegic, requiring constant care for the remainder of his life. 
> 
> In 1972, Fonteyn went into semi-retirement, 
> although she continued to dance periodically until the end of the decade. 
> 
> In 1979, she was fêted by the Royal Ballet 
> and officially pronounced the prima ballerina assoluta of the company. 
> 
> She retired to Panama, where she spent her time writing books, raising cattle, 
> and caring for her husband. 
> She died from ovarian cancer exactly 29 years after her premiere with Nureyev in Giselle.
