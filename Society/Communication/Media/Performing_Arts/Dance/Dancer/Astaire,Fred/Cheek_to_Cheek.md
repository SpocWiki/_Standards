[Chorus]  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak  
And I seem to find the happiness I seek  
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven, I'm in heaven  
And the cares that hung around me through the week  
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak  
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek  
  
[Verse 1]  
Oh, I love to climb a mountain  
And to reach the highest peak  
But it doesn't thrill me half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh, I love to go out fishing  
In a river or a creek  
But I don't enjoy it half as much  
As dancing cheek to cheek  
  
[Bridge]  
Dance with me  
I want my arm about you  
The charm about you  
Will carry me through to Heaven
