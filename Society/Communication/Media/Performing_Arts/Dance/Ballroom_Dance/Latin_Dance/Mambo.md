## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Mambo is a Latin dance of Cuba which was developed in the 1940s 
> when the music genre of the same name became popular throughout Latin America. 
> 
> The original ballroom dance which emerged in Cuba and Mexico 
> was related to the danzón, albeit faster and less rigid. 
> 
> In the United States, it replaced rhumba as the most fashionable Latin dance. 
> 
> Later on, with the advent of salsa and its more sophisticated dance, 
> a new type of **Mambo (dance)** including breaking steps was popularized in New York. 
> 
> This form received the name of "salsa on 2", "mambo on 2" or "modern mambo".
