## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Jitterbug** is a generalized term used to describe swing dancing. 
> It is often synonymous with the lindy hop dance but might include elements of the jive, 
> east coast swing, collegiate shag, charleston, balboa and other swing dances.
>
> Swing dancing originated in the African-American communities of New York City in the early 20th century. 
> Many nightclubs had a whites-only or blacks-only policy due to racial segregation, 
> however the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem had a no-discrimination policy 
> which allowed whites and blacks to dance together 
> and it was there that the Lindy Hop dance flourished, 
> started by dancers such as George Snowden and Frank Manning. 
> 
> The term jitterbug was originally a ridicule used by black patrons 
> to describe whites who started to dance the Lindy Hop, 
> as they were dancing faster and jumpier than was intended, like "jittering bugs", 
> although it quickly lost its negative connotation as the more erratic version caught on. 
> 
> Both the Lindy Hop and the "jitterbug" became popular outside Harlem 
> when the dance was featured in Hollywood films and Broadway theatre, 
> starring the performance group Whitey's Lindy Hoppers.
