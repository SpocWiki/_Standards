> The jive is a dance style that originated in the United States from African Americans in the early 1930s. 
> The name of the dance comes from the name of a form of African-American vernacular slang, 
> popularized in the 1930s by the publication of a dictionary by Cab Calloway, 
> the famous jazz bandleader and singer. 
> 
> In competition ballroom dancing, 
> the jive is often (mistakenly) grouped with the Latin-inspired ballroom dances, 
> though its roots are based more on swing dancing than Latin dancing.
