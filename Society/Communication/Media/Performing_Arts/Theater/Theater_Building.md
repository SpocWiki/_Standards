> A theater, theatre or playhouse, is a structure where theatrical works, performing arts, and musical concerts are presented. 
> 
> The theater building serves to define the performance and audience spaces. 
> The facility usually is organized to provide support areas for performers, 
> the technical crew and the audience members, 
> as well as the stage where the performance takes place.
>
> There are as many types of theaters as there are types of performance. 
> Theaters may be built specifically for certain types of productions, 
> they may serve for more general performance needs 
> or they may be adapted or converted for use as a theater. 
> 
> They may range from open-air amphitheaters to ornate, cathedral-like structures 
> to simple, undecorated rooms or black box theaters. 
> 
> A thrust stage as well as an arena stage 
> are just a few more examples of the multitude of stages where plays can occur. 
> 
> A theatre used for opera performances is called an opera house. 
> A theater is not required for performance (as in environmental theater or street theater), 
> this article is about structures used specifically for performance. 
> 
> Some theaters may have a fixed acting area (in most theaters this is known as the stage), 
> while some theaters, such as black box theaters have movable seating 
> allowing the production to create a performance area suitable for the production.
