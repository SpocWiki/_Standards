> **Noh** (能, Nō; Japanese pronunciation: [no(ꜜ)ː], Sino-Japanese for "ability") is a major form of 
> classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century. 
> 
> It is Japan's oldest major theater art that is still regularly performed today. 
> Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature 
> featuring a supernatural being transformed into a human hero who narrates the story. 
> 
> Noh integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, 
> requiring highly trained actors and musicians. 
> 
> Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures 
> while the iconic masks represent specific roles such as ghosts, women, deities, and demons. 
> 
> Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, 
> Noh is highly codified and regulated by the iemoto system.
>
> Although the terms Noh and nōgaku are sometimes used interchangeably, nōgaku encompasses both Noh and kyōgen. Traditionally, a full nōgaku program included several Noh plays with comedic kyōgen plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one kyōgen piece has become common today.
