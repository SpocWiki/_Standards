> Commedia dell'arte was an early form of professional theatre, originating from Italian theatre, 
> that was popular throughout Europe between the 16th and 18th centuries. 
> It was formerly called Italian comedy in English and is also known as commedia alla maschera, 
> commedia improvviso, and commedia dell'arte all'improvviso. 
> 
> Commedia is characterized by masked "types" which are standardised archetypical characters 
> shared across all productions and identified via their names, costumes, and functions in the comedy.
>
> Commedia was responsible for the rise of actresses such as Isabella Andreini 
> and improvised performances based on sketches or scenarios. 
> 
> A commedia, such as The Tooth Puller, contains both scripted and improvised portions; 
> key plot points and characters' entrances and exits are scripted, 
> but the actors may otherwise be expected to improvise new gags on stage. 
> 
> A special characteristic of commedia is the lazzo, a joke or "something foolish or witty", 
> usually well known to the performers and to some extent a scripted routine. 
> Another characteristic of commedia is pantomime, 
> which is mostly used by the character Arlecchino, now better known as Harlequin.
>
> The characters of the commedia usually represent fixed social types and stock characters, 
> such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. 
> The characters are exaggerated "real characters", such as a know-it-all doctor called il Dottore, 
> a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the innamorati. 
> 
> Many troupes were formed to perform commedia, including 
> - I Gelosi (which had actors such as Isabella Andreini and her husband Francesco Andreini), 
> - Confidenti Troupe, 
> - Desioi Troupe, and 
> - Fedeli Troupe. 
> Commedia was often performed outside on platforms or in popular areas such as a piazza (town square). 
> The form of theatre originated in Italy, but travelled throughout Europe—sometimes to as far away as Moscow.
>
> The genesis of commedia may be related to Carnival in Venice, 
> where the author and actor Andrea Calmo had created the character Il Magnifico, 
> the precursor to the vecchio (meaning 'old one' or simply 'old') Pantalone, by 1570. 
> 
> In the Flaminio Scala scenario, for example, Il Magnifico persists 
> and is interchangeable with Pantalone into the 17th century. 
> 
> While Calmo's characters (which also included the Spanish Capitano and a il Dottore type) were not masked, 
> it is uncertain at what point the characters donned the mask. 
> 
> However, the connection to Carnival (the period between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday) would suggest 
> that masking was a convention of Carnival and was applied at some point. 
> The tradition in northern Italy is centred in Florence, Mantua, and Venice, 
> where the major companies came under the protection of the various dukes. 
> 
> Concomitantly, a Neapolitan tradition emerged in the south 
> and featured the prominent stage figure Pulcinella, 
> which has been long associated with Naples and derived into various types elsewhere—
> most famously as the puppet character Punch (of the eponymous Punch and Judy shows) in England.
