> Richard Douglas Fosbury (March 6, 1947 â€“ March 12, 2023) was an American high jumper, 
> who is considered one of the most influential athletes in the history of track and field. 
> 
> He won a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics, 
> revolutionizing the high jump event with a "back-first" technique 
> now known as the Fosbury flop. 
> 
> His method was to sprint diagonally towards the bar, 
> then curve and leap backward over the bar, 
> which gave him a much lower center of mass in flight than traditional techniques. 
> 
> Debbie Brill was developing her similar "Brill Bend" around the same time. 
> This approach has seen nearly universal adoption since Fosbury's performance in Mexico. 
> Though he never returned to the Olympics, 
> Fosbury continued to be involved in athletics after retirement 
> and served on the executive board of the World Olympians Association.
>
> In 2014, Fosbury challenged Steve Miller for a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives, but was unsuccessful. Fosbury ran for Blaine County Commissioner against incumbent Larry Schoen in 2018, won the seat, and took office in 2019.
