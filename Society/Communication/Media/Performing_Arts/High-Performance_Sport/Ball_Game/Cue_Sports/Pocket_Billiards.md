## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Pool is a series of cue sports played on a billiard table. 
> The table has six pockets along the rails, into which balls are shot. 
> 
> Of the many different pool games, the most popular include: 
> eight-ball, blackball, nine-ball, ten-ball, seven-ball, straight pool, one-pocket, and bank pool. 
> Eight-ball is the most frequently played discipline of pool, 
> and it is often thought of as synonymous with "pool".
>
> The generic term **Pocket billiards** is sometimes also used, and favored by some pool-industry bodies, but is technically a broader classification, including games such as snooker, Russian pyramid, and kaisa, which are not referred to as pool games. There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, bottle pool, cowboy pool, and English billiards.
