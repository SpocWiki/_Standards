## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Cue sports are a wide variety of games of skill played with a cue stick, 
> which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to  
> move around a cloth-covered table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions. 
> 
> Cue sports, a category of stick sports, may collectively be referred to as billiards, 
> though this term has more specific connotations in some English dialects.
>
> There are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports:
>
> Carom billiards, played on tables without pockets, typically ten feet in length, including straight rail, balkline, one-cushion carom, three-cushion billiards, artistic billiards, and four-ball
>
> Pocket billiards (or pool), played on six-pocket tables of seven, eight, nine, or ten-foot length, including among others eight-ball (the world's most widely played cue sport), nine-ball (the dominant professional game), ten-ball, straight pool (the formerly dominant pro game), one-pocket, and bank pool
>
> Snooker, English billiards, and Russian pyramid, played on a large, six-pocket table (dimensions just under 12 ft by 6 ft), all of which are classified separately from pool based on distinct development histories, player culture, rules, and terminology.
