> A **Ball** is a round object (usually spherical, but sometimes ovoid) with several uses. 
> It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, 
> kicked or thrown by players. 
> 
> Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling. 
> Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications 
> to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. 
> 
> Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.
>
> Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, 
> this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus. 
> 
> The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) 
> which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame. 
> 
> Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus 
> were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.
>
> As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, 
> the word "ball" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects.
>
> "Ball" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, 
> e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, or making a fist into a ball.
