> In sports, **Racing** is a competition of speed, 
> in which competitors try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. 
> 
> Typically this involves traversing some distance, 
> but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.
>
> A race may be run continuously to finish or may be made up of several segments called heats, stages or legs. 
> A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. 
> A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a time trial.
>
> Early records of races are evident on pottery from ancient Greece, 
> which depicted running men vying for first place. 
> 
> A chariot race is described in Homer's Iliad.
