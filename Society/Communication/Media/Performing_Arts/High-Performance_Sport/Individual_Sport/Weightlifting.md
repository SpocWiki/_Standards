## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Weightlifting** or weight lifting generally refers to physical exercises and sports 
> in which people lift weights, often in the form of dumbbells, barbells or machines. 
> 
> People engage in weightlifting for a variety of different reasons. 
> These can include: developing physical strength; promoting health and fitness; competing in weightlifting sports; and developing a muscular and aesthetic physique.
>
> Olympic weightlifting is a specific type of weightlifting sport practiced at the Olympic Games, commonly referred to simply as "weightlifting". Other weightlifting sports include stone lifting, powerlifting, kettlebell lifting, and para powerlifting—the weightlifting sport practiced at the Paralympic Games. Different weightlifting sports may be distinguished by the different ways of lifting a weight, and/or the objects lifted. Weightlifting events are key elements of strength athletics.
>
> Weight training is weightlifting to develop physical strength and/or a muscular physique. It is a common part of strength conditioning for athletes in many sports. When the primary goal is to develop an all-round muscular physique, this is bodybuilding. People who train with weights utilize both free weights (such as barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells) and weight machines to train all parts of their bodies. A place and equipment for weight training is provided at gyms and leisure centres.
>
> According to an article in The New York Times, lifting weights can prevent some disabilities, increase metabolism, and lower body fat. Using free weights, compared to machines, improves not only strength but muscle function as well, in high-functioning older adults.
