## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Darts** is a competitive sport in which two or more players 
> bare-handedly throw small sharp-pointed projectiles known as darts 
> at a round target known as a dartboard.
>
> Points can be scored by hitting specific marked areas of the board, 
> though unlike in sports such as archery, these areas are distributed all across the board 
> and do not follow a principle of points increasing toward the board's bullseye. 
> 
> Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, 
> the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game 
> involving a specific board design and set of rules.
>
> Darts is both a professional throwing sport and a traditional pub game.  
> Darts is commonly played in the British Isles, and recreationally enjoyed around the world.
