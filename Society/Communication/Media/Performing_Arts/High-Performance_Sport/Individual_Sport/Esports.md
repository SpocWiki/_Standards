> **Esports**, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. 
> Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, 
> particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams.
>
> Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, 
> but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s 
> when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, 
> enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators. 
> By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, 
> with many game developers designing for and funding tournaments and other events.
>
> Esports first became popular in East Asia, particularly in China and South Korea 
> (which first licensed professional players in 2000) but less so in Japan, 
> whose broad anti-gambling laws prohibit professional gaming tournaments. 
> Esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, which host regional and international events.
>
> The most common video game genres associated with esports are 
> - multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), 
> - first-person shooter (FPS), 
> - fighting games, 
> - card, 
> - battle royales, and 
> - real-time strategy (RTS) games. 
> 
> Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft. Among the most popular tournaments are the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia. The International Olympic Committee has discussed their inclusion in future Olympic events, starting with the Olympic Esports Games set to be held in 2027.
