## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Saddle** is a supportive structure for a rider of an animal, 
> fastened to an animal's back by a girth. 
> 
> The most common type is equestrian. 
> 
> However, specialized saddles have been created for oxen, camels and other animals. 
> The trade of making saddles is saddlery.
>
> It is not known precisely when riders first began to use some sort of padding or protection, 
> but a blanket attached by some form of surcingle or girth was probably the first "saddle", 
> followed later by more elaborate padded designs. 
> 
> The solid saddle tree was a later invention, 
> and though early stirrup designs predated the invention of the solid tree, 
> the paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle 
> to reach the basic form that is still used today. 
> 
> Present-day saddles come in a wide variety of styles
> , each designed for a specific equestrianism discipline, 
> and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse. 
> 
> Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades. 
> The saddle was a crucial step in the increased use of domesticated animals, 
> during the Classical Era.
