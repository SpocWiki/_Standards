> Horse racing is an equestrian performance activity, 
> typically involving two or more horses ridden by jockeys 
> (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. 
> 
> It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise – 
> to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – 
> has been mostly unchanged since at least classical antiquity.
>
> Horse races vary widely in format, 
> and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. 
> Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, 
> running over different distances, running on different track surfaces, and running in different gaits. In some races, horses are assigned different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.
>
> While horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.
