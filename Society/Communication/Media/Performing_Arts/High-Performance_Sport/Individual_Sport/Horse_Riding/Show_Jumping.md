## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Show jumping is a part of a group of English riding equestrian events 
> that also includes eventing, hunters, and equitation. 
> 
> Jumping classes are commonly seen at horse shows throughout the world, 
> including the Olympics. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers. Sometimes jumper classes are offered in conjunction with other English-style events. Sometimes, show jumping is but one division of a very large, all-breed competition that includes a very wide variety of disciplines. Jumping classes may be governed by various national horse show sanctioning organizations, such as the United States Equestrian Federation or the British Showjumping Association.  International competitions are governed by the rules of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.
