## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dressage** ( or ; French: [dʁɛsaʒ], most commonly translated as "training") 
> is a form of horse riding performed in exhibition and competition, 
> as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. 
> 
> As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation, 
> dressage is described as "the highest expression of horse training" 
> where "horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements".
>
> Competitions are held at all levels from amateur to the Olympic Games and World Equestrian Games. 
> Its fundamental purpose is to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, 
> a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse. 
> At the peak of a dressage horse's gymnastic development, 
> the horse responds smoothly to a skilled rider's minimal aids. 
> The rider is relaxed and appears effort-free while the horse willingly performs the requested movement.
>
> The discipline has a rich history with ancient roots in the writings of Xenophon. 
> Modern dressage has evolved as an important equestrian pursuit since the Renaissance 
> when Federico Grisone's "The Rules of Riding" was published in 1550, 
> one of the first notable European treatises on equitation since Xenophon's On Horsemanship. 
> Much about training systems used today reflects practices of classical dressage.
>
> In modern dressage competition, successful training at the various levels 
> is demonstrated through the performance of "tests", 
> prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena. 
> 
> Judges evaluate each movement on the basis of a standard appropriate to the level of the test 
> and assign each movement a score from zero to ten – zero being "not executed" and 10 being "excellent". 
> A competitor achieving all 6s (or 60% overall) might typically then move up to the next level.
