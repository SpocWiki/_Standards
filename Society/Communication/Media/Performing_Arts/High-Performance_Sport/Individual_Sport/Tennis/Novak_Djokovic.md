## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Novak Djokovic (born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. 
> He has been ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles 
> by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for a record 428 weeks, 
> and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times 
> and has been ranked No. 1 at least once in a year for a record 13 different years. 
> 
> Djokovic has won 100 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including a record 24 majors, 
> a record 10 Australian Open titles, a record 40 Masters, a record seven year-end championships, 
> and an Olympic gold medal. 
> 
> Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once 
> across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, 
> and the only player to complete a Career Golden Masters, a feat he has accomplished twice. 
> Djokovic is the only player in singles to have won all of the Big Titles over the course of his career.
>
> Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. 
> In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors 
> by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. 
> By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field 
> and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was referred to as the "Big Three" 
> among fans and commentators. 
> 
> In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors 
> and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. 
> He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade. 
> 
> Djokovic had his most successful season in 2015, reaching a record 15 consecutive finals 
> and winning a record 10 Big Titles while earning a record 31 victories over top 10 players. 
> His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, 
> where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, 
> becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously 
> and setting a rankings points record of 16,950.
>
> In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened his results 
> until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where he won the title 
> while ranked No. 21 in the world. 
> 
> Djokovic then returned to a dominant status, winning 12 major titles 
> and completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. 
> Due to his opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine, he was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022, 
> notably the Australian Open and the US Open, 
> being deported from the country in the former case. 
> 
> One year after the Australian visa controversy, 
> he made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy, 
> and shortly after claimed the all-time record for most men's singles majors titles. 
> In 2024, he became the only player to complete a career sweep of the Big Titles.
>
> Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, 
> and the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. 
> 
> In singles, he won the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics 
> and the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
> He is a recipient of the Order of Karađorđe Star, Order of St. Sava, 
> and the Order of the Republika Srpska. 
> He has been named the BTA Best Balkan Athlete of the Year a record eight times.
>
> Beyond competition, Djokovic was elected as the president of the ATP Player Council in 2016. 
> He stepped down in 2020 to front a new player-only tennis association; 
> the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) founded by him and Vasek Pospisil, 
> citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour 
> and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players. 
> 
> Djokovic is an active philanthropist. 
> He is the founder of Novak Djokovic Foundation, 
> which is committed to supporting children from disadvantaged communities. 
> Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015.
