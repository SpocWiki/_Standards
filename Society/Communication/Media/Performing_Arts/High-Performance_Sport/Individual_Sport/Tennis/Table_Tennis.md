> Table tennis (also known as ping-pong) is a racket sport derived from tennis 
> but distinguished by its playing surface being atop a stationary table, 
> rather than the court on which players stand. 
> 
> Either individually or in teams of two, players take alternating turns 
> returning a light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing half of the court 
> using small rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point for the opponent. 
> 
> Play is fast, requiring quick reaction and constant attention, 
> and is characterized by an emphasis on spin, 
> which can affect the ball's trajectory more than in other ball sports.
>
> Owed to its small minimum playing area, its ability to be played indoors in all climates, 
> and relative accessibility of equipment, table tennis is enjoyed worldwide not just as a competitive sport, 
> but as a common recreational pastime among players of all levels and ages.
>
> Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, 
> with event categories in both men's and women's singles, 
> and men's and women's teams since replacing doubles in 2008.
>
> Table tennis is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926, 
> and specifies the official rules in the ITTF handbook. 
> 
> ITTF currently includes 226 member associations worldwide.
