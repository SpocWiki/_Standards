> Tenpin bowling is a type of bowling in which a bowler rolls a bowling ball 
> down a wood or synthetic lane toward ten pins positioned evenly in four rows 
> in an equilateral triangle. 
> 
> The goal is to knock down all ten pins on the first roll of the ball (a strike), 
> or failing that, on the second roll (a spare). 
> 
> While most people approach modern tenpin bowling as a simple recreational pastime, 
> those who bowl competitively, especially at the highest levels, 
> consider it a demanding sport requiring precision and skill.
>
> An approximately 15-foot (5 m) long approach area used by the bowler 
> to impart speed and apply rotation to the ball ends in a foul line. 
> 
> The 41.5-inch-wide (105 cm), 60-foot-long (18 m) lane is bordered along its length 
> by gutters (channels) that collect errant balls. 
> The lane's long and narrow shape limits straight-line ball paths 
> to angles that are smaller than optimum angles for achieving strikes; 
> accordingly, bowlers impart side rotation to hook (curve) the ball into the pins 
> to increase the likelihood of striking.
>
> Oil is applied to approximately the first two-thirds of the lane's length 
> to allow a "skid" area for the ball before it encounters friction and hooks. 
> The oil is applied in different lengths and layout patterns, 
> especially in professional and tournament play, to add complexity 
> and regulate challenge in the sport. 
> 
> Especially when coupled with technological developments in ball design since the early 1990s, 
> easier oil patterns common for league bowling 
> enable many league bowlers to achieve scores rivaling those of professional bowlers 
> who must bowl on more difficult patterns—a development that has caused substantial controversy.
>
> Tenpin bowling arose in the early 1800s as an alternative to nine-pin bowling, with truly standardized regulations not being agreed on until nearly the end of that century. After the development of automated mechanical pinsetters, the sport enjoyed a "golden age" in the mid twentieth century. Following substantial declines since the 1980s in both professional tournament television ratings and amateur league participation, bowling centers have increasingly expanded to become diverse entertainment centers.
>
> Tenpin bowling is often simply referred to as bowling. Tenpin, or less commonly big-ball, is prepended in the English-speaking world to distinguish it from other bowling types such as bowls, candlepin, duckpin and five-pin.
