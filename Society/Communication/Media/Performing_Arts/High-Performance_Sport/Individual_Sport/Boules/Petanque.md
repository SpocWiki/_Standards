> Pétanque (French: [petɑ̃k] , locally in Provence [peˈtãᵑkə]; 
> Occitan: petanca [peˈtaŋkɔ] ; Catalan: petanca [pəˈtaŋkə, peˈtaŋka]) 
> is a sport that falls into the category of boules sports 
> (along with raffa, bocce, boule lyonnaise, lawn bowls, and crown green bowling). 
> In these sports, players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball.
>
> In pétanque, the objective is to score points by positioning one's boules closer to the target ball 
> than those of the opponent after all boules have been thrown. 
> 
> This is achieved by throwing or rolling boules closer to the small target ball, 
> officially called a jack (French: cochonnet), 
> or by hitting the opponents' boules away from the target, 
> while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground. 
> 
> The game is normally and best played on hard dirt or gravel. 
> It can be played in public areas in parks or in dedicated facilities called boulodromes.
>
> The current form of the game was codified in 1907 or 1910 in La Ciotat, in Provence, France. 
> The French name pétanque (borrowed into English, with or without the acute accent) 
> comes from petanca in the Provençal dialect of the Occitan language, 
> deriving from the expression pè tancat [ˈpɛ taŋˈkat], meaning 'foot fixed' or 'foot planted' (on the ground).
