> The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, LLC (**NASCAR**) 
> is an American auto racing sanctioning and operating company 
> that is best known for stock car racing. 
> 
> It is considered to be one of the top-ranked motorsports organizations in the world 
> and is one of the largest spectator sports leagues in America. 
> 
> The privately owned company was founded by Bill France Sr. in 1948, 
> and his son, Jim France, has been the CEO since August 2018. 
> 
> The company is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. 
> Each year, NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 48 US states, 
> as well as in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and Europe.
>
> NASCAR, and stock car racing as a whole, 
> traces its roots back to moonshine runners during Prohibition, 
> who grew to compete against each other in a show of pride. 
> This happened notably in North Carolina. 
> 
> In 1935, Bill France Sr. established races in Daytona Beach, 
> with the hope that people would come to watch races 
> and that racers would race for him, 
> as other organizers tended to fleece the winners of their payouts. 
> 
> This was a success, and the series was founded in 1948. 
> Races were held in several divisions, 
> which eventually morphed into what is the "ladder": 
> - the Cup Series at the top, 
> - the Xfinity Series second, and 
> - the Truck Series third, 
> - with smaller series spread out below. 
> Chevrolet, Ford, and Toyota compete in each series.
>
> The vast majority of NASCAR drivers are American, 
> but drivers from Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australasia, and other places have competed. 
> 
> All Cup Series races are held in the United States and Mexico. 
> There are 36 points-paying races in a season, 
> along with the pre-season Clash and mid-season All-Star race. 
> 
> NASCAR runs races primarily on ovals, including superspeedways, short tracks, 
> and previously dirt tracks, but also road courses and street circuits.
>
> Richard Petty holds the Cup Series wins record with 200. 
> He is tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the championship record, 
> with seven each. 
> 
> Entering the 2025 season, Joey Logano is the defending Cup Series champion. 
> Oval tracks have highly dominated the sport.
