> Paavo Johannes Nurmi (Finnish pronunciation: [ˈpɑːʋo ˈnurmi] ; 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973) 
> was a Finnish middle-distance and long-distance runner. 
> He was called the "Flying Finn" because he dominated distance running in the 1920s. 
> Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1,500 metres and 20 kilometres, 
> and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. 
> At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. 
> Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.
>
> Born into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. 
> In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen 
> and began developing a strict training program. 
> 
> Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics 
> en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. 
> After winning a silver medal in the 5,000 m, 
> he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. 
> 
> In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, 
> the 5,000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. 
> He set new world records for the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m with just an hour between the races, 
> and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. 
> 
> Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races 
> and returned home with five gold medals, 
> although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.
>
> Struggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, 
> Nurmi found his long-time rivals compatriot Ville Ritola 
> and Sweden's Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. 
> 
> At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title 
> but was beaten for the gold in the 5,000 m and the 3,000 m steeplechase. 
> 
> He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events 
> such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. 
> Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. 
> 
> In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, 
> Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council 
> that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. 
> Although he was never declared a professional, 
> Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.
>
> Nurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, 
> and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, 
> becoming one of the richest people in Finland. 
> 
> In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. 
> Nurmi's running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the "Phantom Finn", 
> while his achievements, training methods and running style 
> influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. 
> 
> Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, 
> has been credited with introducing the "even pace" strategy and analytic approach to running, 
> and for making running a major international sport.
