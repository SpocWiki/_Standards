> usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. 
> 
> The marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. 
> There are also wheelchair divisions. More than 800 marathons are held worldwide each year, 
> with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, 
> as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.
>

> the marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896 in Athens. 
> 
> The distance did not become standardized until 1921. 
> The distance is also included in the World Athletics Championships, which began in 1983. 
> It is the only running road race included in both championship competitions 
> (walking races on the roads are also contested in both).
