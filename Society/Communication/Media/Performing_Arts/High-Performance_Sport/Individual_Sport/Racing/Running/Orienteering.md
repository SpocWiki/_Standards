## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Orienteering** is a group of sports in which participants use a map and compass 
> to navigate from point to point in unfamiliar terrain as quickly as possible.
>
> The sport originated from military land-navigation training in the late 19th century. 
> It has since evolved into several competitive forms 
> where participants race against the clock while navigating through checkpoints. 
> 
> Variants include automobile, underwater, mountain bike, ski, and trail orienteering. 
> The most common form is foot orienteering, also known as FootO.
>
> In formal foot-orienteering competitions, participants are given a specially prepared orienteering map, usually topographical, which they use to locate control points.
>
> Orienteering is part of the World Games and the World Police and Fire Games.
