## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Luge** is a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleds supine (face-up) and feet-first. 
> A luger begins seated, propelling themselves initially 
> from handles on either side of the start ramp, 
> then steers by using the calf muscles to flex the sled's runners 
> or by exerting opposite shoulder pressure to the pod. 
> 
> Racing sleds weigh 21–25 kg (46–55 lb) for singles and 25–30 kg (55–66 lb) for doubles. 
> Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport that employs that sled and technique. 
>
> It is not to be confused with skeleton bob, 
> which is also a single person tray-like sled in the bobsleigh family, 
> and the name of the sport that uses that sled, but which is designed for a running start, 
> steering by shoulders and feet, and to be laid on face down and head first. 
> 
> While skeleton and bobsleigh are part of one international federation and sport, 
> luge is organised separately by the International Luge Federation (FIL).
>
> Lugers can reach speeds of over 140 km/h (87 mph; 39 m/s), 
> and is the fastest of the three 'sliding' sports. 
> 
> Austrian Manuel Pfister reached a top speed of 154 km/h (96 mph; 43 m/s) 
> on a track in Whistler, Canada, prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
> Lugers compete against a timer in one of the most precisely timed sports in the world—
> to one millisecond on artificial tracks.
>
> The first recorded use of the term "luge" dates to 1905 
> and derives from the Savoy/Swiss dialect of the French word luge, meaning "small coasting sled".
