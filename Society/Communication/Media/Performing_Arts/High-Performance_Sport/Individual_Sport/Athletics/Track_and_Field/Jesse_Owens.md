> James Cleveland "Jesse" Owens (September 12, 1913 – March 31, 1980) 
> was an American track and field athlete who made history at the 1936 Olympic Games 
> by becoming the first track and field athlete to win four gold medals in a single Olympics. 
> He is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes in track and field history.
>
> Owens excelled in events like short sprints and the long jump 
> and was recognized in his lifetime as "perhaps the greatest and most famous athlete in track and field history". 
> 
> He won four events and set five world records and tied another, all in less than an hour, 
> at the 1935 Big Ten Championships in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
> a feat that has never been equaled and has been called 
> "the greatest 45 minutes ever in sport". 
> 
> He won four NCAA titles in both 1935 and 1936, bringing his total to eight—
> an unparalleled achievement that remains unmatched to this day.
>
> He achieved international fame at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, 
> by winning four gold medals: 100 meters, long jump, 200 meters, and 4 × 100-meter relay. He was the most successful athlete at the Games and, as a black American man, was credited by ESPN with "single-handedly crushing Hitler's myth of Aryan supremacy".
>
> The Jesse Owens Award is USA Track & Field's highest accolade for the year's best track and field athlete. In a 1950 Associated Press poll, Owens was voted the greatest track and field athlete for the first half of the century. In 1999, he was on the six-man short-list for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Century. That same year, he was ranked the sixth greatest North American athlete of the twentieth century and the highest-ranked in his sport by ESPN.
