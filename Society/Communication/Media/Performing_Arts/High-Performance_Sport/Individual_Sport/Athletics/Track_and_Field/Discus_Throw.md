> The discus throw, also known as disc throw, is a track and field event in which the participant athlete throws an oblate spheroid weight –  called a discus –  in an attempt to mark a further distance than other competitors. It is an ancient sport, as demonstrated by the fifth-century-BC Myron statue Discobolus. Although not part of the current pentathlon, it was one of the events of the ancient Greek pentathlon, which can be dated back to at least 708 BC, and it is part of the modern decathlon.
