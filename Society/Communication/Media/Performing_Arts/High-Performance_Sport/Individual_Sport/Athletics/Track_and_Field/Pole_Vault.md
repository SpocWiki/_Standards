## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Pole vaulting, also known as pole jumping, is a track and field event 
> in which an athlete uses a long and flexible pole, usually made from fiberglass or carbon fiber, 
> as an aid to jump over a bar. 
> 
> Pole jumping was already practiced by the ancient Egyptians, ancient Greeks 
> and the ancient Irish people, although modern pole vaulting, 
> an athletic contest where height is measured, 
> was first established by the German teacher Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths in the 1790s. 
> It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and since 2000 for women.
>
> It is typically classified as one of the four major jumping events in athletics, alongside the high jump, long jump and triple jump. It is unusual among track and field events in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate, even at a basic level. A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics, including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg, reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the events. Physical attributes such as speed, agility and strength, along with technical skill, are essential to pole vaulting.
