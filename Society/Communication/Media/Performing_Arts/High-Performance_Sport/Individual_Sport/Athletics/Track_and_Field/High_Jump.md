## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The high jump is a track and field event 
> in which competitors must jump unaided over a horizontal bar 
> placed at measured heights without dislodging it. 
> 
> In its modern, most-practiced format, a bar is placed between two standards 
> with a crash mat for landing. 
> 
> Since ancient times, competitors have successively improved their technique, today employing the universally preferred Fosbury Flop, in which athletes run towards the bar and leap head first with their back to the bar.
>
> The discipline is, alongside the pole vault, one of two vertical clearance events in the Olympic athletics program. It is contested at the World Championships in Athletics and the World Athletics Indoor Championships, and is a common occurrence at track and field meets. The high jump was among the first events deemed acceptable for women, having been held at the 1928 Olympic Games.

> Javier Sotomayor (Cuba) is the world record holder with a jump of 2.45 m (8 ft 1⁄4 in) set in 1993 – the longest-standing record in the history of the men's high jump. Yaroslava Mahuchikh (Ukraine) is the women's world record holder with a jump of 2.10 m (6 ft 10+1⁄2 in) set in 2024.
