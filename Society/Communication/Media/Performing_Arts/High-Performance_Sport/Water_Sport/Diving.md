## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Diving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, 
> usually while performing acrobatics. 
> 
> Diving is an internationally recognised sport that is part of the Olympic Games.  
> In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.
>
> Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as gymnasts and dancers, including strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic judgement and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. Dmitri Sautin holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.
