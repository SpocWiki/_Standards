> **Choreography** is the art of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies 
> (or their depictions) in which motion or form or both are specified. 
> Choreography may also refer to the design itself. 
> A choreographer creates choreographies through the art of choreography, 
> a process known as choreographing. 
> It most commonly refers to dance choreography.
>
> In dance, choreography may also refer to the design itself, sometimes expressed by means of dance notation. Dance choreography is sometimes called dance composition. Aspects of dance choreography include the compositional use of organic unity, rhythmic or non-rhythmic articulation, theme and variation, and repetition. The choreographic process may employ improvisation to develop innovative movement ideas. Generally, choreography designs dances intended to be performed as concert dance.
>
> The art of choreography involves specifying human movement and form in terms of space, shape, time, and energy, typically within an emotional or non-literal context. Movement language is taken from dance techniques of ballet, contemporary dance, jazz, hip hop dance, folk dance, techno, K-pop, religious dance, pedestrian movement, or combinations of these.
