## History 

Modern Olympic Games started after Greece achieved Independence from the [[../../../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~2~Holocene/Age~3~Meghalayan/Middle_Ages/1300-Late_Middle-Ages/1300-Ottoman_Empire]]. 
They were sponsored by 
Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the [Greek War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence "Greek War of Independence") from the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") in 1821. 
[Evangelos Zappas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos_Zappas "Evangelos Zappas"), a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to [King Otto of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Otto_of_Greece "King Otto of Greece"), in 1856, 
offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games. 
Zappas sponsored the first [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappas_Olympics "Zappas Olympics") in 1859, which was held in an [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") city square. 
Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. 
Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient [Panathenaic Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaic_Stadium "Panathenaic Stadium") so that it could host all future Olympic Games. 

### Modern Olympic Games  

Initially only Summer Games(S) were held. 
As of 1924 also Winter Games appeared, initially in the same year. 
As of 1994 the Winter Games are held interleaved with 2 year distance to the Summer Games.
