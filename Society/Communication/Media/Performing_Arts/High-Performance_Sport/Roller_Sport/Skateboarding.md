> **Skateboarding** is an action sport 
> that involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard, 
> as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry job, 
> and a method of transportation. 
> 
> Originating in the United States, 
> skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. 
> 
> A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an 
> estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. 
> 
> In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding would be represented 
> at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams. 
> Skateboarding made its Olympic debut in 2020 and was included in the 2024 games.
>
> Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and more recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although legal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.
