## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Nordic skiing encompasses the various types of skiing 
> in which the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner 
> that allows the heel to rise off the ski, 
> unlike alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. 
> Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing.
>
> Olympic events are competitive cross-country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined — 
> an event combining cross-country skiing and ski jumping. 
> 
> The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships host these sports every odd-numbered year, 
> but there are also separate championships in other events, 
> such as Telemark skiing and ski flying. 
> 
> Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, 
> but not included as a Nordic discipline under the rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS). 
> Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the International Biathlon Union.
>
> The biomechanics of competitive cross-country skiing and ski jumping 
> have been the subject of serious study. 
> 
> Cross-country skiing requires strength and endurance 
> and ski jumping requires aerodynamic efficiency, 
> both of which requirements translate into specific skills to be optimized in training and competition.
