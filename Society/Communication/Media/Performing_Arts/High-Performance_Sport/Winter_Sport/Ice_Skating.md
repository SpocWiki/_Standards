## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Ice skating is the self-propulsion and gliding of a person across a flat ice surface, 
> using metal-bladed ice skates. 
> 
> People skate for various reasons, including 
> recreation (fun), exercise, competitive sports, and commuting. 
> 
> Ice skating may be performed 
> on naturally frozen bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers, 
> and on human-made ice surfaces both indoors and outdoors.
>
> Natural ice surfaces used by skaters can accommodate a variety of winter sports which generally require an enclosed area, but are also used by skaters who need ice tracks and trails for distance skating and speed skating. Man-made ice surfaces include ice rinks, ice hockey rinks, bandy fields, ice tracks required for the sport of ice cross downhill, and arenas.
>
> Various formal sports involving ice skating have emerged since the 19th century. Ice hockey, bandy, rinkball, and ringette are team sports played with, respectively, a flat sliding puck, a ball, and a rubber ring. Synchronized skating is a unique artistic team sport derived from figure skating. Figure skating, ice cross downhill, speed skating, and barrel jumping (a discipline of speed skating) are among the sporting disciplines for individuals.
