> Ski jumping is a winter sport in which competitors aim to achieve the farthest jump 
> after sliding down on their skis from a specially designed curved ramp. 
> 
> Along with jump length, competitor's aerial style and other factors also affect the final score. 
> Ski jumping was first contested in Norway in the late 19th century, 
> and later spread through Europe and North America in the early 20th century. 
> Along with cross-country skiing, it constitutes the traditional group of Nordic skiing disciplines.
>
> The ski jumping venue, commonly referred to as a hill, consists of the jumping ramp (in-run), 
> take-off table, and a landing hill. Each jump is evaluated according to the distance covered and the style performed. The distance score is related to the construction point (also known as the K-point), which is a line drawn in the landing area and serves as a "target" for the competitors to reach.
>
> The score of each judge evaluating the style can reach a maximum of 20 points. The jumping technique has evolved over the years, from jumps with the skis parallel and both arms extended forward, to the "V-style", which is widely used today.
>
> Ski jumping has been included at the Winter Olympics since 1924 and at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships since 1925. Women's participation in the sport began in the 1990s, while the first women's event at the Olympics has been held in 2014. All major ski jumping competitions are organised by the International Ski Federation.
>
> Ski jumping is not limited to winter conditions and can also be practiced during the summer months, thanks to specially designed facilities that simulate the snowy environment. In summer ski jumping, the in-run — which is the part of the hill where the jumper gains speed before takeoff — is constructed with tracks made from smooth porcelain materials.. The highest level summer competition is the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, contested since 1994.
