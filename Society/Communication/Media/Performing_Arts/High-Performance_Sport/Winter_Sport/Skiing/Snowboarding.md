## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Snowboarding** is both a recreational pastime and a competitive winter sport, 
> in which an individual rides down snow-covered slopes or terrain 
> while standing on a specially designed board called a snowboard. 
> 
> This board is securely fastened to the rider’s feet using bindings, 
> ensuring that the snowboard remains attached throughout the ride. 
> 
> The sport requires a combination of balance, control, 
> and skill to navigate various snow conditions and terrains, 
> ranging from groomed ski runs to natural backcountry slopes.
>
> Over the years, snowboarding has grown in popularity and recognition, and it is now an official discipline featured in major international competitions, including the Winter Olympic Games and the Winter Paralympic Games.
>
> The origins of snowboarding can be traced back to the United States, where it was developed as a unique blend of influences from other board sports and winter activities. Skateboarding, surfing, sledding, and skiing all played a role in shaping the early versions of the sport. As it evolved, snowboarding attracted a dedicated following and gradually spread across the globe. Its growing popularity and athletic appeal led to its official debut as a Winter Olympic sport at the Nagano Games in Japan in 1998 and featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. As of 2015, its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.
