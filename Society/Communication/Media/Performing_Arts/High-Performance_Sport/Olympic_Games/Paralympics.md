## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Paralympic Games or Paralympics 
> is a periodic series of international multisport events 
> involving athletes with a range of disabilities. 
> 
> There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, 
> which since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, 
> have been held shortly after the corresponding Olympic Games. 
> All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).
>
> The Paralympics began as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. 
> The 1960 Games in Rome drew 400 athletes with disabilities from 23 countries, 
> as proposed by doctor Antonio Maglio. 
> 
> Currently it is one of the largest international sporting events: the 2020 Summer Paralympics featuring 4,520 athletes from 163 National Paralympic Committees. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.
>
> The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with and in a similar way to the Olympic Games. The IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities (although since 1992, people with intellectual disabilities also participate in the Paralympic Games), and the Deaflympics held since 1924 are exclusive for deaf athletes.
>
> Given the wide variety of disabilities of Para athletes, there are several categories in which they compete. The allowable disabilities are divided into ten eligible impairment types: impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. These categories are further divided into various subcategories.
