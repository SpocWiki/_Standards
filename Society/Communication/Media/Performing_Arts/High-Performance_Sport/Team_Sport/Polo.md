> **Polo** is a stick and ball game that is played on horseback as a traditional field sport. 
> It is one of the world's oldest known team sports, 
> originating as Chovgan (Persian: چوگان) in ancient Persia over 2,000 years ago, 
> and later adopted by the Western world from its modern form developed in India.
>
> Polo has been called "The Sport of Kings" 
> and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society, often supported by sponsorship. 
> 
> The progenitor of polo and its variants existed from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD, 
> as an equestrian game played in Persia. 
> From Iran, where the sport evolved and developed, the game became popular around the world, 
> with well over 100 member countries in the Federation of International Polo, 
> and is played professionally in 16 countries; it was also an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1936.
>
> Arena polo is an indoor or semi-outdoor variant with similar rules, 
> and is played with three riders per team. The playing field is smaller, enclosed and usually of compacted sand or fine aggregate. Arena polo has more manoeuvering due to space limitations, and uses an air-inflated ball slightly larger than the hard solid ball used in field polo. Standard mallets are used, though slightly larger-head arena mallets are an option.
>
> Mastery in horseriding is a must to play this game. There are also risks of injuries mainly from falling from the horse; therefore, one should be physically active and strong.
