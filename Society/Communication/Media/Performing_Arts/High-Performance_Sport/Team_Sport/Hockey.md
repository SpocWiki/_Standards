## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hockey** is a family of stick sports where two opposing teams use hockey sticks 
> to propel a ball or disk into a goal. 
> 
> There are many types of hockey, and the individual sports 
> vary in rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface. 
> 
> Hockey includes both summer and winter variations that may be played 
> - on an outdoor field, 
> - sheet of ice, or an 
> - indoor gymnasium. 
> 
> Some forms of hockey require skates, either inline, roller or ice, while others do not. 
> 
> The various games are usually distinguished 
> by proceeding the word hockey with a qualifier, as in 
> - field hockey, 
> - ice hockey, 
> - roller hockey, 
> - rink hockey, or 
> - floor hockey.
>
> In each of these sports, two teams play against each other 
> by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), 
> into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 
> 
> Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a puck) 
> with a hole in the center instead. 
> 
> The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 
> during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. 
> 
> The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s 
> to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion 
> as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. 
> 
> The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, 
> is not a true variant because it was designed in the 1990s 
> and modelled on the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, 
> which was invented in Canada in 1963 by Sam Jacks, 
> the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey in 1936.
>
> Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey, 
> but are not generally referred to as hockey include lacrosse, hurling, camogie, and shinty.
