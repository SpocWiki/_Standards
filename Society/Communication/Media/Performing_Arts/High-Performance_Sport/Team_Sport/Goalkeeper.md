> In many team sports that involve scoring goals, the **Goalkeeper** 
> (sometimes termed goaltender, netminder, GK, goalie, or keeper) 
> is a designated player charged with directly preventing the opposing team from scoring 
> by blocking or intercepting opposing shots on goal. 
> 
> Such positions exist in bandy, rink bandy, camogie, association football, Gaelic football, international rules football, floorball, handball, hurling, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, water polo, and shinty, as well as in other sports.
>
> In most sports that involve scoring in a net, 
> rules apply to the goalkeeper that do not apply to other players. 
> These rules are often instituted to protect the goalkeeper 
> from being a target for dangerous or even violent actions. 
> 
> This is most apparent in sports such as ice hockey and lacrosse, 
> where goalkeepers are required to wear special equipment like heavy pads and a face mask 
> to protect their bodies from the impact of the playing object (e.g., a ball or puck).
>
> In some sports, goalkeepers may have the same rights as other players 
> as well as additional rules applicable only to their position; 
> in association football, for example, the keeper is allowed to kick the ball 
> just as any other player but may also use their hands to handle the ball in a restricted area.  
> 
> In other sports, goalkeepers may be limited in the actions they are allowed to take 
> or the area of the field or rink where they may be; in the NHL, for example, 
> goalkeepers may not play the puck in the restricted areas behind the net 
> or take the puck across the red line.
>
> In some sports, like Cycle ball and Unicycle hockey, there is no designated goalkeeper, 
> but any player can perform that function on the condition that only one acts in that role at a time.
>
> In some sports, like basketball, acting as a goalkeeper is considered against the rules.
