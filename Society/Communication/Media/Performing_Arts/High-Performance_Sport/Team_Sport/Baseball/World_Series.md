> The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
> 
> It has been contested since 1903 between the champion teams of 
> the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). 
> 
> The winning team, determined through a best-of-seven playoff (except in 1903 and from 1919–1921, when a best-of-nine format was used), is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.
>
> The series is traditionally played in October, although before expansion of the regular-season schedule from 154 to 162 games the event occasionally started in late September (most recently in 1955) and the entire 1918 series took place early in that month due to the World War I "Work or Fight" order forcing an early end to that year's regular season, while some more recent editions have been contested into November due to in-season delays and expansion of earlier postseason rounds. Because the series is played in the fall (autumn) season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.

> Before the AL and NL were split into divisions in 1969, the team with the best regular-season win–loss record in each league won that league's pennant and advanced to the World Series, barring a tie necessitating a pennant playoff. Since 1969 each league has conducted a League Championship Series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding the World Series to determine which of its teams will advance, while those series have been preceded in turn by Division Series (ALDS and NLDS) since 1995, and Wild Card games or series in each league since 2012. Until 2002, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between the AL and NL. From 2003 to 2016, home-field advantage was given to the league that won that year's All-Star Game. Starting in 2017, home-field advantage was awarded to the league champion team with the better regular-season win–loss record regardless of that team's seeding in earlier postseason rounds (i.e. a Wild Card team in one league will be given home-field advantage over a division winner in the other league if it had the better record or wins the tie-breaking procedure).

> The World Series has been contested 121 times through 2025, with the AL team winning 68 times and the NL team 53.
