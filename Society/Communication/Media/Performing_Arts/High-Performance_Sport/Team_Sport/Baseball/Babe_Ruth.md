> George Herman "Babe" Ruth (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) 
> was an American professional baseball player 
> whose career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935. 
> 
> Nicknamed "the Bambino" and "the Sultan of Swat", 
> he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, 
> but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. 
> 
> Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture 
> and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. 
> In 1936, Ruth was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its "first five" inaugural members.
>
> At age seven, Ruth was sent to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, 
> a reformatory where he was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers, 
> the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player.
>  
> In 1914, Ruth was signed to play Minor League baseball for the Baltimore Orioles 
> but was soon sold to the Red Sox. 
> 
> By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, 
> a feat unusual for any player in the dead-ball era. 
> Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher 
> and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox, 
> he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. 
> With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 with 29.
>
> After that season, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. 
> The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86-year championship drought 
> and popularized the "Curse of the Bambino" superstition. 
> 
> In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven American League (AL) pennants 
> and four World Series championships. 
> His big swing led to escalating home run totals 
> that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity 
> but also helped usher in baseball's live-ball era, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy 
> to a sport where the home run was a major factor. 
> 
> As part of the Yankees' vaunted "Murderers' Row" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, 
> which extended his own MLB single-season record by a single home run. 
> Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934, 
> and he retired after a short stint with the Boston Braves the following year. 
> In his career, he led the AL in home runs twelve times.
>
> During Ruth's career, he was the target of intense press and public attention 
> for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. 
> 
> After his retirement as a player, he was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, 
> most likely because of poor behavior during parts of his playing career. 
> 
> In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, 
> especially in support of American efforts in World War II. 
> In 1946, he became ill with nasopharyngeal cancer and died from the disease two years later. 
> Ruth remains a major figure in American culture.
