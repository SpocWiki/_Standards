> **American Football**, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada 
> and also known as gridiron football, is a team sport 
> played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. 
> 
> The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, 
> attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or throwing it, 
> while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, 
> aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. 
> 
> The offense must advance the ball at least ten yards in four downs or plays; 
> if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, 
> but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. 
> 
> Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone 
> for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. 
> 
> The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. 
> In the case of a tie after four quarters, the game enters overtime.
>
> American football evolved in the United States, 
> originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. 
> 
> The first American football game was played on November 6, 1869, 
> between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, 
> using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. 
> 
> A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp, 
> the "Father of American Football", established the snap, the line of scrimmage, 
> eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs. 
> 
> Later rule changes legalized the forward pass, created the neutral zone, 
> and specified the size and shape of the football. 
> 
> The sport is closely related to Canadian football, 
> which evolved in parallel with and at the same time as the American game, 
> although its rules were developed independently from those of Camp. 
> 
> Most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer 
> are also present in Canadian football. 
> The two sports are considered the primary variants of gridiron football.
>
> American football is the most popular sport in the United States 
> in terms of broadcast viewership audience. 
> 
> The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, 
> with the other major levels being high school and youth football. 
> 
> As of 2022, nearly 1.04 million high-school athletes play the sport in the U.S., 
> with another 81,000 college athletes in the NCAA and the NAIA. 
> 
> The National Football League (NFL) has one of the highest average attendance 
> of any professional sports league in the world. 
> 
> Its championship game, the Super Bowl, 
> ranks among the most-watched club sporting events globally. 
> 
> In 2022, the league had an annual revenue of around $18.6 billion, 
> making it the most valuable sports league in the world. 
> 
> Other professional and amateur leagues exist worldwide, 
> but the sport does not have the international popularity of other American sports 
> like baseball or basketball; 
> 
> The sport maintains a growing following in the rest of North America, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.
