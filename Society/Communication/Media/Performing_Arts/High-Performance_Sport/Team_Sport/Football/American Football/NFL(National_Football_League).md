> The National Football League (NFL) 
> is a professional American football league in the United States. 
> 
> Composed of 32 teams, it is divided equally between 
> - the American Football Conference (AFC) and 
> - the National Football Conference (NFC). 
> 
> The NFL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada 
> and the highest professional level of American football in the world. 
> 
> Each NFL season begins annually with a three-week preseason in August, 
> followed by the 18-week regular season, 
> which runs from early September to early January, 
> with each team playing 17 games and having one bye week. 
> 
> Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference, 
> including the four division winners and three wild card teams, 
> advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament, 
> which culminates in the Super Bowl, played in early February 
> between the winners of the AFC and NFC championship games. 
> 
> The NFL is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.
>
> The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) 
> before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. 
> 
> After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, 
> a playoff system was implemented in 1933 
> that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966. 
> 
> Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), 
> the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 
> to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues 
> and has remained as the final game of each NFL season 
> since the merger was completed in 1970. 
> 
> The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, 
> and the sports league with the most valuable teams. 
> 
> The NFL also has the highest average attendance (67,591) 
> of any professional sports league in the world 
> and is the most popular sports league in the United States. 
> 
> The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, 
> with the individual games accounting for 
> many of the most watched television programs in American history 
> and occupying the top five of Nielsen's all-time most-watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.
>
> The Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with thirteen, 
> winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards. 
> 
> Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers 
> are tied for the most Super Bowl victories at six each. 
> 
> The reigning league champions are the Philadelphia Eagles.
