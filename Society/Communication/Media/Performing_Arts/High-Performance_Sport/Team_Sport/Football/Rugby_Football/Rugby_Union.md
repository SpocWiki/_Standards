> Rugby union football, commonly known simply as rugby union or often just rugby, 
> is a close-contact team sport that originated at Rugby School in England 
> in the first half of the 19th century. 
> 
> Rugby is based on running with the ball in hand. 
> In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, 
> using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field called a pitch. 
> The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.
>
> Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by people regardless of gender, age or size. In 2023, there were more than 10 million people playing worldwide, of whom 8.4 million were registered players. World Rugby, previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 116 countries as full members and 18 associate members.
>
> In 1845, the first laws were written by pupils at Rugby School; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C. to leave The Football Association in 1863 and, in 1895, the split between rugby union and rugby league. Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.
>
> Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of the United Kingdom and Ireland, 
> with other early exponents of the sport including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. 
> 
> The sport is followed primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Georgia, Southern Africa, Argentina, and in recent times also, Japan, Korea, South America, the United States and Canada, its growth occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and through French proponents (Rugby Europe) in Europe. 
> 
> Countries that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include 
> Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Wales.
>
> International matches have taken place since 1871 
> when the first game was played between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. 
> 
> The Rugby World Cup, first held in 1987, is held every four years. 
> The Six Nations Championship in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere 
> are other important international competitions that are held annually.
>
> The Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991, and the United States won their inaugural title. 
> There is also the Women's Six Nations Championship which is held annually alongside the men's counterpart. 
>
> National club and provincial competitions include the Premiership in England, 
> the Top 14 in France, the Bunnings NPC in New Zealand, the League One in Japan 
> and the Currie Cup in South Africa. 
> 
> Other transnational club competitions include the 
> - United Rugby Championship of club teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, 
> - European Rugby Champions Cup in Europe, and 
> - Super Rugby in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.
