> is a German football executive and former manager and player 
> who most recently managed Premier League club Liverpool.

>
> Klopp spent most of his playing career at Mainz 05. 
> He was initially deployed as a striker, but was later moved to defence. 
> 
> Upon retiring in 2001, Klopp became the club's manager, and secured Bundesliga promotion in 2004. 
> After suffering relegation in the 2006–07 season and unable to achieve promotion, 
> Klopp resigned in 2008 as the club's longest-serving manager. He then became manager of Borussia Dortmund, guiding them to the Bundesliga title in 2010–11, before winning Dortmund's first-ever domestic double during a record-breaking season. Klopp also guided Dortmund to a runner-up finish in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League before leaving in 2015 as their longest-serving manager.
>
> Klopp was appointed manager of Liverpool in 2015. 
> He has guided the club to UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and 2022, 
> and won the trophy in 2019 to secure his first – and Liverpool's sixth – title in the competition. 
> 
> Klopp's side finished second in the 2018–19 Premier League, registering 97 points; the then third-highest total in the history of the English top division, and the most by a team without winning the title. The following season, Klopp won the UEFA Super Cup and Liverpool's first FIFA Club World Cup, before delivering Liverpool's first Premier League title, amassing a club record 99 points and breaking a number of top-flight records. These achievements won him back-to-back FIFA Coach of the Year awards in 2019 and 2020. Klopp also won a cup double of the EFL Cup and FA Cup in 2022, as well as another EFL Cup in 2024.
>
> Klopp is a notable proponent of Gegenpressing, whereby the team, after losing possession, 
> immediately attempts to win back possession, rather than falling back to regroup. 
> 
> He has described his sides as playing "heavy metal" football, in reference to their pressing and high attacking output. 
> Klopp has cited his main influences as Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi, and former Mainz coach Wolfgang Frank. 
> The importance of emotion is something Klopp has underlined throughout his managerial career, 
> and he has gained both admiration and notoriety for his enthusiastic touchline celebrations.
