> Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛd(ʒi)sõ(w) aˈɾɐ̃tʃiz du nasiˈmẽtu]; 
> 23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022), better known by his nickname **Pelé** 
> (Brazilian Portuguese: [peˈlɛ]), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. 
> 
> Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, 
> he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. 
> His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, 
> is recognised as a Guinness World Record. 
> 
> In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee 
> and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. 
> 
> In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century 
> by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) 
> and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century, alongside Diego Maradona.
>
> Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. 
> During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 
> 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so 
> and the youngest player to win a World Cup (17), 
> though he only played two matches during the 1962 edition. 
> 
> He was nicknamed O Rei (The King) following the 1958 tournament. 
> With 77 goals in 92 games for Brazil, Pelé held the record as 
> the national team's top goalscorer for over fifty years. 
> 
> At club level, he is Santos's all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659 games. 
> In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, 
> and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. 
> 
> Credited with connecting the phrase "The Beautiful Game" with football, 
> Pelé's "electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals" made him a global star, 
> and his teams toured internationally to take full advantage of his popularity. 
> 
> During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. 
> After retiring in 1977, Pelé was a worldwide ambassador for football 
> and made many acting and commercial ventures. 
> 
> In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.
>
> Pelé averaged almost a goal per game throughout his career 
> and could strike the ball with either foot, 
> as well as being able to anticipate his opponents' movements. 
> 
> While predominantly a striker, he could also be a playmaker, 
> providing assists with his vision and passing ability. 
> 
> He would often use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. 
> In Brazil, he was hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football 
> and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. 
> 
> His emergence at the 1958 World Cup, where he became a black global sporting star, 
> was a source of inspiration. 
> 
> Throughout his career and in his retirement, 
> Pelé received numerous individual and team awards for his performance on the field, 
> his record-breaking achievements, and his legacy in the sport.
