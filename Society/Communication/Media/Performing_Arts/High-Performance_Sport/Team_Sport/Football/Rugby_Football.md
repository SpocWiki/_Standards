## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Rugby football is the collective name for the separate team sports of rugby union and rugby league.
>
> Rugby football started at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England, 
> where the rules were first codified in 1845. 
> 
> Forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to the Middle Ages 
> (see medieval football). 
> Rugby football spread to other English public schools in the 19th century 
> and across the British Empire as former pupils continued to play it.
>
> Rugby football split into two codes in 1895, 
> when twenty-one clubs from the North of England left the Rugby Football Union 
> to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) 
> at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, over payments to players 
> who took time off work to play ("broken-time payments"), 
> thus making rugby league the first code to turn professional and pay players. 
> 
> Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later, 
> following the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. 
> The respective world governing bodies are World Rugby (rugby union) 
> and the International Rugby League (rugby league).
>
> Canadian football and, to a lesser extent, American football 
> were once considered forms of rugby football, but are seldom now referred to as such. 
> 
> The governing body of Canadian football, Football Canada, 
> was known as the Canadian Rugby Union as late as 1967, 
> more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with rugby rules.
