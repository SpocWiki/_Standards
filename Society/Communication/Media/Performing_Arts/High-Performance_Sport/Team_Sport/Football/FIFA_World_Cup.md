> The **FIFA World Cup**, often called the World Cup, 
> is an international association football competition among the senior men's national teams 
> of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), 
> the sport's global governing body. 
> The tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, 
> with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. 
> The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament.
>
> The contest starts with the qualification phase, 
> which takes place over the preceding three years 
> to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 
> 
> 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) 
> over the course of about a month. 
> The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group stage of the tournament. 
> The competition is scheduled to expand to 48 teams, starting with the 2026 tournament.
>
> As of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held 
> since the event's inception in 1930, and a total of 80 national teams have competed. 
> 
> The trophy has been won by eight national teams. 
> With five wins, Brazil  is the only team to have played in every tournament. 
> The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; 
> Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural winner Uruguay, 
> each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title each.
>
> The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, 
> as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. 
> The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, 
> close to half of the global population, while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup 
> was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the final match.
>
> Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, 
> most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. 
> The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, 
> which will give Mexico the distinction of 
> being the first country to host games in three World Cups.
