## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **association football**, more commonly known as football or soccer, 
> is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, 
> who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. 
> 
> The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team 
> by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal 
> defended by the opposing team. 
> 
> Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, 
> for a total match time of 90 minutes.
>  With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, 
>  it is the world's most popular sport.
>
> The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, 
> a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. 
> 
> The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. 
> The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal 
> (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). 
> 
> When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, 
> but may also use any other part of their body, such as their head, chest and thighs, 
> except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. 
> Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. 
> 
> The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. 
> There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, 
> such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. 
> Depending on the format of the competition, 
> an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, 
> or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.
>
> Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. 
> Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: 
> AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. 
> Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. 
> National associations (e.g. The FA or JFA) are responsible 
> for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, 
> and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. 
> 
> The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the [[FIFA_World_Cup]] 
> and the FIFA Women's World Cup. 
> 
> The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, 
> surpassing the Olympic Games. 
> 
> The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are 
> the UEFA Champions League and 
> the UEFA Women's Champions League, 
> which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world. 
> 
> Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament 
> has been the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.
