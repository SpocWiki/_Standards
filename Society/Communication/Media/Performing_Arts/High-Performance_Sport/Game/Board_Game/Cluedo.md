> **Cluedo**, known as Clue in North America, is a murder mystery game 
> for three to six players (depending on editions) that was devised in 1943 
> by British board game designer Anthony E. Pratt. 
> 
> The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the United Kingdom in 1949. 
> Since then, it has been relaunched and updated several times, 
> and it is currently owned and published by the American game and toy company Hasbro.
>
> The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, 
> where the crime took place, and which weapon was used. 
> 
> Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects 
> and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board 
> representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder 
> from the other players.
>
> Numerous games, books, a film, television series, and theatre adaptations have been released as part of the Cluedo franchise. Several spinoffs have been released, featuring various extra characters, weapons, rooms, or a different gameplay. The original game is marketed as the "Classic Detective Game", and the various spinoffs are all distinguished by different slogans.
>
> In 2008, Cluedo: Discover the Secrets was created (with changes to the board, gameplay, and characters) as a modern spin-off, but was criticised in the media and by fans of the original game. Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game was then introduced in 2012, returning to Pratt's classic formula but also adding several variations.
