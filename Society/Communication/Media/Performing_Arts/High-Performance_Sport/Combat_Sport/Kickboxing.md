> **Kickboxing** (KIK-boks-ing) is a full-contact hybrid martial art and boxing type 
> based on punching and kicking. Kickboxing originated in the 1950s. 
> 
> The fight takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, mouth guards, shorts, 
> and bare feet to favor the use of kicks. 
> Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or for competition. 
> Some styles of kickboxing include: full contact karate, Muay Thai, Japanese kickboxing, Lethwei, Sanda, and Savate.
>
> Although since the dawn of humanity people have faced each other in hand-to-hand combat, 
> the first documentation on the use of kicking and punching in sports combat 
> is from ancient Greece and ancient India. 
> 
> But nevertheless, the term kickboxing originated in Japan, in the 1960s, 
> and developed in the late 1950s from karate mixed with boxing having some influence, 
> with competitions held since then. 
> American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974, 
> when the Professional Karate Association (PKA) held the first World Championships. 
> 
> Historically, kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art 
> formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles. 
> This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s, 
> and since the 1990s, kickboxing has contributed to the emergence of mixed martial arts 
> via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and folk wrestling.
>
> Although, there are many governing bodies such as World Kickboxing Organisation (WKO),  
> World Kickboxing Association, the Professional Kickboxing Association (PKA), 
> International Sport Karate Association, International Kickboxing Federation, 
> and WKN - World Kickboxing Network, among others, 
> the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations (also known as WAKO) 
> is the recognized as the official kickboxing world governing body by the IOC. 
>
> At professional level, there is no single kickboxing world championship, 
> and champion titles are issued by individual promotions, 
> such as Glory, K-1 and ONE Championship among others. 
> 
> Bouts organized under different governing bodies apply different rules, 
> such as allowing the use of knees or clinching etc.
