## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) 
> was an American professional boxer and social activist. 
> 
> A global cultural icon, widely known by the nickname "the Greatest", 
> he is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. 
> 
> He held the Ring magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970, 
> was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978, 
> and was the WBA and Ring heavyweight champion from 1978 to 1979. 
> In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated 
> and the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC.
>
> Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. 
> At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics 
> and turned professional later that year. 
> 
> He joined the Nation of Islam in the early 1960s, but later disavowed it in the mid-1970s. 
> He won the world heavyweight championship, 
> defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. 
> During that year, he denounced his birth name as a "slave name" 
> and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. 
> 
> In 1967, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, owing to his religious beliefs 
> and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, 
> and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. 
> 
> He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, 
> where his conviction was overturned in 1971. 
> He did not fight for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. 
> 
> Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War 
> made him an icon for the larger counterculture of the 1960s generation, 
> and he became a prominent, high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans 
> during the civil rights movement and throughout his career.
>
> Ali fought in several highly publicized boxing matches, 
> including fights with Liston, Joe Frazier (including the Fight of the Century, 
> to that point the biggest boxing event and the Thrilla in Manila), 
> and George Foreman in The Rumble in the Jungle. 
> 
> At a time when many boxers let their managers do the talking, 
> Ali became renowned for his provocative and outlandish persona. 
> He was famous for trash talking, 
> often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, 
> and is identified as a pioneer in hip-hop. 
> 
> He often predicted in which round he would knock out his opponent. 
> As a boxer, Ali was known for his unorthodox movement, footwork, head movement, 
> and rope-a-dope technique, among others.
>
> Outside boxing, Ali performed as a spoken word artist, releasing two studio albums: 
> I Am the Greatest! (1963) and The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay (1976). 
> Both albums received Grammy Award nominations. 
> He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. 
> Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy, and activism. 
> 
> In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, 
> which some reports attributed to boxing-related injuries, 
> though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. 
> 
> He remained an active public figure, but in his later years made fewer public appearances 
> as his condition worsened, and was cared for by his family.
