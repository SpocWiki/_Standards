> The sabre (US English: saber, both pronounced ) 
> is one of the three disciplines of modern fencing alongside foil & epee. 
> 
> The sabre weapon is for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge 
> and the back of the blade (unlike the other modern fencing weapons, 
> the épée and foil, where a touch is scored only using the point of the blade).
>
> The informal term sabre fencer is what they call sabre fencers of both genders.
