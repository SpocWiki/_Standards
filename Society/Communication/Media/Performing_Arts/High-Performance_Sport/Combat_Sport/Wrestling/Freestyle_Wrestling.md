> Freestyle wrestling is a style of wrestling. 
> It is one of two styles of wrestling contested in the Olympic Games, along with Greco-Roman. 
> High school wrestling and men's collegiate wrestling in the United States 
> are conducted under different rules and termed scholastic and collegiate wrestling. 
> U.S. collegiate women's wrestling is conducted under freestyle rules.
>
> Freestyle wrestling, like collegiate wrestling, has its origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling. 
> In both styles, the ultimate goal is to throw and pin the opponent to the mat, 
> which results in an immediate win. 
> Unlike Greco-Roman, freestyle and collegiate wrestling 
> **allow to use the legs** of the wrestler or the opponent in offense and defense.
>
> According to wrestling's world governing body, the United World Wrestling (UWW), 
> freestyle wrestling is one of the six main forms of amateur competitive wrestling 
> practiced around the globe today. The other five forms are as follows:
> - Greco-Roman wrestling
> - Grappling/submission wrestling
> - Beach wrestling
> - Pankration athlima
> - Alysh/belt wrestling
> - Traditional/folk wrestling.
>
> In 2013, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
> recommended dropping wrestling as a sport from the 2020 Olympic Games, 
> but the decision was later reversed by the IOC.
