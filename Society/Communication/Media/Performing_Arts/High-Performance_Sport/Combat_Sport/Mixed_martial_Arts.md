## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact fighting sport based on striking and grappling, 
> incorporating techniques from various combat sports from around the world. 
>
> In the early 20th century, various inter-stylistic contests took place 
> throughout Japan and the countries of East Asia. 
> 
> At the same time, in Brazil there was a phenomenon called vale tudo, 
> which became known for unrestricted fights between various styles such as 
> judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling, luta livre, Muay Thai and capoeira. 
> 
> An early high-profile mixed bout was Kimura vs Gracie in 1951. 
> In mid-20th-century Hong Kong, rooftop street fighting contests 
> between different martial arts styles 
> gave rise to Bruce Lee's hybrid martial arts style, Jeet Kune Do. 
> 
> Another precursor to modern MMA was the 1976 Ali vs. Inoki exhibition bout, 
> fought between boxer Muhammad Ali and wrestler Antonio Inoki in Japan, 
> where it later inspired the foundation of Shooto in 1985, Pancrase in 1993, and the Pride Fighting Championships in 1997.
>
> In the 1990s, the Gracie family brought their Brazilian jiu-jitsu style, 
> first developed in Brazil from the 1920s, to the United Statesâ€”which culminated in 
> the founding of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) promotion company in 1993. 
> The company held an event with **almost no rules**, 
> mostly due to the influence of Art Davie and Rorion Gracie 
> attempting to replicate mixed contests that existed in Brazil and Japan. 
> 
> They would later implement a different set of rules 
> (example: eliminating kicking a grounded opponent), 
> which differed from other leagues which were more in favour of realistic, "street-like" fights. 
> The first documented use of the term mixed martial arts was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993.
>
> Originally promoted as a competition 
> to find the most effective martial arts for real unarmed combat, 
> competitors from different fighting styles were pitted against one another 
> in contests with relatively few rules. 
> 
> Later, individual fighters incorporated multiple martial arts into their style. 
> MMA promoters were pressured to adopt additional rules to increase competitors' safety, 
> to comply with sport regulations and to broaden mainstream acceptance of the sport. 
> Following these changes, the sport has seen increased popularity 
> with a pay-per-view business that rivals boxing and professional wrestling.
