## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) by athletes 
> as a way of cheating. 
> As stated in the World Anti-Doping Code by WADA, 
> doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the anti-doping rule violations 
> outlined in Article 2.1 through Article 2.11 of the Code. 
> 
> The term doping is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. 
> The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical 
> and is prohibited by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. 
> Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection 
> exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating.
>
> The origins of doping in sports go back to the creation of the sport itself. 
> From ancient usage of substances in chariot racing to more recent controversies in doping in baseball, doping in tennis, doping at the Olympic Games, and doping at the Tour de France, 
> popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. 
> 
> The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been 
> to regulate the use of drugs in sports strictly. 
> 
> The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, 
> the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sports for the public. 
> Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport".
