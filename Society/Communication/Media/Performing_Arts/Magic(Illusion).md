> claimed to be created through supernatural means. It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world.
>

> has become a popular theatrical art form. 
> 
> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as John Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant, 
> Howard Thurston, Harry Kellar, and Harry Houdini achieved widespread commercial success 
> during what has become known as "the Golden Age of Magic", 
> a period in which performance magic became a staple of Broadway theatre, vaudeville, and music halls. 
> 
> Meanwhile, magicians such as Georges Méliès, Gaston Velle, Walter R. Booth, and Orson Welles 
> introduced pioneering filmmaking techniques informed by their knowledge of magic.
>
> Magic has retained its popularity into the 21st century 
> by adapting to the mediums of television and the internet, with magicians such as 
> David Copperfield, Penn & Teller, Paul Daniels, Criss Angel, David Blaine, Derren Brown, and Shin Lim 
> modernizing the art form. 
> Through the use of social media, magicians can now reach a wider audience than ever before.
>
> Magicians are known for closely guarding the methods they use to achieve their effects, 
> although they often share their techniques through both formal and informal training within the magic community. 
> 
> Magicians use a variety of techniques, including sleight of hand, misdirection, optical and auditory illusions, 
> hidden compartments, contortionism and specially constructed props, 
> as well as verbal and nonverbal psychological techniques such as suggestion, hypnosis, and priming.
