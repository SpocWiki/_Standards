> **Bocce** (Italian: [ˈbɔttʃe]), sometimes anglicized as bocce ball, bocci, or boccie, 
> is a ball sport belonging to the boules family. 
> 
> Developed into its present form in Italy, it is closely related to English bowls and French pétanque, 
> with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. 
> 
> Bocce is played around Western, Southern, and Southeastern Europe, 
> as well as in overseas areas with historical Italian immigrant population, 
> including Australia, North and South America, principally Argentina 
> and the southern Brazilian states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. 
> 
> Initially only played by Italian immigrants, 
> the game has slowly gained popularity among descendant generations and outside the Italian diaspora.
