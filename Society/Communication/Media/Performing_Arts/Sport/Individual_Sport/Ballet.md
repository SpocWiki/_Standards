## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ballet** (French: [balÉ›]) is a type of performance dance 
> that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century 
> and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. 
> 
> It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary. 
> Ballet has been influential globally 
> and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures. 
> Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures. 
> As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.
>
> A ballet as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production. 
> Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. 
> Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment 
> and use elaborate costumes and staging, 
> whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery.
