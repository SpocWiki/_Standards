> **Bodybuilding** is the practice of progressive resistance exercise 
> to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy. 
> An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. 
> It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, 
> distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting and calisthenics.
>
> In competitive bodybuilding, competitors appear onstage in line-ups 
> and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges 
> who rank them based on conditioning, muscularity, posing, size, stage presentation, and symmetry. 
> 
> Bodybuilders prepare for competitions by exercising and eliminating non-essential body fat. 
> This is enhanced at the final stage by a combination of carbohydrate loading and dehydration 
> to achieve maximum muscle definition and vascularity. 
> Most bodybuilders also tan and shave their bodies prior to competition.

> Bodybuilding requires significant time and effort to reach the desired results. A novice bodybuilder may be able to gain 8–15 pounds (4–7 kg) of muscle per year if they lift weights for seven hours per week, but muscle gains begin to slow down after the first two years to about 5–15 pounds (2–7 kg) per year. After five years, gains can decrease to as little as 3–10 pounds (1–5 kg) per year. Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries faster. However, using performance-enhancing drugs can have serious health risks. Furthermore, most competitions prohibit the use of these substances. Despite some calls for drug testing to be implemented, the National Physique Committee (considered the leading amateur bodybuilding federation) does not require testing.
