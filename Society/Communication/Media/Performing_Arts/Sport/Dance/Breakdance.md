> Breakdancing or breaking, also called b-boying (when performed by men) 
> or b-girling (women), is a style of street dance 
> originated by African Americans and Puerto Ricans in The Bronx borough of New York City.  
>
> Breakdancing consists mainly of four kinds of movement—toprock, footwork, power moves, and freezes—and is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in funk, soul, and hip-hop. Its modern dance elements originated among the poor youth of New York during the early 1980s. It is tied to the birth of hip-hop, whose DJs developed rhythmic break for dancers. 
>
> The dance form has expanded globally, with an array of organizations and independent competitions supporting its growth. Breaking became an Olympic sport at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, as per a December 7, 2020 decision by the International Olympic Committee, after a proposal by the World DanceSport Federation.
