## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A board game is a type of tabletop game that involves small objects (game pieces) 
> that are placed and moved in particular ways on a specially designed patterned game board, 
> potentially including other components, e.g. dice. 
> The earliest known uses of the term "board game" are between the 1840s and 1850s.
>
> While game boards are a necessary and sufficient condition of this genre, 
> card games that do not use a standard deck of cards, 
> as well as games that use neither cards nor a game board, are often colloquially included, 
> with some referring to this genre generally as "table and board games" or simply "tabletop games".
