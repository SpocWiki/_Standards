> Phineas Taylor Barnum (July 5, 1810 – April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, 
> and politician remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes 
> and founding with James Anthony Bailey the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
> 
> He was also an author, publisher, and philanthropist, although he said of himself: 
> "I am a showman by profession ... and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me." 
> According to Barnum's critics, his personal aim was "to put money in his own coffers". 
> The adage "there's a sucker born every minute" has frequently been attributed to him, 
> although no evidence exists that he had coined the phrase.
>
> Barnum became a small-business owner in his early twenties and founded a weekly newspaper 
> before moving to New York City in 1834. 
> He embarked on an entertainment career, 
> first with a variety troupe called "Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater", 
> and soon after by purchasing Scudder's American Museum, which he renamed after himself. 
> 
> He used the museum as a platform to promote hoaxes and human curiosities 
> such as the Fiji mermaid and General Tom Thumb. 
> In 1850, he promoted the American tour of Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, 
> paying her an unprecedented $1,000, equivalent to $37,796 in 2024, per night for 150 nights. 
> 
> He suffered economic reversals in the 1850s from unwise investments, 
> as well as years of litigation and public humiliation, 
> but he embarked on a lecture tour as a temperance speaker to emerge from debt. 
> His museum added America's first aquarium and expanded its wax-figure department.
>
> Barnum served two terms in the Connecticut legislature in 1865 as a Republican for Fairfield, Connecticut. 
> He spoke before the legislature concerning the ratification of 
> the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
> which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude: 
> "A human soul, 'that God has created and Christ died for,' is not to be trifled with. 
> It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab, or a Hottentot—it is still an immortal spirit." 
> 
> He was elected in 1875 as mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, 
> where he worked to improve the water supply, bring gas lighting to streets 
> and enforce liquor and prostitution laws. 
> 
> He was instrumental in the inception of Bridgeport Hospital in 1878 and was its first president. 
> The circus business, begun when he was 60 years old, was the source of much of his enduring fame. 
> He established P. T. Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan & Hippodrome in 1870, 
> a traveling circus, menagerie and museum of "freaks" that adopted many names over the years.
>
> Barnum was married to Charity Hallett from 1829 until her death in 1873, and they had four children. 
> In 1874, a few months after his wife's death, he married Nancy Fish, 
> his friend's daughter and 40 years his junior. 
> 
> They were married until 1891 when Barnum died of a stroke at his home. 
> He was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport, which he designed himself.
