> **Publishing**  is the process of making information, literature, music, software, 
> and other content, physical or digital, available to the public for sale or free of charge. 
> 
> Traditionally, the term publishing refers to the creation and distribution of printed works, 
> such as books, comic books, newspapers, and magazines to the public. 
> 
> With the advent of digital information systems, the scope has 
> expanded to include digital publishing such as e-books, digital magazines, websites, social media, music, and video game publishing.
>
> The commercial publishing industry ranges from large multinational conglomerates such as News Corp, Pearson, Penguin Random House, and Thomson Reuters to major retail brands and thousands of small independent publishers. It has various divisions such as trade/retail publishing of fiction and non-fiction, educational publishing, and academic and scientific publishing. Publishing is also undertaken by governments, civil society, and private companies for administrative or compliance requirements, business, research, advocacy, or public interest objectives. This can include annual reports, research reports, market research, policy briefings, and technical reports. Self-publishing has become very common.
>
> Publishing has evolved from a small, ancient form limited by law or religion to a modern, large-scale industry disseminating all types of information.
>
> "Publisher" can refer to a publishing company, organization, or an individual who leads a publishing company, imprint, periodical, or newspaper.
