## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Plastic arts** are art forms which involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium, 
> such as clay, wax, paint –  or even plastic in the modern sense of the word (a ductile polymer) –  
> to create works of art.  
> 
> The term is used more generally to refer to the visual arts 
> (such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, architecture, film and photography), 
> rather than literature and music.  
> 
> Materials for use in the plastic arts, in the narrower definition, 
> include those that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete, glass, or metal.
