A deadpan role typically refers to a character portrayal that involves delivering lines or expressions with a straight-faced, emotionless demeanor, often for comedic effect. This style of acting contrasts with more exaggerated or expressive performances.

Deadpan roles can vary in their subtlety and effectiveness depending on the actor's skill and the context of the performance. When done well, they can be highly effective in eliciting laughs from the audience through understatement and irony.
