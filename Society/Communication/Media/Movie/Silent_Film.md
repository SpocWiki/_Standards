> A silent film is a film without synchronized recorded sound (or more generally, no audible dialogue). 
> 
> Though silent films convey narrative and emotion visually, 
> various plot elements (such as a setting or era) or key lines of dialogue 
> may, when necessary, be conveyed by the use of inter-title cards.
>
> The term "silent film" is something of a misnomer, 
> as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds. 
> 
> During the silent era, which existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s, 
> a pianist, theater organist—or even, in larger cities, an orchestra—
> would play music to accompany the films. 
> Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music, or improvisation. 
> 
> Sometimes a person would even narrate the inter-title cards for the audience. 
> Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the film did not exist, 
> music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience. 
> 
> "Silent film" is typically used as a historical term to describe an era of cinema 
> prior to the invention of synchronized sound, but it also applies to such sound-era films as 
> - [[City Lights]], 
> - [[Modern Times]] and 
> - [[Silent Movie]] 
> which are accompanied by a music-only soundtrack in place of dialogue.
>
> The term silent film is a retronym—a term created to retroactively 
> distinguish something from later developments. 
> 
> Early sound films, starting with The Jazz Singer in 1927, 
> were variously referred to as the "talkies", "sound films", or "talking pictures". 
> 
> The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is older than film 
> (it was suggested almost immediately after Edison introduced the phonograph in 1877), 
> and some early experiments had the projectionist 
> manually adjusting the frame rate to fit the sound, 
> but because of the technical challenges involved, 
> the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s 
> with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system. 
> 
> Within a decade, the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment 
> had ceased, and the industry had moved fully into the sound era, 
> in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings 
> of spoken dialogue, music and sound effects.
>
> Most early motion pictures are considered lost owing to their physical decay, 
> as the nitrate filmstock used in that era was extremely unstable and flammable. 
> 
> Many films were destroyed, because they had negligible remaining financial value in that era. 
> It has often been claimed that around 
> 75 percent of silent films produced in the US have been lost, 
> though these estimates' accuracy cannot be determined due to a lack of numerical data.
