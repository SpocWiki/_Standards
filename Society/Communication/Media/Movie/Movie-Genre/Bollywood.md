## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Hindi cinema, popularly known as **Bollywood** and formerly as Bombay cinema, 
> is primarily produced in Mumbai. 
> 
> The popular term Bollywood is a portmanteau of "Bombay" (former name of Mumbai) and "Hollywood". 
> 
> The industry, producing films in the Hindi language, is a part of the larger Indian cinema industry, 
> which also includes South Indian cinema and other smaller film industries. 
> 
> The term 'Bollywood', often mistakenly used to refer to Indian cinema as a whole, 
> only refers to Hindi-language films, with Indian cinema being an umbrella term 
> that includes all the film industries in the country, each offering films in diverse languages and styles.
>
> In 2017, Indian cinema produced 1,986 feature films, of which the largest number, 364, have been in Hindi. In 2022, Hindi cinema represented 33% of box office revenue, followed by Telugu and Tamil representing 20% and 16% respectively. Mumbai is one of the largest centres for film production in the world. Hindi films sold an estimated 341 million tickets in India in 2019. Earlier Hindi films tended to use vernacular Hindustani, mutually intelligible by speakers of either Hindi or Urdu, while modern Hindi productions increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.
>
> The most popular commercial genre in Hindi cinema since the 1970s has been the masala film, 
> which freely mixes different genres including action, comedy, romance, drama 
> and melodrama along with musical numbers. 
> 
> Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre, 
> of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s 
> when it exceeded the American film industry's total musical output 
> after musical films declined in the West. 
> 
> The first Indian talkie, Alam Ara (1931), was produced in the Hindustani language, 
> four years after Hollywood's first sound film, The Jazz Singer (1927).
>
> Alongside commercial masala films, a distinctive genre of art films known as parallel cinema 
> has also existed, presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers. 
> In more recent years, the distinction between commercial masala and parallel cinema 
> has been gradually blurring, with an increasing number of 
> mainstream films adopting the conventions which were once strictly associated with parallel cinema.
