> The **Walt Disney Company** is an American multinational 
> mass media and entertainment conglomerate 
> that is headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California. 
> 
> Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Disney 
> as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio; it also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio 
> and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to the Walt Disney Company in 1986. 
> 
> In 1928, Disney established itself as a leader in the animation industry 
> with the short film Steamboat Willie. 
> The film used synchronized sound to become the first post-produced sound cartoon, 
> and popularized Mickey Mouse, who became Disney's mascot and corporate icon.
>
> After becoming a major success by the early 1940s, 
> Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. 
> 
> However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, 
> especially in the animation division, began to decline. 
> In 1984, Disney's shareholders voted [[Michael Eisner]] as CEO, who led a reversal of the company's decline through a combination of international theme park expansion and the highly successful Disney Renaissance period of animation in the 1990s. In 2005, under new CEO Bob Iger, the company continued to expand into a major entertainment conglomerate with the acquisitions of Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios. In 2020, Bob Chapek became the head of Disney after Iger's retirement. However, Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger was reinstated as CEO.
