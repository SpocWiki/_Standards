> **BitTorrent**, AKA torrent, is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), 
> which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet 
> in a decentralized manner. 
> The protocol is developed and maintained by Rainberry, Inc., and was first released in 2001.
>
> To send or receive files, users use a BitTorrent client on their Internet-connected computer, 
> which are available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems, 
> including an official client. 
> BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer and allow the client to find peer users, 
> known as "seeds", who may transfer the files. 
> BitTorrent downloading is considered to be faster than HTTP ("direct downloading") and FTP 
> due to the lack of a central server that could limit bandwidth.
>
> BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, 
> such as digital video files containing TV shows and video clips, or digital audio files containing songs. 
> 
> BitTorrent accounted for a third of all internet traffic in 2004, according to a study by Cachelogic. 
> As recently as 2019 BitTorrent remained a significant file sharing protocol according to Sandvine, 
> generating a substantial amount of Internet traffic, with 2.46% of downstream, 
> and 27.58% of upstream traffic, although this share has declined significantly since then.
