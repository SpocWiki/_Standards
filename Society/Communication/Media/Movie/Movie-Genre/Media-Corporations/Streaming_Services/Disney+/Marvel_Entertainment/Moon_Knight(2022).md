# [[Moon_Knight(2022)]]  

> Moon Knight is a character appearing in American [[../Marvel_Entertainment|Marvel_Entertainment]] Comics books. 
> Created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, 
> the character first appeared in Werewolf by Night #32 (August 1975).
>
> The son of a rabbi, Marc Spector served as a Force Recon Marine 
> and briefly as a CIA operative before becoming a mercenary 
> alongside his friend Jean-Paul "Frenchie" DuChamp. 
> 
> During a job in Sudan, Spector is appalled when ruthless fellow mercenary Raoul Bushman 
> attacks and kills archeologist Dr. Alraune 
> in front of the man's daughter and colleague, Marlene Alraune. 
> After fighting Bushman and being left for dead, 
> a mortally wounded Spector reaches Alraune's recently unearthed tomb 
> and is placed before a statue of the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. 
> 
> Spector dies, then suddenly revives, fully healed. 
> He claims Khonshu wants him to be the "moon's knight", the left "Fist of Khonshu", 
> redeeming his life of violence by now protecting and avenging the innocent. 
> 
> While early stories imply Spector is merely insane, it is later revealed Khonshu is real, 
> one of several entities from the Othervoid (a dimension outside normal time and space) 
> once worshipped by ancient Earth people. 
> 
> On his return to the United States, Spector invests his mercenary profits into 
> becoming the crimefighter "Moon Knight", aided by Frenchie and Marlene Alraune, 
> who becomes his lover and eventually the mother of his daughter. 
> Along with his costumed alter ego, he primarily uses three other identities 
> to gain information from different social circles: billionaire businessman Steven Grant, 
> taxicab driver Jake Lockley, and suited detective and police consultant Mr. Knight.
>
> It is later revealed Moon Knight has dissociative identity disorder (DID) 
> (incorrectly referred to as schizophrenia in some stories) 
> and that the alters known as Grant and Lockley originally manifested during his childhood. 
> 
> Other subsequent alter egos who do not assume the Moon Knight identity 
> have emerged at other points during his adulthood, 
> including a werewolf-fighting astronaut; impersonators of Khonshu, Spider-Man, Wolverine, 
> Captain America, Iron Man, and Echo; and a red-haired little girl known as the Inner Child 
> (who first appeared in the Ultimate Marvel continuity). 
> 
> It is debated in different stories whether Spector has genuine DID due to childhood trauma 
> or if his similar symptoms are the result of "brain damage" 
> caused by his psychic connection to Khonshu, 
> a connection compelling his personality to shift between 
> the four major aspects of the moon god's multi-faceted nature ("the traveler", 
> "the pathfinder", "the embracer", and "the defender of those who travel at night"). 
> Khonshu claims he created a psychic connection with Spector, Grant, and Lockley 
> when the latter were young, decades before they became Moon Knight.
>
> In most of his stories, Moon Knight has no supernatural abilities beyond 
> occasional visions of mystic insight. He relies on athletic ability, 
> advanced technology, expert combat and detective skills, 
> and a high tolerance for pain based on willpower, training, and experience. 
> 
> Since becoming Moon Knight, there have been multiple occasions 
> when the character has died only to then be resurrected by Khonshu, 
> implying he may now be effectively immortal until the moon god's protection is revoked 
> (whether Khonshu has limitations on how often he can resurrect Spector is unknown). 
> 
> For a time, Moon Knight's strength and resistance to injury could reach superhuman levels 
> depending on the phases of the moon, but this ability later vanished, while the Moon Knight identity is occasionally depicted as an independent alter ego of the others.
>
> The character has made appearances in various media outside of comics, 
> including animated series and video games. 
> [[Oscar_Isaac]] portrays Marc Spector / Moon Knight, Steven Grant / Mr. Knight, 
> and Jake Lockley in the [[../Marvel_Entertainment|Marvel_Entertainment]] Cinematic Universe live-action television series Moon Knight (2022).
