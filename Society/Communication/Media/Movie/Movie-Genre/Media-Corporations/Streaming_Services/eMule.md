> **eMule** is a free peer-to-peer file sharing application for Microsoft Windows. 
> Started in May 2002 as an alternative to eDonkey2000, 
> eMule now connects to both the [[eDonkey]] network and the [[Kad_network]]. 
> 
> The distinguishing features of eMule are the direct exchange of sources between client nodes, 
> fast recovery of corrupted downloads, and the use of a credit system to reward frequent uploaders. 
> Furthermore, eMule transmits data in zlib-compressed form to save bandwidth.
>
> eMule is coded in C++ using the Microsoft Foundation Classes. 
> Since July 2002 eMule has been free software, released under the GNU General Public License; 
> its popularity has led to eMule's codebase being used as 
> the basis of cross-platform clients aMule, JMule, xMule, 
> along with the release of many eMule mods (modifications of the original eMule) on the Internet.
>
> As of October 2023, it is the fifth most downloaded project on SourceForge, 
> with over 693 million downloads.
>
> Development was later restarted by the community as eMule Community; 
> the latest stable version is 0.70a.
