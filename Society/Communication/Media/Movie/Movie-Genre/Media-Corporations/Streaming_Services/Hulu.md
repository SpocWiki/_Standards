## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hulu** (, styled hulu in its logo) is an American subscription streaming media and content hub 
> within the Disney+ streaming service owned by The Walt Disney Company. 
> It was launched on October 29, 2007.
>
> Hulu was initially established as a joint venture between News Corporation and NBCUniversal, 
> Providence Equity, and later The Walt Disney Company, 
> serving as an aggregation of recent episodes of television series 
> from their respective television broadcasting. 
> 
> In 2010, Hulu launched a subscription service, initially branded as "Hulu Plus", 
> which featured full seasons of programs from the companies and other partners, 
> and un-delayed access to new episodes. 
> In 2017, the company launched Hulu with Live TV—an over-the-top live TV service 
> featuring broadcast programming channels.
>
> In 2011, Hulu launched its services in Japan, marking its first and only international expansion. 
> Three years later in 2014, Hulu Japan was acquired by Nippon TV 
> and spun off from its American counterpart.
>
> A beta hub of Hulu launched on Disney+ in the United States on December 6, 2023, 
> with a full release later followed on March 27, 2024. 
> The hub shares similarities with the Star hub 
> that was previously launched on Disney+ in February 2021 outside the U.S. as a substitute to Hulu.
