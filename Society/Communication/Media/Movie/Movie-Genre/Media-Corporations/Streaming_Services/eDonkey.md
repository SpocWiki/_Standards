> The eDonkey Network (also known as the eDonkey2000 network or eD2k) 
> is a decentralized, mostly server-based, peer-to-peer file sharing network 
> created in 2000 by US developers Jed McCaleb and Sam Yagan  
> that is best suited to share big files among users, and to provide long term availability of files. 
> 
> Like most sharing networks, it is decentralized, as there is no central hub for the network; 
> also, files are not stored on a central server but are exchanged directly between users 
> based on the peer-to-peer principle.
>
> The server part of the network is proprietary freeware. 
> There are two families of server software for the eD2k network: 
> the original one from MetaMachine, written in C++, closed-source and proprietary, and no longer maintained; 
> and eserver, written in C, also closed-source and proprietary, although available free of charge and for several operating systems and computer architectures. 
> The eserver family is currently in active development and support, 
> and almost all eD2k servers as of 2008 run this server software.
>
> There are many programs that act as the client part of the network. 
> Most notably, eDonkey2000, the original client by MetaMachine, closed-source but freeware, 
> and no longer maintained but very popular in its day; 
> and eMule, a free program for Windows written in Visual C++ and licensed under the GNU GPL.
>
> The original eD2k protocol has been extended 
> by subsequent releases of both eserver and eMule programs, 
> generally working together to decide what new features the eD2k protocol should support. 
> 
> However, the eD2k protocol is not formally documented (especially in its current extended state), 
> and it can be said that in practice 
> the eD2k protocol is what eMule and eserver do together when running, 
> and also how eMule clients communicate among themselves. 
> 
> As eMule is open source, its code is freely available for peer-review of the workings of the protocol. 
> Examples of eD2k protocol extensions are "peer exchange among clients", "protocol obfuscation" 
> and support for files larger than 4 gigabytes, etc. 
> The other eD2k client programs, given time, generally follow suit adopting these protocol extensions.
>
> eDonkey client programs connect to the network to share files.  
> eDonkey servers act as communication hubs for the clients, 
> allowing users to locate files within the network.  
> 
> Clients and servers are available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, 
> and other Unix-like operating systems.  
> By running an eDonkey server program on a machine connected to the Internet, 
> any user can add a server to the network.  
> As the number of servers and their addresses change frequently, 
> client programs update their server lists regularly.
