## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **ESPN+**+ is an American over-the-top subscription video streaming service 
> available in the United States, owned by the ESPN division of the Walt Disney Company, 
> in partnership with ESPN Inc., which is a joint venture 
> between The Walt Disney Company (which owns a controlling 80% stake) 
> and the Hearst Communications (which owns the remaining 20%). 
> 
> It is one of Disney's three flagship subscription streaming brands in the United States, 
> alongside [[Disney+]] and [[Hulu]], and operates using technology of Disney subsidiary BAMTech, 
> now known as Disney Streaming.
>
> ESPN+ is marketed as an add-on to ESPN's core linear networks, 
> with some of ESPN+'s content previously offered exclusively to cable subscribers 
> via ESPN3 and the ESPN app. 
> ESPN+ does not include access to these services, 
> as they continue to only be available through television providers. 
> Thus, some of ESPN's sports rights are not carried on ESPN+.
>
> Featured content on ESPN+ includes 
> - combat sports (including coverage of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Top Rank boxing), 
> - college sports, 
> - hockey (including 75 exclusive National Hockey League games per-season and all out-of-market games), 
> - soccer, 
> - golf (including PGA Tour Live and coverage of the PGA Championship), 
> - tennis, and 
> - cricket. 
> 
> Major League Baseball's out-of-market sports package, also operated through BAMTech, 
> is sold through the platform as an add-on. 
> The service also features archive content, ESPN original documentaries, 
> and access to premium content on ESPN.com.
