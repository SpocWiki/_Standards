## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **American Horror Story** (AHS) is an American horror anthology television series 
> created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for the cable network FX. 
> The first installment in the American Story media franchise, seasons of AHS 
> are mostly conceived as self-contained miniseries, 
> following a different set of characters in a new setting within the same fictional universe 
> (which the show occasionally utilizes for crossovers between seasons, 
> and shares with episodic spin-off American Horror Stories), 
> and a storyline with its own "beginning, middle, and end." 
> 
> Some plot elements of each season are loosely inspired by true events. 
> Many actors appear in more than one season, usually playing a new character 
> though sometimes as a returning character, and often playing multiple characters in a season. 
> 
> Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe have returned most frequently, 
> with each having appeared in nine seasons, followed by Frances Conroy and Denis O'Hare 
> who both appear in eight; Emma Roberts, Billie Lourd, and Leslie Grossman appear in six, 
> while other notable actors including Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, 
> Adina Porter, Finn Wittrock, and Jamie Brewer appear in five of the seasons.
>
> The first season, Murder House, takes place in Los Angeles, California, in 2011, 
> and centers on a family in a haunted house. 
> The second season, Asylum, takes place in Massachusetts in 1964 
> and follows the patients and staff of a criminally insane institution. 
> The third season, Coven, takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2013, 
> and follows a coven of witches and their enemies. 
> The fourth season, Freak Show, takes place in Jupiter, Florida, in 1952 
> and centers on an American freak show. 
> The fifth season, Hotel, takes place in Los Angeles, California, during 2015 
> and focuses on the staff and guests of a supernatural hotel. 
> The sixth season, Roanoke, takes place in North Carolina during 2014–2016 
> and focuses on an isolated farmhouse haunted by the deceased Roanoke colony.  
> The seventh season, Cult, takes place in Michigan, 
> and centers on a cult after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
> The eighth season, Apocalypse, features the Coven witches and the Murder House Antichrist. 
> The ninth season, 1984, takes place outside Los Angeles in the 1980s 
> and focuses on the staff of a summer camp reopening after a massacre. 
> The tenth season, Double Feature, focuses on a family in 2021 in Provincetown, Massachusetts 
> and the town's true inhabitants, and a group of camping students 
> in a conspiracy involving the extraterrestrials of Asylum. 
> The eleventh season, NYC, takes place in 1980s New York City, 
> and focuses on the killings of gay men and the emergence of a virus. 
> The twelfth season, Delicate, takes place in New York City in 2023-2024 
> and follows an actress who comes to believe that someone is going to great lengths 
> to stop her from fulfilling her dream of getting pregnant. 
> In January 2020, FX renewed the series through to season 13.
>
> Although reception to individual seasons has varied, 
> American Horror Story has largely been well received by television critics, 
> with the majority of the praise going towards the cast, particularly [[Jessica Lange]], 
> who won two [[../../../TV-Series/Emmy_Award|Emmy Awards]], a Golden Globe Award, 
> and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performances. 
> [[James Cromwell]] and [[Kathy Bates]] each won an [[Emmy Award]] for their performances, 
> while [[Lady Gaga]] won a Golden Globe Award. 
> The series draws consistently high ratings for the [[FX_network]], 
> with its first season being the most-viewed new cable series of 2011.
