> **Napster** was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application 
> primarily associated with digital audio file distribution. 
> 
> Founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, the platform originally launched on June 1, 1999. 
> Audio shared on the service was typically encoded in the MP3 format. 
> As the software became popular, 
> the company encountered legal difficulties over copyright infringement. 
> Napster ceased operations in 2001 after losing multiple lawsuits 
> and filed for bankruptcy in June 2002.
>
> The P2P model employed by Napster involved a centralized database 
> that indexed a complete list of all songs being shared from connected clients. 
> 
> While effective, the service could not function without the central database, 
> which was hosted by Napster and eventually forced to shutdown. 
> Following Napster's demise, alternative decentralized methods of P2P file-sharing emerged, 
> including [[Gnutella]], [[Kazaa]], Freenet, FastTrack, [[eMule]], and [[BitTorrent]].
>
> Napster's assets were eventually acquired by Roxio, 
> and it re-emerged as an online music store commonly known as Napster 2.0. 
> Best Buy later purchased the service 
> and merged it with its Rhapsody streaming service on December 1, 2011. 
> 
> In 2016, the original branding was restored when Rhapsody was renamed Napster. 
> In 2022, the Napster streaming service was acquired by two Web3 companies, 
> Hivemind and Algorand. Jon Vlassopulos was appointed as CEO.
