> Metropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction silent film directed by Fritz Lang 
> and written by Thea von Harbou in collaboration with Lang, 
> based on von Harbou's 1925 novel of the same name 
> (which was intentionally written as a treatment). 
> 
> It stars Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Brigitte Helm. 
> Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studio for Universum Film A.G. (UFA). 
> 
> Metropolis is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction film, 
> being among the first feature-length ones of that genre. 
> Filming took place over 17 months in 1925–26 
> at a cost of more than five million Reichsmarks, or the equivalent of about €21 million.
>
> Made in Germany during the Weimar period, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia 
> and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city master, 
> and Maria, a saintly figure to the workers, 
> to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes in their city 
> and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen, the city master. 
> 
> The film's message is encompassed in the final inter-title: 
> "The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart".
>
> Metropolis met a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it visually beautiful and powerful 
> – the film's art direction by Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut, and Karl Vollbrecht 
> draws influence from opera, Bauhaus, Cubist, and Futurist design, along with touches of the 
> Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs, the cathedral and Rotwang's house – 
> and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of being naïve. 
> 
> H. G. Wells described the film as "silly", and 
> The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction calls the story "trite" 
> and its politics "ludicrously simplistic". Its alleged communist message was also criticized.
>
> The film's long running time also came in for criticism. 
> It was cut substantially after its German premiere. 
> 
> Many attempts have been made since the 1970s to restore the film. 
> In 1984, Italian music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version 
> with a soundtrack by rock artists including Freddie Mercury, Loverboy, and Adam Ant. 
> 
> In 2001, a new reconstruction of Metropolis was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. 
> In 2008, a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. 
> 
> Footage from both this print and a second one archived in New Zealand 
> was restored and re-integrated into the film, 
> bringing it to within five minutes of its original running time. 
> This version was shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.
>
> Metropolis is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, 
> ranking 67th in Sight and Sound's 2022 critics' poll, and receiving general critical acclaim. 
> In 2001, the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register, 
> the first film thus distinguished. 
>
> On 1 January 2023, the film's American reserved copyright expired, 
> thereby entering the film into the public domain.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Metropolis** is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural area for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications.
>
> A big city belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which is not the core of that agglomeration, is not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it. The plural of the word is metropolises, although the Latin plural is metropoles, from the Greek metropoleis (μητρoπόλεις).
>
> For urban areas outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction on a smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis ("regio" for short) was introduced by urban and regional planning researchers in Germany in 2006.
