> **RoboCop** is a 1987 American science fiction action film directed by [[../Movie-Directors/Verhoeven,Paul]] and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. 
> The film stars [[Weller,Peter]], [[Allen,Nancy]], Daniel O'Herlihy, Ronny Cox, [[Kurtwood_Smith]], and [[Ferrer,Miguel]]. 
> Set in a crime-ridden Detroit in the near future, RoboCop centers on police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) 
> who is murdered by a gang of criminals 
> and revived by the megacorporation [[OCP(Omni_Consumer_Products)]] as the cyborg law enforcer RoboCop. 
> Unaware of his former life, RoboCop executes a campaign against crime 
> while coming to terms with the lingering fragments of his humanity.
>
> The film was conceived by Neumeier while working on the set of Blade Runner (1982), and he developed the idea with Miner. 
> Their script was purchased in early 1985 by producer Jon Davison on behalf of [[Orion_Pictures]]. 
> Finding a director proved difficult; Verhoeven dismissed the script twice because he did not understand its satirical content, 
> until he was convinced of its value by his wife. 
> Filming took place between August and October 1986, mainly in Dallas, Texas. 
> Rob Bottin led the special-effects team in creating practical effects, violent gore and the RoboCop costume.
>
> Verhoeven emphasized violence throughout the film, making it so outlandish that it became comical. 
> Censorship boards believed that it was too extreme, however, 
> and several scenes were shortened or modified to receive an acceptable theatrical rating. 
> RoboCop was a financial success upon its release in July 1987, earning $53.4 million. 
> Reviewers praised it as a clever action film with deeper philosophical messages and satire, 
> but were conflicted about its extreme violence. 
> The film was nominated for several awards, and won an Academy Award and a number of Saturn Awards.
>
> RoboCop has been critically reevaluated since its release, 
> and it has been hailed as one of the best films of the 1980s 
> and one of the greatest science fiction and action films ever made. 
> 
> The film has been praised for its depiction of a robot affected by the loss of humanity, 
> in contrast to the stoic and emotionless robotic characters of that era. 
> RoboCop has continued to be analyzed for its themes such as the nature of humanity, 
> personal identity, corporate greed and corruption, and is seen as a rebuke of the era's [[Reaganomics]] policies. 
> 
> Its success created a franchise: the sequels RoboCop 2 (1990) and RoboCop 3 (1993), 
> children's animated series, live-action television shows, video games, comic books, toys, clothing and other merchandise. 
> A remake was released in 2014.
