> 
> It is considered a classic within its genres and world literature. 
> It was originally serialised from March 1869 to June 1870 
> in Pierre-Jules Hetzel's French fortnightly periodical, the Magasin d'éducation et de récréation. 
> A deluxe octavo edition, published by Hetzel in November 1871, 
> included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou. 
>
> It was widely acclaimed on its release, and remains so; 
> it is regarded as one of the premier adventure novels 
> and one of Verne's greatest works, along with 
> - Around the World in Eighty Days, 
> - Journey to the Center of the Earth and 
> - Michael Strogoff. 
> 
> Its depiction of Captain Nemo's submarine, Nautilus, is regarded as ahead of its time, 
> as it accurately describes many features of modern submarines, 
> which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels. 
> 
> Verne was inspired by a model of the French submarine Plongeur, 
> which he saw at the Exposition Universelle in 1867.
