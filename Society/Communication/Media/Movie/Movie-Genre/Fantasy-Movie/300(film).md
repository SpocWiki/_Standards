> based on the 1998 comic book limited series of the same name by [[../Movie-Directors/Miller,Frank]] and Lynn Varley. 
> 
> The film, like its source material, is a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae 
> in the Greco-Persian Wars. The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), 
> who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) 
> and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. 
> As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. 
>
> The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). 
> Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, 
> placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy. 
> 300 was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique 
> to replicate the imagery of the original comics.
>

> The completed film then premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, 
> before being released in both conventional and IMAX 8 in the United States on March 9, 2007 
> and on home media on July 31, 2007. 
> The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and style 
> but criticized its historical inaccuracies, including its depiction of the Persians, 
> which some characterized as bigoted or Iranophobic. 
>

> and became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2007.

> Adventure, or Thriller Film and Best Director (for Snyder).
