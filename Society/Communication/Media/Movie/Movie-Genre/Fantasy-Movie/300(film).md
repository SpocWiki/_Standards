> 300 is a 2006 American epic historical action film directed by Zack Snyder, 
> who co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Michael B. Gordon, 
> based on the 1998 comic book limited series of the same name by [[../Movie-Directors/Miller,Frank]] and Lynn Varley. 
> 
> The film, like its source material, is a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae 
> in the Greco-Persian Wars. The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), 
> who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) 
> and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. 
> As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. 
>
> The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). 
> Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, 
> placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy. 
> 300 was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique 
> to replicate the imagery of the original comics.
>
> An unfinished cut of 300 premiered at the Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006. 
> The completed film then premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, 
> before being released in both conventional and IMAX 8 in the United States on March 9, 2007 
> and on home media on July 31, 2007. 
> The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals and style 
> but criticized its historical inaccuracies, including its depiction of the Persians, 
> which some characterized as bigoted or Iranophobic. 
> 
> Grossing over $456 million, the film's opening was the 24th-largest in box office history at the time, 
> and became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2007. 
> The film earned a leading ten nominations at the 34th Saturn Awards, winning two for Best Action, 
> Adventure, or Thriller Film and Best Director (for Snyder).
