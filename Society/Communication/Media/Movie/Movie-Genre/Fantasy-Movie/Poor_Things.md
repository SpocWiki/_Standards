It is a modification of [[../../books/Authors/Shelley,Mary]]s [[../../../../../../../_protect/Society/Communication/Media/Literature/Genres/Frankenstein|Frankenstein]] 
With many Allusions to the novel and its Metadata: 

Godwin is the Name of [[../../books/Authors/Godwin,William|Godwin,William]], Mary Shelleys Father, but the short form "God" also fits very much. 

In June 1812, Mary's father sent her to stay with the [dissenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenter "Dissenter") family of the [radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalism_(historical) "Radicalism (historical)") William Baxter, near [Dundee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee "Dundee"), Scotland. 

Duncan Weatherburn is manipulative and played by [[Ruffalo,Mark]]. 
[[Stone,Emma]] plays Bella Baxter/Victoria Bellingham. The last Name is taken from the Guest Family that [[../../books/Authors/Shelley,Mary|Mary Shelley]] was sent to. 

It shows how a woman can grow up rapidly and, unspoiled by societal pressure, 
become an independent person. 

Max McCandles is played by ???
