> **The Princess Bride**: S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure, The "Good Parts" Version 
> is a 1973 fantasy romance novel by American writer William Goldman. 
> 
> The book combines elements of comedy, adventure, fantasy, drama, romance, and fairy tale.  
> It is metafictionally presented as an abridgment of a longer work by the fictional S. Morgenstern, 
> and Goldman's commentary asides are constant throughout. 
> 
> It was originally published in the United States by Harcourt Brace, then later by Random House, 
> while in the United Kingdom it was later published by Bloomsbury.
>
> The book was adapted into a 1987 feature film directed by Rob Reiner, 
> starring [[../../Actor/US_Actor/Wright,Robin]] and [[Cary Elwes]].  
>
> William Goldman said, "I've gotten more responses on The Princess Bride 
> than on everything else I've done put togetherâ€”all kinds of strange outpouring letters. 
> Something in The Princess Bride affects people."
>
> When the original edition failed to sell well, author/editor Spider Robinson convinced Goldman 
> to let him excerpt the novel, namely the "Duel Scene", 
> in the anthology The Best of All Possible Worlds (1980). 
> Robinson believes this helped the novel reach the right audience. 
>
> In 2015, a collection of essays on the novel and the film adaptation was published 
> entitled The Princess Bride and Philosophy.
