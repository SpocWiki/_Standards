> The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) 
> is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film 
> directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. 
> It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of "Halloween Town", 
> who stumbles upon "Christmas Town" and schemes to take over the holiday. 
> 
> Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. 
> The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, 
> Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.
>
> The Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 
> while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. 
> 
> With the critical success of Vincent that same year, 
> Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film 
> or a half-hour television special, to no avail. 
> 
> Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, 
> and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. 
> Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; 
> Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label, 
> because the studio believed the film would be "too dark and scary for kids".
>
> The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, 
> and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. 
> The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, 
> particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. 
> 
> While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following 
> and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 
> 
> It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, 
> but lost to Jurassic Park. 
> The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures 
> and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.
>
> In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry 
> by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."
