> Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film 
> based on the 1986–1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name 
> co-created and illustrated by Dave Gibbons 
> (with co-creator and author Alan Moore choosing to remain uncredited). 
> 
> Directed by Zack Snyder from a screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse, 
> the film features Malin Åkerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino, 
> Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson. 
> 
> A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, 
> the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War, 
> as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigate the murder of one of their own 
> before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy, 
> while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.
>
> For nearly two decades from October 1987 until October 2005, 
> a live-action film adaptation of the Watchmen series became stranded in development hell. 
> Producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver began developing the project at 20th Century Fox, 
> later moving it to Warner Bros. Pictures, the sister company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics, 
> and hiring director Terry Gilliam, who eventually left the production 
> and deemed the complex comic "unfilmable". 
> 
> During the 2000s, Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Pictures, 
> Revolution Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce the film. 
> Directors David Hayter, Darren Aronofsky, and Paul Greengrass were attached to the project 
> before it was canceled over budget disputes. 
> In October 2005, the project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct. 
> Paramount remained as its international distributor, 
> whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States. 
> However, Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon's failure 
> to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios. 
> Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film's release, with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. 
> Principal photography began in Vancouver, in September 2007. 
> As with his previous film 300 (2006), Snyder closely modeled his storyboards on the comic 
> but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using green screens and opted for real sets instead.
>
> Following its world premiere at Odeon Leicester Square on February 23, 2009, 
> the film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres on March 6, 2009. 
> The film underperformed at the box office, grossing over $185.4 million worldwide 
> against a production budget between $130–138 million; 
> however, the film later found financial success at the home media markets. 
> Greg Silverman (former Warner Bros executive) said that the film did later become profitable.
>
> The film received mixed to positive reviews from fans and critics; the style was praised, 
> but Snyder was accused of making an action film 
> that lacked the thematic depth and nuance of the comic. 
> 
> Over the years, it had gained a cult following. 
> A DVD based on elements of the Watchmen universe was released, 
> including an animated adaptation of the Tales of the Black Freighter 
> comic within the story voiced by Gerard Butler and a fictional documentary titled Under the Hood 
> detailing the older generation of superheroes from the film's backstory. 
> 
> A director's cut with 24 minutes of additional footage was released in July 2009. 
> The "Ultimate Cut" edition incorporated the animated comic Tales of the Black Freighter 
> into the narrative as it was in the original graphic novel, 
> lengthening the runtime to 3 hours and 35 minutes, and was released on November 3, 2009. 
> The director's cut was better received than the theatrical release.
