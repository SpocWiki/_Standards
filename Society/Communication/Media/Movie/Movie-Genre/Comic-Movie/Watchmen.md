# [[Watchmen]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Watchmen** is a comic book limited series by the British creative team of writer Alan Moore, 
> artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins. 
> It was published monthly by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 
> before being collected in a single-volume edition in 1987. 
> 
> Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC 
> featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. 
> As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, 
> managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.
>
> Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, 
> of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and of making political commentary. 
> 
> Watchmen depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s 
> and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War 
> and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. 
> In 1985 the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, 
> freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed 
> and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. 
> The story focuses on the protagonists' personal development and moral struggles 
> as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero 
> pulls them out of retirement.
>
> Gibbons uses a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series 
> and adds recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. 
> 
> All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory 
> and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, 
> an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which one of the characters reads. 
> Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. 
> In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogues have parallels with others through synchronicity, 
> coincidence, and repeated imagery.
>
> A commercial success, Watchmen has received critical acclaim 
> both in the comics and mainstream press. 
> Watchmen was recognized in Time's List of the 100 Best Novels 
> as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. 
> 
> In a retrospective review, the BBC's Nicholas Barber described it as 
> "the moment comic books grew up". 
> 
> Moore opposed this idea, stating, "I tend to think that, no, comics hadn't grown up. 
> There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. 
> But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they'd ever been. 
> It wasn't comics growing up. 
> I think it was more comics meeting the emotional age of the audience coming the other way."
>
> After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film, 
> director Zack Snyder's Watchmen was released in 2009. 
> A video game series, Watchmen: The End Is Nigh, was released to coincide with the film's release.
>
> DC Comics published Before Watchmen, a series of nine prequel miniseries, in 2012, 
> and Doomsday Clock, a 12-issue limited series and sequel to the original Watchmen series, 
> from 2017 to 2019 – both without Moore's or Gibbons' involvement. 
> 
> The second series integrated the Watchmen characters within the DC Universe. 
> A standalone sequel, Rorschach by Tom King, began publication in October 2020. 
> A television continuation to the original comic, set 34 years after the comic's timeline, 
> was broadcast on HBO from October to December 2019 with Gibbons' involvement. 
> Moore has expressed his displeasure with adaptations and sequels of Watchmen 
> and asked it not be used for future works.
