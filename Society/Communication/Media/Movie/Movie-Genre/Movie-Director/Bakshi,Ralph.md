# [[Bakshi,Ralph]] 

> Ralph Bakshi (born 1938-10-29) is an American animator, filmmaker and painter. In the 1970s, he established an alternative to mainstream animation through independent and adult-oriented productions. 
> 
> Between 1972 and 1994, he directed nine theatrically released feature films, predominantly urban dramas and fantasy films, five of which he wrote. He has also been involved in numerous television projects as director, writer, producer and animator.
>
> Beginning his career at the Terrytoons television cartoon studio as a cel polisher, Bakshi was eventually promoted to animator and then director. He moved to the animation division of Paramount Pictures in 1967 and started his own studio, Bakshi Productions, in 1968. 
> 
> Through producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi made his debut feature film, [[Fritz_the_Cat]], released in 1972. 
> It was based on the comic strip by Robert Crumb 
> and was the first animated film to receive an X rating 
> from the Motion Picture Association of America, 
> and is the most successful independent animated feature of all time.
>
> Over the next 11 years, Bakshi directed seven additional animated features. 
> He is well known for such films as [[Wizards(1977)]], The [[Lord_of_the_Rings(1978)]], 
> [[American_Pop(1981)]], and [[Fire_and_Ice(1983)]]. 
> 
> In 1987, Bakshi returned to television work, 
> producing the series [[Mighty_Mouse]]: The New Adventures, which ran for two years. 
> 
> After a nine-year hiatus from feature films, he directed Cool World (1992), 
> which was largely rewritten during production and received poor reviews, 
> consequently being his last theatrical feature-length film to date. 
> Bakshi returned to television with the live-action film Cool and the Crazy (1994) 
> and the anthology series Spicy City (1997).
>
> During the 2000s, he focused largely on fine art and painting, 
> and in 2003, co-founded the Bakshi School of Animation with his son Eddie and Jess Gorell. 
> Bakshi has received several awards for his work, 
> including the 1980 Golden Gryphon for The Lord of the Rings at the Giffoni Film Festival, 
> the 1988 Annie Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Art of Animation, 
> and the 2003 Maverick Tribute Award at the Cinequest Film Festival.
