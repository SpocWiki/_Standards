> **Stanley Kubrick** (; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) 
> was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, and photographer. 
> 
> Widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, 
> his films were nearly all adaptations of novels or short stories, 
> spanning a number of genres and gaining recognition for their intense attention to detail, 
> innovative cinematography, extensive set design, and dark humor.
>
> Born and raised in New York City, Kubrick was an average school student 
> but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age; 
> he began to teach himself all aspects of film producing and directing after graduating from high school. 
> 
> After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
> he began making low-budget short films 
> and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. 
> This was followed by two collaborations with [[Douglas,Kirk|Kirk Douglas]]: the anti-war film Paths of Glory (1957) 
> and the historical epic film [[Spartacus,film]].
>
> In 1961, Kubrick left the United States due to concerns about crime in the country, 
> as well as a growing dislike for how Hollywood operated and creative differences with Douglas and the film studios. 
> 
> He settled in England, which he would leave only a handful of times for the rest of his life. 
> In 1978, he made his home at Childwickbury Manor, which he shared with his wife Christiane, 
> where he centralized the writing, research, editing, and management of his productions. 
> 
> This permitted him almost complete artistic control over his films, 
> with the rare advantage of financial support from major Hollywood studios. 
> His first productions in England were two films with Peter Sellers: 
> an adaptation of [[Lolita_(1962_film)]] and the [[../../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Cold_War|Cold War]] black comedy [[Dr.Strangelove(1964)]].
>
> A perfectionist who assumed direct control over most aspects of his filmmaking, 
> Kubrick cultivated an expertise in writing, editing, color grading, promotion, and exhibition. 
> He was famous for the painstaking care taken in researching his films and staging scenes, 
> performed in close coordination with his actors, crew, and other collaborators. 
> 
> He frequently asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a film, often confusing and frustrating his actors. 
> Despite the notoriety this provoked, many of Kubrick's films broke new cinematic ground 
> and are now considered landmarks. 
> 
> The scientific realism and innovative special effects in his science fiction epic [[2001-Space_Odyssey]] (1968) 
> were a first in cinema history, and the film earned him his only [[../../TV-Series/Academy_Award|Academy Award]] (for Best Visual Effects). 
> Filmmaker [[Spielberg,Steven|Steven Spielberg]] has referred to 2001 as his generation's "big bang" 
> and it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.
>
> While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—
> particularly the brutal A [[Clockwork Orange(1971)]], 
> which Kubrick withdrew from circulation in the UK following a media frenzy—
> most were nominated for Academy Awards, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical re-evaluations. 
> 
> For the 18th-century period film [[Barry Lyndon(1975)]], 
> Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Carl Zeiss for NASA to film scenes by candlelight. 
> 
> With the horror film The Shining (1980), 
> he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots, 
> a technology vital to his Vietnam War film [[Full Metal Jacket(1987)]]. 
> A few days after hosting a screening for his family and the stars of his final film, 
> the erotic drama [[Eyes Wide Shut(1999)]], he died from a heart attack at the age of 70.
