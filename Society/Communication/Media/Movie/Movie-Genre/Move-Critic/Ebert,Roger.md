> Roger Joseph Ebert ( EE-burt; June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013) was an American film critic, 
> film historian, journalist, essayist, screenwriter, and author. 
> 
> He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. 
> Ebert was known for his intimate, Midwestern writing style and critical views 
> informed by values of populism and humanism. 
> 
> Writing in a prose style intended to be entertaining and direct, 
> he made sophisticated cinematic and analytical ideas more accessible to non-specialist audiences. 
> Ebert frequently endorsed foreign and independent films he believed would be appreciated 
> by mainstream viewers, championing filmmakers like Woody Allen, Spike Lee, Werner Herzog 
> and Errol Morris, as well as Martin Scorsese, whose first published review he wrote. 
> 
> In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the [[../../Journalism/Pulitzer_Prize]] for Criticism. 
> Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun-Times said 
> Ebert "was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic," 
> and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him "the best-known film critic in America."
>
> Early in his career, Ebert co-wrote the Russ Meyer movie [[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]] (1970). 
> Starting in 1975 and continuing for decades, Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel 
> helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing 
> when they co-hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews, 
> followed by several variously named At the Movies programs 
> on commercial TV broadcast syndication. 
> 
> The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films. 
> They created and trademarked the phrase "two thumbs up," 
> used when both gave the same film a positive review. 
> They regularly appeared on numerous talk shows together 
> including Late Show with David Letterman. 
> After Siskel died from a brain tumor in 1999, Ebert continued hosting the show 
> with various co-hosts and then, starting in 2000, with Richard Roeper.
>
> In the early 2000s, Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the [[../../TV-Series/thyroid_gland]] and [[salivary gland]]s. 
> He required treatment that included removing a section of his lower jaw in 2006, 
> leaving him severely disfigured and unable to speak or eat normally. 
> However, his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued 
> to publish frequently online and in print until his death in 2013. 
> 
> His RogerEbert.com website, launched in 2002, remains online as an archive of his published writings. 
> Richard Corliss wrote, "Roger leaves a legacy of indefatigable connoisseurship 
> in movies, literature, politics and, to quote the title of his 2011 autobiography, Life Itself." 
> In 2014, [[Life Itself]] was adapted as a documentary of the same title.
