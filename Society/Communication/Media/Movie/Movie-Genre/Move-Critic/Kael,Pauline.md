> **Pauline Kael** (June 19, 1919 â€“ September 3, 2001) 
> was an American film critic who wrote for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1991. 
> Known for her "witty, biting, highly opinionated and sharply focused" reviews, 
> Kael's opinions often ran contrary to those of her contemporaries.
>
> One of the most influential American film critics of her era, 
> she left a lasting impression on the art form. 
> Roger Ebert argued in an obituary that Kael "had a more positive influence 
> on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades". 
> Kael, he said, "had no theory, no rules, no guidelines, no objective standards. 
> You couldn't apply her 'approach' to a film. With her it was all personal." 
> In a blurb for The Age of Movies, a collection of her writings for the Library of America, 
> Ebert wrote that "Like George Bernard Shaw, she wrote reviews that will be read for their style, humor 
> and energy long after some of their subjects have been forgotten." 
> Owen Gleiberman said she "was more than a great critic. 
> She reinvented the form, and pioneered an entire aesthetic of writing."
