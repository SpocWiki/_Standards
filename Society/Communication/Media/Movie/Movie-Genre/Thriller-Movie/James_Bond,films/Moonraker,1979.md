> Moonraker is a 1979 spy-fi film, the eleventh in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, 
> and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. 
> 
> The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, 
> it co-stars Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Corinne Cléry, and Richard Kiel. 
> 
> In the film, Bond investigates the vanishing of a Space Shuttle, 
> leading him to Hugo Drax, the owner of the shuttle's manufacturing firm. 
> 
> Along with astronaut Dr. Holly Goodhead, Bond follows the mystery 
> from California to Venice, Rio de Janeiro, the Amazon rainforest, and finally into outer space 
> to prevent a plot to wipe out the world population and repopulate humanity with a master race.
>
> The story was intended by author Ian Fleming to become a film even before he completed the novel in 1954; 
> he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had devised earlier. 
> The film's producers had originally intended to make For Your Eyes Only, 
> but chose Moonraker as a result of the resurgence of the science fiction genre, following the success of Star Wars, 
> and NASA's concurrent test flights of the Space Shuttle. 
> 
> Budgetary issues led to the film being shot primarily in France; 
> other locations included Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States. 
> The soundstages of Pinewood Studios in England, traditionally used for the series, 
> were only used by the special effects team.
>
> Moonraker had a high production cost of $34 million, more than twice as much as The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), 
> and it received mixed reviews. 
> However, the film's visuals were praised, 
> with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, 
> and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series at the time with $210.3 million worldwide, 
> a record that stood until 1995's GoldenEye.
>
> This was Bernard Lee's final outing as M before his death in January 1981.
