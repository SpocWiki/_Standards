> **The Man with the Golden Gun** is the twelfth and final novel in [[../Fleming,Ian]]'s James Bond series 
> and the thirteenth Bond book overall. 
> 
> It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 1 April 1965, eight months after the author's death. 
> The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series, leading to poor but polite reviews. 
> Despite that, the book was a best-seller.
>
> The story centers on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond, 
> who had been posted missing, presumed dead, after his last mission in Japan. 
> 
> Bond returns to Britain via the Soviet Union, 
> where he had been brainwashed to attempt to assassinate his superior, M. 
> 
> After being de-programmed by the MI6 doctors, 
> Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find and kill Francisco Scaramanga, the titular "Man with the Golden Gun".
>
> The first draft and part of the editing process was completed before Fleming's death 
> and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer. 
> 
> Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, 
> as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. 
> The publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to the writer and Bond aficionado Kingsley Amis 
> for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not used.
>
> The novel was serialised in 1965, firstly in the Daily Express and then in Playboy; 
> in 1966 a daily comic strip adaptation was also published in the Daily Express. 
> 
> In 1974 the book was loosely adapted as the ninth film in the Eon Productions James Bond series, 
> with Roger Moore playing Bond and Fleming's cousin, [[../../../Actor/British_Actor/Lee,Christopher]], as Scaramanga.
