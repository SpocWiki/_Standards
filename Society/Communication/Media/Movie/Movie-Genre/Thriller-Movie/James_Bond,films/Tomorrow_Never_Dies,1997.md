> **Tomorrow Never Dies** is a 1997 spy film, the eighteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions 
> and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as fictional MI6 agent James Bond. 
> 
> Directed by Roger Spottiswoode from a screenplay by Bruce Feirstein, 
> it follows Bond as he attempts to prevent Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), 
> a power-mad media mogul, from engineering world events to initiate World War III.
>
> The film was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. 
> It was the first Bond film made after the death of producer Albert R. Broccoli (to whom it pays tribute in the end credits) 
> and the last released under the United Artists label. 
> Filming locations included France, Thailand, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
>
> Tomorrow Never Dies performed well at the box office, grossing over $339 million worldwide, 
> becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1997 and earning a Golden Globe nomination despite mixed reviews. 
> While its performance at the U.S. box office surpassed that of its predecessor GoldenEye, 
> it was the only one of Brosnan's Bond films not to open at No. 1 at the box office, 
> as it opened the same day as Titanic, and finished at No. 2 that week.
