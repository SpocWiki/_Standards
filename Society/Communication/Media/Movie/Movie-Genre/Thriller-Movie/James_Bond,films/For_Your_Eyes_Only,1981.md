> and co-stars Carole Bouquet, Chaim Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Julian Glover.
>
> The twelfth film in the James Bond franchise produced by Eon Productions, For Your Eyes Only 
> was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. 
> 
> Although the script is principally based on two Ian Fleming short stories, "For Your Eyes Only" and "Risico", 
> some elements of the plot were also inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger 
> and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. 
> 
> The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system 
> while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, 
> a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents.
>
> After the science-fiction-focused Moonraker, 
> the producers wanted a return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. 
> 
> For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences, 
> rather than the fantasy narrative of Moonraker. 
> Filming locations included Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom, while underwater footage was shot in the Bahamas. 
> Sheena Easton performed the title theme song.
>
> For Your Eyes Only was released in the UK on 24 June 1981 and in the US two days later; 
> it received a mixed-to-positive critical reception. 
> The film's reputation has improved over time, 
> with reviewers praising the more serious tone in comparison to previous entries in the series. 
> The film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. 
> This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; 
> the company was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release.
