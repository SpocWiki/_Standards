>
> The film is based on Ian Fleming's 1956 novel of the same name 
> and is the second of four James Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton. 
> 
> The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring 
> and uncovering a plot by his old enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. 
> Bond has to stop the smuggling and Blofeld destroying Washington D.C. 
> and blackmailing the world with nuclear supremacy.

> and Shirley Bassey performed the title song. 
> 
> Locations included Las Vegas, California, and Amsterdam. 
> Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success and received positive reviews, 
> though some of the humor has become controversial in retrospect. 
> It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.
