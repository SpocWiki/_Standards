> It is based on the 1963 novel by Ian Fleming. 
> Following Sean Connery's decision to retire from the role after You Only Live Twice, 
> Eon selected George Lazenby, a model with no prior acting credits, to play the part of James Bond. 
> During filming, Lazenby announced that he would play the role of Bond only once. 
> Connery returned to portray Bond in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever.
>
> In the film, Bond faces Blofeld (Telly Savalas), who is planning to hold the world to ransom 
> by threatening to render all food plants and livestock infertile 
> through the actions of a group of brainwashed "angels of death". 
> Along the way Bond meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg).
>
> It is the only Bond film to have been directed by Peter R. Hunt, with this serving as his directorial debut, 
> who had served as a film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. 
> Hunt, along with producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, 
> decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. 
> 
> It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. 
> Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, 
> On Her Majesty's Secret Service was still one of the top-performing films of the year. 
> 
> Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time 
> and it is now regarded as one of the strongest entries in the series 
> as well as one of the most faithful adaptations of a Fleming novel. 
> The title of the book and film is a play on the phrase "On Her Majesty's Service".
