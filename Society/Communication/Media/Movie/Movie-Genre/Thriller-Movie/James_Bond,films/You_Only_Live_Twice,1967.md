> You Only Live Twice is a 1967 spy film and the fifth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, 
> starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. 
> It is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, 
> who later directed the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and the 1979 film Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore. 
> 
> The screenplay of You Only Live Twice was written by Roald Dahl, 
> and loosely based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name. 
> It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, 
> using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.
>
> In the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet-crewed spacecraft vanish mysteriously in orbit, 
> each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War. 
> Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators, 
> and comes face-to-face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. 
> The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously unseen. 
> SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, 
> implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.
>
> During the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, 
> but after one film's absence, he returned in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever 
> and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again. 
> 
> You Only Live Twice received positive reviews 
> and grossed over $111 million (equivalent to $1 billion in 2023) in worldwide box office. 
> 
> However, it was the first Bond film to see a decline in box-office revenue, 
> primarily owing to the oversaturation of the spy film genre from Bond imitators, 
> including a competing Bond film, Casino Royale, from Columbia Pictures (1967). 
> 
> The Bond series continued with On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969, 
> the first film without Sean Connery in the lead role.
