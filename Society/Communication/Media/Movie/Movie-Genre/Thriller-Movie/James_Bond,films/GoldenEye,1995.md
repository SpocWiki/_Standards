## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **GoldenEye** is a 1995 spy film, the seventeenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions,
>  and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. 
>  
>  Directed by Martin Campbell, it was the first in the series 
>  not to use any story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. 
>  
>  GoldenEye was also the first James Bond film not produced by Albert R. Broccoli, 
>  following his stepping down from Eon Productions and replacement by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli 
>  (along with Michael G. Wilson, although Broccoli was still involved as a consultant producer; 
>  it was his final film project before his death in 1996). 
>  
>  The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. 
>  In the film, Bond fights to prevent a rogue ex-MI6 agent (Sean Bean), 006, 
>  from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown.
>
> GoldenEye was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, 
> during which Timothy Dalton's contract for the role of James Bond expired 
> and he decided to leave the role, being replaced by Brosnan. 
> 
> M was also recast, actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. 
> The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond. 
> 
> Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his previous role, as Q. 
> It was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, 
> which provided a background for the plot. 
> 
> Principal photography for GoldenEye took place from January to June of 1995 
> in the UK, Russia, Monte Carlo, and Puerto Rico; it was the inaugural film production to be shot at Leavesden Studios. 
> 
> The first Bond film to use computer-generated imagery (CGI), 
> GoldenEye was also the final film in the career of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings, 
> and was dedicated to his memory.
>
> The film accumulated a worldwide gross of over US$356 million, considerably better than the entire 1980s Bond films, 
> without taking inflation into account. 
> 
> It received positive reviews, with critics viewing Brosnan as a worthy successor to Sean Connery’s portrayal as Bond. 
> It also received award nominations for Best Special Visual Effects 
> and Best Sound from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
