>
> Licence to Kill was the first Bond film to not use the title of an Ian Fleming story.

> and the short story "The Hildebrand Rarity", 
> interwoven with a sabotage premise influenced by Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo.

> principal photography took place on location in Mexico and the US, 
> while interiors were filmed at Estudios Churubusco instead of Pinewood Studios. 
>
