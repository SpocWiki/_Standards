> **Licence to Kill** is a 1989 spy film, the sixteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, 
> and the second and final film to star Timothy Dalton as the MI6 agent James Bond.

> who ordered an attack against Bond's friend and CIA agent [[Felix Leiter]] and the murder of Felix's wife after their wedding.
>
> Licence to Kill was the fifth and final Bond film directed by John Glen 
> and the last to feature Robert Brown as M and Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny. 
> It was also the last to feature the work of screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder 
> and producer Albert R. Broccoli, who all died in the following years.
>
> Licence to Kill was the first Bond film to not use the title of an Ian Fleming story. 
> Originally titled Licence Revoked, the name was changed during post-production 
> due to American test audiences associating the term with driving licence. 
> 
> Although the plot is largely original, it contains elements of the Fleming novel Live and Let Die 
> and the short story "The Hildebrand Rarity", 
> interwoven with a sabotage premise influenced by Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo.
>
> For budget reasons, Licence to Kill became the first Bond film shot entirely outside the United Kingdom: 
> principal photography took place on location in Mexico and the US, 
> while interiors were filmed at Estudios Churubusco instead of Pinewood Studios. 
> 
> The film earned over $156 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews but criticism for the darker tone.
