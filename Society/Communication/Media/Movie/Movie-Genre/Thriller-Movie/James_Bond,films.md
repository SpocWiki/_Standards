> The **James Bond** franchise focuses on the titular character, 
> a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, 
> who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. 
> 
> Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: 
> Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, 
> Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. 
> 
> The latest novel is With a Mind to Kill by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. 
> Additionally, Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, 
> and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.
>
> The character—also known by the code number 007 (pronounced "double-oh-seven")—
> has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strips, video games and film. 
> 
> The films constitute one of the longest continually running film series 
> and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, 
> making James Bond the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, 
> which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring [[../../Actor/British_Actor/Connery,Sean|Sean Connery]] as Bond. 
> 
> As of 2021, there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. 
> The most recent Bond film, No Time to Die (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; 
> he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. 
> 
> There have also been two independent Bond film productions: 
> - Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and 
> - Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's Thunderball, both starring Connery). 
> The James Bond franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. 
> Casino Royale has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series Climax!.
>
> The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, 
> with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. 
> 
> Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, 
> and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. 
> The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as "Bond girls".
