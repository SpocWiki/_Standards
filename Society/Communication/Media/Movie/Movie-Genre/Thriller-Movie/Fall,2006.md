The Images and Scenes are gorgeous! 

Tarsem Singh largely financed the film with his own funds, and paid members of the cast and crew on an equal basis rather than in more typical Hollywood fashion. The film was made over a period of four years and incorporates footage shot in 24 countries,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(2006_film)#cite_note-8) including India, Indonesia (Bali), Italy, France, Spain, Namibia, and China (PRC). Singh stressed the importance of on-location filming and lack of special effects, as he found that modern techniques would not age well in comparison. He only took advertising jobs in places that he wanted to do location scouting for, and flew cast members to shoot scenes for the film using the same crew as he did for commercials.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(2006_film)#cite_note-9) When shooting scenes of the blue city in [Jodhpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodhpur "Jodhpur"), Singh provided locals with blue paint to refresh the paint on their houses.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(2006_film)#cite_note-10) This alternative to post-production effects resulted in the vibrant blue of the city in the film. Another location, the contemporary South African mental hospital which represents an early 20th-century Los Angeles hospital (the principal setting throughout the film) remained operational (in a separate wing) during filming.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(2006_film)#cite_note-commentary-11)
