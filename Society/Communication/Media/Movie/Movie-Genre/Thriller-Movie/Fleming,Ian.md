> Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was an English writer, 
> best known for his postwar James Bond series of spy novels. 
> 
> Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., 
> and his father was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917. 
> Educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, 
> Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.
>
> While working for Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, 
> Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye 
> and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units: 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. 
> 
> He drew from his wartime service and his career as a journalist 
> for much of the background, detail, and depth of his James Bond novels.
>
> Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952, at age 44. 
> It was a success, and three print runs were commissioned to meet the demand. 
> 
> Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. 
> The novels centre around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. 
> 
> Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. 
> The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, 
> having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. 
> 
> Fleming also wrote the children's story Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang (1964) and two works of non-fiction. 
> In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming 14th on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".
>
> Fleming was married to Anne Charteris. 
> She had divorced her husband, the 2nd Viscount Rothermere, because of her affair with the author. 
> Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. 
> 
> Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. 
> Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. 
> Fleming's creation has appeared in film twenty-seven times, portrayed by six actors in the official film series.
