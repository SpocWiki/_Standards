> Frankenstein is a 1931 American Gothic pre-Code science fiction horror film 
> directed by James Whale, produced by Carl Laemmle Jr., and adapted from a 1927 play by Peggy Webling, 
> which in turn was based on [[../../books/Authors/Shelley,Mary|Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The [[../../../../../../../_protect/Society/Communication/Media/Literature/Genres/Frankenstein|Modern Prometheus]]. 
> 
> The Webling play was adapted by John L. Balderston 
> and the screenplay written by Francis Edward Faragoh and Garrett Fort, 
> with uncredited contributions from Robert Florey and John Russell.
>
> Frankenstein stars Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein (Victor Frankenstein in the novel), 
> an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant 
> in order to assemble a living being from body parts. 
> 
> The resulting creature, often known as Frankenstein's monster, is portrayed by [[../../Actor/British_Actor/Karloff,Boris]]. 
> The makeup for the monster was provided by Jack Pierce. 
> Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film's cast also includes Mae Clarke, John Boles, Dwight Frye, and Edward Van Sloan.
>
> Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, the film was a commercial success upon release, 
> and was generally well received by both critics and audiences. 
> It spawned a number of sequels and spin-offs, and has had a significant impact on popular culture: 
> the imagery of a maniacal "mad" scientist with a hunchbacked assistant 
> and the film's depiction of Frankenstein's monster have since become iconic. 
> 
> In 1991, the United States Library of Congress selected Frankenstein for preservation in the National Film Registry 
> as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
