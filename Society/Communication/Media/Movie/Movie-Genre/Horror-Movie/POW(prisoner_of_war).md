> for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, 
> such as isolating them from the enemy combatants still in the field 
> (releasing and repatriating them in an orderly manner after hostilities), 
> demonstrating military victory, punishing them, prosecuting them for war crimes, 
> exploiting them for their labour, recruiting them as their own combatants, 
> collecting military and political intelligence from them,
