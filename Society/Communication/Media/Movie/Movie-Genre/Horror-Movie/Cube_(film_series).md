> Cube is a Canadian science fiction horror film series. 
> The films were directed by Vincenzo Natali, Andrzej SekuÅ‚a, 
> Ernie Barbarash and Yasuhiko Shimizu respectively.
>
> The films are centered, with slight variations, on the same science-fictional setting: 
> a gigantic, mechanized cubical structure of unknown purpose and origin, 
> made up of numerous smaller cubical rooms, 
> in which most or all of the principal characters inexplicably awaken in the opening scenes. 
> 
> Each of these rooms has six heavy vault doors, one on each face of the cube, 
> which lead into adjacent, largely identical rooms, differing occasionally by colour of lighting. 
> Some of these rooms are "safe", while others are equipped with deadly booby traps 
> such as flamethrowers and razorwire. 
> In some cases it is possible to detect a trap by throwing an object into the room first, 
> although this method is not always reliable due to the trigger mechanism of certain traps.
>
> In each case, a group of strangers awakens in this mysterious structure, 
> without any knowledge of how or why they are there. 
> In order to escape from the prison, they must band together 
> and use their combined skills and talents to avoid the traps and navigate out of the maze, 
> while also trying to solve the mystery of what the cube is and why they are in it.
>
> An American remake, currently on hold, is in development at Lionsgate, 
> and a Japanese produced remake was released in 2021.
