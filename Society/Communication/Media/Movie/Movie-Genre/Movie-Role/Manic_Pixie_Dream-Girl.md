> A Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in fiction, 
> usually depicted as a young woman with eccentric personality quirks 
> who serves as the romantic interest for a male protagonist. 
> 
> The term was coined by film critic Nathan Rabin 
> after observing [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character in Elizabethtown (2005). 
> 
> Rabin criticized the type as one-dimensional, 
> existing only to provide emotional support to the protagonist, 
> or to teach him important life lessons, while receiving nothing in return. 
> 
> The term has since entered the general vernacular.
