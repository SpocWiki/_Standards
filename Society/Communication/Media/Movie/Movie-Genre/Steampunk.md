> **Steampunk** is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology 
> and aesthetics inspired by, but not limited to, 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery.  
> 
> Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American frontier, 
> where steam power remains in mainstream use, 
> or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
>
> Steampunk features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions 
> as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them — distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism 
> — and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. 
> 
> Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons, lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
>
> Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre. As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. The first known appearance of the term steampunk was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier. A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime.
>
> Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.
