## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Emma is a novel written by English author Jane Austen. 
> It is set in the fictional country village of Highbury 
> and the surrounding estates of Hartfield, Randalls, and Donwell Abbey, 
> and involves the relationships among people from a small number of families. 
> 
> The novel was first published in December 1815, although the title page is dated 1816. 
> As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns 
> and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian–Regency England. 
> Emma is a comedy of manners.
>
> Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, 
> "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like." 
> In the first sentence, she introduces the title character by stating 
> "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home 
> and a happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; 
> and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." 
> 
> Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; 
> she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; 
> she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; 
> and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.
>
> Emma, written after Austen's move to Chawton, 
> was her last novel to be published during her lifetime, 
> while Persuasion, the last complete novel Austen wrote, was published posthumously.
>
> The novel has been adapted for a number of films, television programmes, and stage plays.
