## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Marx Brothers were an American comedy team known for their anarchic humor, 
> rapid-fire wordplay, and visual gags. 
> 
> They achieved success in vaudeville, on Broadway, and in 14 motion pictures.  
> The core group consisted of brothers Chico Marx, Harpo Marx, and Groucho Marx; 
> earlier in their career, they were joined by younger brothers Gummo and Zeppo.  
> 
> They are considered by critics, scholars and fans to be 
> among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century, 
> a recognition underscored by the American Film Institute (AFI) 
> selecting five of their fourteen feature films to be among the top 100 comedy films 
> (with two in the top fifteen) and including them as the only group of performers 
> on AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classical Hollywood cinema.
>
> Their performing lives, heavily influenced by their mother, Minnie Marx, 
> started with Groucho on stage at age 14, in 1905.  
> He was joined, in succession, by Gummo and Harpo. 
> 
> Chico started a separate vaudeville act in 1911, and joined his brothers in 1912.  
> Zeppo replaced Gummo when the latter joined the army in World War I. 
> 
> The brothers performed together in vaudeville until 1923, 
> when they found themselves banned from the major vaudeville circuits 
> owing to a dispute with E. F. Albee.  
> 
> Failing in an attempt to produce their own shows on the alternate Shubert circuit, 
> they transitioned to Broadway, where they achieved significant success 
> with a series of hit musical comedies, including I'll Say She Is, The Cocoanuts, and Animal Crackers.
>
> In 1928, the Marx Brothers made a deal with Paramount Pictures 
> to appear in a screen version of The Cocoanuts, 
> which was filmed at Paramount's Astoria Studios 
> during the Broadway run of Animal Crackers. 
> 
> The Cocoanuts was released in 1929, 
> followed the next year by a film version of Animal Crackers (1930).  
> The success of these films made the brothers decided 
> to devote their careers to motion pictures. 
> 
> They moved to Los Angeles, where they starred in three more films for Paramount: 
> Monkey Business (1931), Horse Feathers (1932), and Duck Soup (1933).  
>
> When their Paramount contract expired following the production of Duck Soup, 
> Zeppo left the team and the Marx Brothers left Paramount. 
> Groucho, Chico and Harpo were signed by Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
> where they starred in  A Night at the Opera (1935), which they considered to be their best film.
>
> Shortly after filming began on their follow-up movie, A Day at the Races (1937), 
> Thalberg died unexpectedly at the age of 37. 
> While they continued to appear in films, they felt that the quality of their work as well as their interest in it, was waning.  
>
> After starring in Room Service (1938) for RKO Pictures, 
> they returned to MGM, for At the Circus (1939) and Go West (1940). 
> 
> The Marx Brothers announced that their next MGM film, The Big Store (1941), 
> would be their farewell picture. 
> 
> However, they returned to the screen in A Night in Casablanca (1946), 
> reportedly because Chico needed money. 
> 
> In 1949, they starred together in their final film, Love Happy; 
> originally intended as a solo vehicle for Harpo, 
> Chico, again in need of money, also ended up in the film. 
> After being informed that financing for the movie couldn't be obtained 
> unless all three Marx Brothers were in it, Groucho reluctantly agreed to appear in Love Happy.   
>
> Groucho went on to a successful career as host of the quiz show, You Bet Your Life, 
> while Harpo and Chico continued to make guest appearances on television and on the stage.
