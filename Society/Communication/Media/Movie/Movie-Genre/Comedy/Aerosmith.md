## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Aerosmith** is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. 
> The group consists of lead vocalist Steven Tyler, bassist Tom Hamilton, 
> drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford. 
> 
> Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, 
> has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, 
> and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. 
> Aerosmith is sometimes referred to as "the Bad Boys from Boston" 
> and "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band". 
> The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is sometimes referred to as the "Toxic Twins".
>
> Perry and Hamilton were originally in a band together, the Jam Band, 
> where they met up with Tyler, Kramer, guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; 
> in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. 
> 
> They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, 
> followed a year later by Get Your Wings. 
> The band broke into the mainstream with their next two albums, 
> - [[Toys in the Attic(1975)]] and 
> - [[Rocks(1976)]]. 
> [[Draw the Line]] and [[Night in the Ruts]] followed in 1977 and 1979, respectively. 
> Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, 
> including their first Top 40 hit "Sweet Emotion" 
> and the Top 10 hits "Dream On" and "Walk This Way". 
> 
> By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world 
> and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the "Blue Army". 
> Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the 
> departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively. 
> The band did not fare well 
> and the album [[Rock in a Hard Place(1982)]] failed to match previous successes.
>
> Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. 
> After a comeback tour, they recorded [[Done with Mirrors(1985)]], 
> which did not meet commercial expectations. 
> 
> It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group [[Run–D.M.C.]] on a remake of "Walk This Way", 
> and the band's multi-platinum album, [[Permanent Vacation(1987)]], 
> that they regained their previous level of popularity. 
> 
> In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music 
> from the multi-platinum albums [[Pump(1989)]], [[Get a Grip(1993)]], and [[Nine Lives(1997)]], 
> while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. 
> 
> Their biggest hits during this period included 
> - "Dude(Looks Like a Lady)", 
> - "Angel", 
> - "Rag Doll", 
> - "Love in an Elevator", 
> - "Janie's Got a Gun", 
> - "What it Takes", 
> - "Livin' on the Edge", 
> - "Cryin'", and 
> - "Crazy". 
> 
> The band also filmed popular music videos 
> and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. 
> In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit 
> with "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" from Armageddon's soundtrack 
> and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. 
> 
> Their comeback has been one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. 
> Additional albums Just Push Play (which included the hit "Jaded"), 
> Honkin' on Bobo (a collection of blues covers), and Music from Another Dimension! 
> followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012, respectively. 
> 
> In 2008, they released Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, 
> which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. 
> From 2019 to 2022, the band had a concert residency in Las Vegas, 
> which was interrupted from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
> After Tyler suffered (and ultimately failed to recover from) a vocal injury 
> in 2023 during the third date of their farewell tour, the band retired from touring in 2024.
>
> Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, 
> having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, 
> including over 85 million records in the United States. 
> With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, 
> they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group 
> and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. 
> They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, 
> nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, 
> and ten MTV Video Music Awards. 
> 
> They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, 
> and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, 
> on Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. 
> 
> In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, 
> and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.
