> The Office is a British mockumentary television sitcom first broadcast in the UK on BBC Two on 9 July 2001. 
> Created, written and directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, 
> it follows the day-to-day lives of office employees in the Slough branch of the fictional Wernham Hogg paper company. 
> Gervais also starred in the series as the central character, David Brent.
>
> When it was first shown on BBC Two, ratings were relatively low, 
> but it has since become one of the most successful of all British comedy exports. 
> As well as being shown internationally on BBC Worldwide and channels such as BBC Prime, BBC America, and BBC Canada, 
> it has been sold to broadcasters in over 80 countries, including ABC1 in Australia, The Comedy Network in Canada, TVNZ in New Zealand, and the pan-Asian satellite channel Star World, based in Hong Kong. 
> 
> It was shown in the United States on BBC America from 2001 to 2016, 
> and later on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim from 2009 to 2011.
>
> Two six-episode series were made, followed by a two-part Christmas special. 
> The show centres on themes of social clumsiness, the trivialities of human behaviour, self-importance and conceit, frustration, desperation and fame. 
> 
> The Office is considered to be one of the best shows of the 21st century and of all time.
