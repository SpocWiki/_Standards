>
> When it was first shown on BBC Two, ratings were relatively low, 
> but it has since become one of the most successful of all British comedy exports.

> it has been sold to broadcasters in over 80 countries, including ABC1 in Australia, The Comedy Network in Canada, TVNZ in New Zealand, and the pan-Asian satellite channel Star World, based in Hong Kong.

> Two six-episode series were made, followed by a two-part Christmas special. 
> The show centres on themes of social clumsiness, the trivialities of human behaviour, self-importance and conceit, frustration, desperation and fame. 
> 
> The Office is considered to be one of the best shows of the 21st century and of all time.
