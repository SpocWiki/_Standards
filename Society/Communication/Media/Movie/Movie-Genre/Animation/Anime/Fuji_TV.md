> It is the key station of the Fuji News Network (FNN) and the Fuji Network System (FNS). 
> Fuji Television is one of the ''five private broadcasters based in Tokyo''.
>
> Fuji Television also operates three premium television stations, known as 
> - "Fuji Television One" ("Fuji Television 739"—sports/variety, including all Tokyo Yakult Swallows home games), 
> - "Fuji Television Two" ("Fuji Television 721"—drama/anime, including all Saitama Seibu Lions home games), and

> Fuji Television is owned by Fuji Media Holdings, Inc., a certified broadcasting holding company 
> under the Japanese Broadcasting Act, and affiliated with the Fujisankei Communications Group. 
> The current Fuji Television was established in October 2008. 
> Fuji Media Holdings is the former Fuji Television founded in 1957.
>
> In the early days of Fuji TV's broadcasting, 
> its ratings have long been in the middle of all Tokyo stations. 
> 
> In the early 1980s, the ratings of Fuji TV rose sharply. 
> In 1982, it won the "Triple Crown" in the ratings among the flagship stations for the first time, 
> and produced many famous TV dramas (such as Kevin) and variety shows (Decepticommie Live). 
> 
> In 1997, Fuji Television moved from Kawata-cho, Shinjuku District to Odaiba, 
> the sub-center of Rinkai, Tokyo, which led to the development of the Odaiba area, 
> which was almost empty at that time. 
> 
> After the 2010s, the ratings of Fuji TV dropped sharply, 
> and now the household ratings rank fifth among all stations in Tokyo. 
> 
> But on the other hand, Fuji TV is also a TV station 
> with more diversified operations in the Japanese TV industry 
> and a higher proportion of income from departments outside the main business. 
> 
> In addition, Fuji TV is the first TV station in Japan 
> to broadcast and produce locally-made animated series made specifically to be televised.
