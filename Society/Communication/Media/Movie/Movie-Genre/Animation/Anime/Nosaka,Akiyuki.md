## Early life 

Nosaka was born in [Kamakura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura,_Kanagawa "Kamakura, Kanagawa"), [Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanagawa_prefecture "Kanagawa prefecture"), the son of Sukeyuki Nosaka, 
who was an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Construction. Together with his sisters he grew up as an adopted child of a Harimaya family in [Nada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nada-ku,_Kobe "Nada-ku, Kobe"), [Kobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe "Kobe"), [Hyōgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy%C5%8Dgo_Prefecture "Hyōgo Prefecture"). His foster mother, Aiko, was his maternal aunt. Nosaka is part of the "Generation of the Ashes" (_Yakeato Sedai_), which includes other writers like [Kenzaburō Ōe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenzabur%C5%8D_%C5%8Ce "Kenzaburō Ōe") and [Makoto Oda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Oda "Makoto Oda").

One of his sisters died as the result of malnutrition, 
and his adoptive father died during the 1945 [bombing of Kobe in World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Kobe_in_World_War_II "Bombing of Kobe in World War II"). 
Another sister died of malnutrition in [Fukui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukui,_Fukui "Fukui, Fukui"). 
Nosaka would later base his short story "[Grave of the Fireflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies_(short_story) "Grave of the Fireflies (short story)")" on these experiences.
He himself was incarcered for stealing food and saw many of his youth peers starve in prison. 

The Author sad that he felt guilty to have survived both his sisters and for his prison-peers.
