> **The Sting** is a 1973 American caper film. 
> Set in 1936, it involves a complicated plot by two professional grifters (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) 
> to con a mob boss (Robert Shaw). 
> The film was directed by George Roy Hill, 
> who had directed Newman and Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). 
> The screenplay, by David S. Ward, was inspired by real-life cons 
> perpetrated by brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff 
> and documented by David Maurer in his 1940 book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man.
>
> The film plays out in sections introduced by old-fashioned title cards, 
> drawn by artist Jaroslav "Jerry" Gebr in a style reminiscent of the Saturday Evening Post. 
> It is noted for its use of ragtime, particularly the melody "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin, 
> which was adapted (along with other Joplin (1868-1917) pieces) for the film by Marvin Hamlisch, 
> producing a Billboard-topping soundtrack and a top-10 single. 
> The film's success created a resurgence of interest in Joplin's work.
>
> Released on Christmas of 1973, The Sting was a critical and commercial success 
> and hugely successful at the 46th Academy Awards, where it won seven of its 10 Oscar nominations, 
> including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Original Screenplay; 
> Redford was also nominated for Best Actor. 
> The film rekindled Newman's career after a series of big-screen flops. 
> Regarded by the Writers Guild of America as having one of the best screenplays ever written, 
> The Sting was selected in 2005 for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry 
> of the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".  
> A sequel film, also written by Ward, was released in 1983.
