> A documentary film (often described simply as a documentary) 
> is a nonfiction motion picture intended 
> to "document reality, primarily for instruction, education or maintaining a historical record". 
> 
> The American author and media analyst Bill Nichols has characterized the documentary 
> in terms of "a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception 
> [that remains] a practice without clear boundaries".
>
> Research into information gathering, as a behavior, and the sharing of knowledge, as a concept, 
> has noted how documentary movies were preceded 
> by the notable practice of documentary photography. 
> 
> This has involved the use of singular photographs 
> to detail the complex attributes of historical events and continues to a certain degree to this day, 
> with an example being the conflict-related photography achieved by popular figures 
> such as Mathew Brady during the American Civil War. 
> 
> Documentary movies evolved from the creation of singular images 
> in order to convey particular types of information in depth, using film as a medium.
>
> Early documentary films, originally called "actuality films", 
> briefly lasted for one minute or less in most cases. 
> While faithfully depicting true events, these releases possessed no narrative structure per se 
> and were of limited interest. 
> 
> Over time, documentaries have evolved to become longer in length 
> and to include more categories of information. 
> Some examples are explicitly educational, while others serve as observational works; 
> docufiction movies notably include aspects of dramatic storytelling that are clearly fictional. 
> 
> Documentaries are informative at times, 
> and certain types are often used within schools as a resource to teach various principles. 
> Documentary filmmakers have a responsibility to be truthful to their vision of the world 
> without intentionally misrepresenting a topic.
>
> Social media organizations such as Dailymotion and YouTube, 
> with many of these platforms receiving popular interest, 
> have provided an avenue for the growth of documentaries as a particular film genre. 
> 
> Such platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility 
> given the ability of online video sharing to spread to multiple audiences at once 
> as well as to work past certain socio-political hurdles such as censorship.
