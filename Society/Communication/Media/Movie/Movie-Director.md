> A film director or filmmaker is a person who controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects 
> and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the film crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. 
> The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design 
> and all the creative aspects of filmmaking in cooperation with the producer.
>
> The film director gives direction to the cast and crew 
> and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. 
> Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget.
>
> There are many pathways to becoming a film director. 
> Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. 
> Other film directors have attended film school. 
> 
> Directors use different approaches. 
> Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, 
> while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. 
> 
> Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. 
> Other directors edit or appear in their films or compose music score for their films.
