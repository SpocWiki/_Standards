> Special effects (often abbreviated as F/X or simply FX) are illusions or visual tricks 
> used in the theater, film, television, video game, amusement park and simulator industries 
> to simulate the fictional events in a story or virtual world. 
> It is sometimes abbreviated as SFX, but this may also refer to sound effects.
>
> Special effects are traditionally divided into the 
> categories of mechanical effects and optical effects. 
> 
> With the emergence of digital filmmaking 
> a distinction between special effects and visual effects has grown, 
> with the latter referring to digital post-production and optical effects, 
> while "special effects" refers to mechanical effects.
>
> Mechanical effects (also called practical or physical effects) 
> are usually accomplished during the live-action shooting. 
> 
> This includes the use of mechanised props, scenery, scale models, animatronics, pyrotechnics and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds, making a car appear to drive by itself and blowing up a building, etc. 
> 
> Mechanical effects are also often incorporated into set design and make-up. 
> For example, prosthetic make-up can be used to make an actor look like a non-human creature.
>
> Optical effects (also called photographic effects) are the techniques in which 
> images or film frames are created photographically, 
> either "in-camera" using multiple exposure, mattes or the Schüfftan process 
> or in post-production using an optical printer. 
> An optical effect might be used to place actors or sets against a different background.
>
> Since the 1990s, 
> computer-generated imagery (CGI) has come to the forefront of special effects technologies. 
> 
> It gives filmmakers greater control, 
> and allows many effects to be accomplished more safely and convincingly 
> and—as technology improves—at lower costs. 
> 
> As a result, many optical and mechanical effects techniques have been superseded by CGI.
