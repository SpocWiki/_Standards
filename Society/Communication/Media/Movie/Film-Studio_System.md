> A studio system is a method of filmmaking 
> wherein the production and distribution of films 
> is dominated by a small number of large movie studios. 
> 
> It is most often used in reference to Hollywood motion picture studios 
> during the early years of the Golden Age of Hollywood from 1927 
> (the introduction of sound motion pictures) to 1948 
> (the beginning of the demise of the studio system), 
> wherein studios produced films primarily on their own filmmaking lots 
> with creative personnel under often long-term contract, 
> and dominated exhibition through vertical integration, 
> i.e., the ownership or effective control of distributors and exhibition, 
> guaranteeing additional sales of films through manipulative booking techniques 
> such as block booking.
>
> During the Hollywood Golden Age, eight companies constituted 
> the major studios that promulgated the Hollywood studio system. 
> 
> Of these eight, five were fully integrated conglomerates known as the original Big Five, 
> combining ownership of a production studio, distribution division, 
> and substantial theater chain, and contracting with performers and filmmaking personnel: 
> - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (owned by Loews Incorporated, owner of America's largest theater chain), 
> - Paramount Pictures, 
> - Warner Bros., 
> - 20th Century-Fox, and 
> - RKO Radio Pictures (the last of these five, which emerged in 1928). 
> Also at this time, two of the Little Three major-minors 
> (Columbia Pictures and Universal Pictures) were similarly organized, 
> though without more than small theater circuits, 
> and the third (United Artists) owned a small number of theaters 
> and had access to two production facilities 
> owned by members of its controlling partnership group, 
> but it functioned primarily as a backer-distributor, 
> financing independent productions and releasing their films. 
>
> The Walt Disney Company was founded in 1923 
> but it was an animation studio and did not own its own theaters, 
> so it was not considered a peer of the major studios. 
> 
> Disney did expand into live-action movies in the 1940s, 
> and by 1986 it grew to be considered one of a new "Big Six". 
> 
> Ironically, Disney is the only one of these studios that originated in the 1940s 
> and continuously operated as the same company to the present day, 
> as even those which survived to the 21st century such as Paramount and Warner Bros. 
> went through several mergers and restructurings.
>
> The studio system was challenged under the [[../../../Economics/Competition_Law|Antitrust law]]s in a 1948 Supreme Court ruling 
> which sought to separate production from the distribution and exhibition 
> and ended such practices, thereby hastening the end of the studio system. 
> 
> By 1954, with television competing for audience 
> and the last of the operational links between a major production studio 
> and theater chain broken, the historic era of the studio system was over.
