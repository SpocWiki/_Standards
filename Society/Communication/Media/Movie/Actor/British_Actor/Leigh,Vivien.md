> Vivien Leigh ( LEE; born Vivian Mary Hartley; 5 November 1913 – 8 July 1967), 
> styled as Lady Olivier after 1947, was a British actress. 
> 
> After completing her drama school education, 
> Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 
> and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). 
> 
> She then won the Academy Award for Best Actress twice, 
> for her performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) 
> and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), 
> a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. 
> 
> For the latter role, she also won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. 
> She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). 
>
> Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. 
> During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging 
> from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies 
> to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet and Lady Macbeth. 
> 
> Later in life, she performed as a character actress in a few films. 
> Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute 
> (AFI) ranked Leigh as the 16th-greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema. 
> 
> Also lauded for her beauty, Leigh 
> felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her 
> from being taken seriously as an actress. 
>
> At the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with 
> her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. 
> Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, 
> with Olivier often directing, and in three films. 
> 
> She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, 
> and for much of her life she had bipolar disorder, 
> as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, 
> which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately led to her death at age 53.
