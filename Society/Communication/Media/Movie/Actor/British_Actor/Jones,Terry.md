> Terence Graham Parry Jones (1 February 1942 – 21 January 2020) 
> was a Welsh actor, comedian, director, popular historian, writer 
> and member of the Monty Python comedy troupe.
>
> After graduating from Oxford University with a degree in English, 
> Jones and writing partner [[Palin,Michael|Michael Palin]] wrote and performed 
> for several high-profile British comedy programs, including [[Do Not Adjust Your Set]] 
> and The [[Frost Report]], before creating Monty Python's Flying Circus 
> with Cambridge graduates Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Eric Idle 
> and American animator-filmmaker Terry Gilliam. 
> 
> Jones was largely responsible for the program's innovative, surreal structure, 
> in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. 
> He made his directorial debut with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 
> which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films 
> [[Life of Brian]] and The [[Meaning of Life]].
>
> Jones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series [[Ripping Yarns]]. 
> He also wrote an early draft of Jim Henson's film [[Labyrinth]] 
> and is credited with the screenplay, though little of his work actually remained in the final cut. 
> 
> Jones was a well-respected medieval historian, having written several books 
> and presented television documentaries about the period, 
> as well as a prolific children's author. 
> 
> In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards 
> for his outstanding contribution to television and film. 
> After living for several years with a degenerative aphasia, 
> he gradually lost the ability to speak and died in 2020 from frontotemporal dementia.
