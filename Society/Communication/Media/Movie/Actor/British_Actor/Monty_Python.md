> Monty Python (also collectively known as the Pythons) 
> were a British comedy troupe formed in 1969 
> consisting of [[Chapman,Graham]], [[Cleese,John]], [[Gilliam,Terry]], [[Idle,Eric]], [[Jones,Terry]], and [[Palin,Michael]]. 
> 
> The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus, 
> which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974. 
> Their work then developed into a larger collection 
> that included live shows, films, albums, books, and musicals; 
> their influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music. 
> Their sketch show has been called "an important moment in the evolution of television comedy".
>
> Monty Python's Flying Circus was loosely structured as a sketch show, 
> but its innovative [[stream-of-consciousness]] approach and Gilliam's animation skills 
> pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. 
> 
> A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control 
> which allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. 
> 
> They followed their television work by making  the films [[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] (1975), [[Life of Brian]] (1979), and The [[Meaning of Life (1983)]]. 
> Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, 
> while it has coloured the work of the early editions of Saturday Night Live 
> through to absurdist trends in television comedy.
>
> At the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988, 
> Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. 
> 
> In 1998, they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute. 
> Holy Grail and Life of Brian are frequently ranked on lists of the greatest comedy films. 
> A 2005 poll asked more than 300 comedians, comedy writers, producers, and directors 
> to name the greatest comedians of all time, and 
> half of Monty Python's members made the top 50.
