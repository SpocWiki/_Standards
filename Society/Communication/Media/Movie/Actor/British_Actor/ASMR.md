> An autonomous sensory meridian response (**ASMR**) is a tingling sensation 
> that usually begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. 
> 
> A pleasant form of paresthesia, it has been compared with auditory-tactile synesthesia 
> and may overlap with frisson. 
> 
> ASMR is a subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by 
> "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin". 
> 
> It is most commonly triggered by specific auditory stimuli, 
> and less commonly by intentional attention control and visual stimuli.
>
> The term ASMR can also refer to media (usually audiovisual) meant to evoke this phenomenon, 
> with the sensation itself being informally referred to as "tingles".
