> Ingrid Bergman (29 August 1915 – 29 August 1982) was a Swedish actress. 
> With a career spanning five decades, Bergman is often regarded as 
> one of the most influential screen figures in cinematic history. 
> She won numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, 
> two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Award, 
> and a Volpi Cup. 
> She is one of only four actresses to have received at least three acting Academy Awards 
> (only Katharine Hepburn has four).
>
> Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and German mother, 
> Bergman began her acting career in Swedish and German films. 
> Her introduction to the U.S. audience came in the English-language remake of Intermezzo (1939). 
> 
> Known for her naturally luminous beauty, she starred in Casablanca (1942) as Ilsa Lund. 
> Bergman's notable performances in the 1940s include the dramas 
> For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Joan of Arc (1948), 
> all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; 
> she won for Gaslight. 
> She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock: Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Under Capricorn (1949).
>
> In 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli, 
> released after the revelation that she was having an affair with Rossellini; 
> that and her pregnancy before their marriage created a scandal in the U.S. 
> that prompted her to remain in Europe for several years. 
> 
> During this time, she starred in Rossellini's Europa '51 and Journey to Italy (1954), 
> the former of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. 
> The Volpi Cup was not awarded to her in 1952 because she was dubbed (by Lydia Simoneschi) in the version presented at the Festival; she was awarded posthumously in 1992, 
> and the prize was accepted by her son Roberto Rossellini. 
> She returned to Hollywood, earning two more Academy Awards 
> for her roles in Anastasia (1956) and Murder on the Orient Express (1974). 
> During this period she also starred in Indiscreet (1958), Cactus Flower (1969), 
> and Autumn Sonata (1978) receiving her sixth Best Actress nomination.
>
> Bergman won the Tony Award for Best Actress 
> in a Play for the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine (1947). 
> 
> She also won two Primetime Emmy Awards 
> for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie 
> for The Turn of the Screw (1960), and A Woman Called Golda (1982). 
> 
> In 1974, Bergman discovered she was suffering from breast cancer 
> but continued to work until shortly before her death on her sixty-seventh birthday in 1982. 
> 
> Bergman spoke five languages—Swedish, English, German, Italian, and French—and acted in each. 
> 
> In 1999, the American Film Institute recognized her as the fourth-greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.
