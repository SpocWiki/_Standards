> Greta Garbo (born Greta Lovisa Gustafsson; 18 September 1905 – 15 April 1990) 
> was a Swedish and American actress. 
> She was a premier star during Hollywood's silent and early golden eras. 
> Regarded as one of the greatest screen actresses of all time, 
> she was known for her melancholic and somber screen persona, 
> her film portrayals of tragic characters, and her subtle and understated performances. 
> In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo 
> fifth on its list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.
>
> Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of Gösta Berling. 
> Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, 
> chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. 
> She stirred interest with her first American silent film, Torrent (1926). 
> Garbo's performance in Flesh and the Devil (1926), her third movie in the United States, 
> made her an international star. 
> 
> In 1928, Garbo starred in A Woman of Affairs, which catapulted her to MGM's highest box-office star, 
> surpassing the long-reigning Lillian Gish. 
> Other well-known Garbo films from the silent era are 
> - The Mysterious Lady (1928), 
> - The Single Standard (1929), and 
> - The Kiss (1929).
>
> With Garbo's first sound film, Anna Christie (1930), 
> MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline "Garbo talks!" 
> That same year she starred in Romance and for her performances in both films 
> she received her first combined nomination 
> out of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. 
> By 1932 her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contracts 
> and she became increasingly selective about her roles. 
> She continued in films such as Mata Hari (1931), Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931), Grand Hotel (1932), Queen Christina (1933), and Anna Karenina (1935).
>
> Many critics and film historians consider her performance as 
> the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in Camille (1936) to be her finest 
> and the role gained her a third Academy Award nomination. 
> 
> However, Garbo's career soon declined 
> and she became one of many stars labelled box office poison in 1938. 
> Her career revived with a turn to comedy in Ninotchka (1939), 
> which earned her a fourth Academy Award nomination. 
> 
> Two-Faced Woman (1941), a box-office flop, was the last of her 28 films. 
> Following this commercial failure, she continued to be offered movie roles, 
> though she declined most of them. 
> Those she did accept failed to materialize, either due to lack of funds 
> or because she dropped out during filming. 
> In 1954, Garbo was awarded an Academy Honorary Award 
> "for her luminous and unforgettable screen performances".
>
> Over time, Garbo would decline all opportunities to return to the screen. 
> In her retirement, she shunned publicity, led a private life, 
> and became an art collector whose paintings included 
> works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pierre Bonnard and Kees van Dongen. 
> 
> Although she refused throughout her life to talk to friends about her reasons for retiring, 
> four years before her death, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman: 
> "I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. 
> There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio ... 
> I really wanted to live another life."
