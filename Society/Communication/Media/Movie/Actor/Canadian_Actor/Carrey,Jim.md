> and comedian known for his energetic slapstick performances. 
> 
> After spending the 1980s honing his stand-up comedy act 
> and portraying mostly supporting roles in films, Carrey gained wide recognition in 1990 
> when he was cast in the American sketch comedy television series 
> In Living Color (1990–1994). 
> 
> He broke out as a film star after starring in a string of box office hits 
> with [[Ace Ventura~Pet Detective]], The [[Mask(film)]], and [[Dumb and Dumber]] (all 1994), 
> which he followed up with [[Ace Ventura~When Nature Calls]] and [[Batman Forever]] (both 1995). 
> The success of these five films led to Carrey being

> beginning with The [[Cable Guy]] (1996).

>
> Although largely typecast as a comedic actor, Carrey has had success in dramatic roles. 
> His critically-acclaimed performances include Truman Burbank in The Truman Show (1998) 
> and Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon (1999), 
> winning Golden Globe Awards for each film.
