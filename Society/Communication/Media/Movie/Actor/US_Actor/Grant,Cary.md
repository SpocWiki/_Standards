> Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 – November 29, 1986) 
> was an English-American actor. 
> 
> Known for his blended British and American accent, debonair demeanor, 
> lighthearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing, 
> he was one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. 
> 
> He was nominated twice for the Academy Award, 
> received an Academy Honorary Award in 1970, 
> and received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981. 
> He was named the second greatest male star of the Golden Age of Hollywood 
> by the American Film Institute in 1999.
>
> Grant was born into an impoverished family in Bristol, 
> where he had an unhappy childhood marked by the absence of his mother 
> and his father's alcoholism. 
> 
> He became attracted to theatre at a young age when he visited the Bristol Hippodrome. 
> At 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. 
> After a series of successful performances in New York City, 
> he decided to stay there. 
> He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s 
> and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s.
>
> Grant initially appeared in crime films and dramas, such as Blonde Venus (1932) 
> and She Done Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown 
> for his performances in romantic screwball comedies such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), and The Philadelphia Story (1940). 
> These pictures are frequently cited among the greatest comedy films of all time. 
> Other well-known films in which he starred in this period were the adventure Gunga Din (1939), the dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), 
> and the dramas Only Angels Have Wings (1939), Penny Serenade (1941), and None but the Lonely Heart (1944), 
> the latter two for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
>
> During the 1940s and 1950s, 
> Grant had a close working relationship with director Alfred Hitchcock, 
> who cast him in four films: Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), To Catch a Thief (1955), and North by Northwest (1959). 
> For the suspense-dramas Suspicion and Notorious, 
> Grant took on darker, morally ambiguous characters, 
> both challenging Grant's screen persona and his acting abilities. 
> Toward the end of his career he starred in the romantic films Indiscreet (1958), Operation Petticoat (1959), That Touch of Mink (1962), and Charade (1963). 
> He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal 
> as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, 
> and in comedies was able to toy with his dignity without sacrificing it entirely.
>
> Grant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses 
> Virginia Cherrill (1934–1935), Betsy Drake (1949–1962), and Dyan Cannon (1965–1968). 
> He had daughter Jennifer Grant with Cannon. 
> He retired from film acting in 1966 and pursued numerous business interests, 
> representing cosmetics firm Fabergé 
> and sitting on the board of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
> He died of a stroke in 1986 at the age of 82.
