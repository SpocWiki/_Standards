> **Jurassic Park**, later also referred to as Jurassic World, is an American science fiction media franchise 
> created by Michael Crichton, centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs. 
> It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment bought the rights to Crichton's novel Jurassic Park before it was published. The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation. The film received a theatrical 3D re-release in 2013, and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Crichton's 1995 sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a 1997 film adaptation, also directed by Spielberg. Crichton did not write any further sequels in the series, although Spielberg would return as executive producer for each subsequent film, starting with Jurassic Park III (2001).
>
> In 2015, a second trilogy of films began with the fourth film in the series, Jurassic World. The film was financially successful, and was followed by Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) and Jurassic World Dominion (2022). The Jurassic World films were co-written by Colin Trevorrow, who also directed the first and third installments in the trilogy. Jurassic World Rebirth, a new film set after the preceding trilogy, is scheduled for release in 2025, without Trevorrow's involvement.
>
> Numerous video games and comic books based on the franchise have been created since the release of the 1993 film, and several water rides have been opened at various Universal Studios theme parks. Lego has produced several animated projects based on the Jurassic World films, including Lego Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar, a miniseries released in 2019. DreamWorks Animation also produced two animated series for Netflix, Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous (2020â€“2022) and Jurassic World: Chaos Theory (2024-present), both set during the Jurassic World trilogy.
>
> As of 2000, the franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The film series is also one of the highest-grossing of all time, having earned over $6 billion at the worldwide box office as of 2022. The original Jurassic Park was the first to surpass $1 billion, doing so during its 2013 re-release. This was followed by each installment in the Jurassic World trilogy.
