She later received the award playing Sally Bowles in the musical film Cabaret (1972), which brought her to international prominence. She starred in a string of films such as Lucky Lady (1975), New York, New York (1977), Arthur (1981), Rent-a-Cop (1988), and Stepping Out (1991).

From 1988 to 1990, she toured with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in Frank, Liza & Sammy: The Ultimate Event. Minnelli is known for her renditions of American standards and is known for her signature songs which include ("New York, New York", "Cabaret", and "Maybe This Time").
