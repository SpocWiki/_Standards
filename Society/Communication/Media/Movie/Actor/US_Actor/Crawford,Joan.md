> Joan Crawford (born Lucille Fay LeSueur; March 23, 1904–1908 – May 10, 1977) was an American actress. 
> She started her career as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway. 
> 
> Crawford was signed to a motion-picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. 
> Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her roles, Crawford launched a publicity campaign 
> and built an image as a nationally known flapper by the end of the 1920s. 
> 
> By the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. 
> Crawford often played hardworking, young women who find romance and financial success. 
> These "rags-to-riches" stories were well received by Depression-era audiences 
> and were popular with women. 
> 
> Crawford became one of Hollywood's most prominent movie stars 
> and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money. 
> By the end of the 1930s, she was labeled "box office poison".
>
> After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, 
> Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred Pierce (1945), 
> for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. 
> 
> In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, 
> through her marriage to company president Alfred Steele. 
> 
> After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors 
> but was forced to retire in 1973. 
> 
> She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s, 
> when her performances became fewer; 
> after the release of the horror film Trog in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. 
> She withdrew from public life and became increasingly reclusive until her death in 1977.
>
> Crawford married four times. Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Al Steele. She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother. Crawford's relationships with her two older children, Christina and Christopher, were acrimonious. Crawford disinherited the two and, after Crawford's death, Christina published the tell-all memoir Mommie Dearest.
