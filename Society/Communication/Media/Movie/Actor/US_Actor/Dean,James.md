> James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 – September 30, 1955) was an American actor. 
> 
> He became one of the most influential figures in Hollywood in the 1950s, 
> despite a career that lasted only five years. 
> His impact on cinema and popular culture was profound, 
> even though he appeared in just three major films. 
> - Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he portrayed a disillusioned and rebellious teenager, 
> - East of Eden (1955), which showcased his intense emotional range, and 
> - Giant (1956), a sprawling drama, have been preserved in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for their "cultural, historical, or aesthetic significance". 
> He was killed in a car accident at the age of 24 in 1955, 
> leaving him a lasting symbol of rebellion, youthful defiance, and the restless spirit.
>
> Dean was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination 
> for Best Actor for his role in East of Eden. 
> 
> The following year, he earned a second nomination for his performance in Giant, making him the only actor to receive two posthumous acting nominations. In 1999, he was honored by the American Film Institute, being ranked as the 18th greatest male film star from Golden Age Hollywood on their "AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars" list. Time magazine recognized Dean as one of the "All-Time Most Influential Fashion Icons."
>
> Dean's film roles and style had a strong impact on Hollywood, 
> capturing the spirit of 1950s youth and creating an enduring legacy that shaped American pop culture and defined rebellious, countercultural attitudes for generations.
