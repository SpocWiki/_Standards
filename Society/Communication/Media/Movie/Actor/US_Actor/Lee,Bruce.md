## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Bruce Lee (born Lee Jun-fan; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) 
> was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and philosopher. 
> He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy 
> which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—
> as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought. 
> 
> With a film career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, 
> Lee is regarded as the first global Chinese film star 
> and one of the most influential martial artists in the history of  cinema. 
> Known for his roles in five feature-length martial arts films, 
> Lee is credited with helping to popularize martial arts films in the 1970s 
> and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.
>
> Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, 
> Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. 
> His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), 
> tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), 
> and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). 
> 
> In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in 1961. 
> It was during this time in the United States that he began considering 
> making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. 
> He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of his home in Seattle. 
> After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, 
> he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach 
> International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. 
> He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, 
> where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
>
> His roles in America, including playing Kato in The Green Hornet, 
> introduced him to American audiences. 
> After returning to Hong Kong in 1971, 
> Lee landed his first leading role in The Big Boss, directed by Lo Wei. 
> A year later he starred in Fist of Fury, in which he portrayed Chen Zhen, 
> and The Way of the Dragon, directed and written by Lee. 
> He went on to star in the US-Hong Kong co-production Enter the Dragon (1973) 
> and The Game of Death (1978). 
> 
> His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films, all of which were commercially successful, 
> elevated Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, 
> sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. 
> The direction and tone of his films, including their fight choreography and diversification, 
> dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide. 
> With his influence, kung fu films began to displace the wuxia film genre—
> fights were choreographed more realistically, 
> fantasy elements were discarded for real-world conflicts, 
> and the characterisation of the male lead went from simply being a chivalrous hero 
> to one that embodied the notion of masculinity.
>
> Lee's career was cut short by his sudden death at age 32 from a brain edema, 
> the causes of which remain a matter of dispute. 
> Nevertheless, his films remained popular, gained a large cult following, 
> and became widely imitated and exploited. 
> 
> He became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, 
> based upon his portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films, 
> and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United States. 
> 
> Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, 
> including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, 
> including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. 
> Time named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.
