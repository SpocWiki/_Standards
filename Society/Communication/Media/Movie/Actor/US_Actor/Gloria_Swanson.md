> Gloria Mae Josephine Swanson (March 27, 1899 – April 4, 1983) 
> was an American actress. 
> 
> She first achieved fame acting in dozens of silent films in the 1920s
>  and was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, 
>  most famously for her 1950 turn in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, 
>  which earned her a Golden Globe Award.
>
> Swanson was born in Chicago and raised in a military family that moved from base to base. 
> Her infatuation with Essanay Studios actor Francis X. Bushman 
> led to her aunt taking her to tour the actor's Chicago studio. 
> The 15-year-old Swanson was offered a brief walk-on for one film 
> and eventually a stock-players contract, 
> beginning her life's career in front of the cameras. 
> Swanson left school, and was soon hired to work in California 
> for Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios comedy shorts opposite Bobby Vernon. 
>
> She was eventually recruited by Famous Players–Lasky/Paramount Pictures, 
> where she was put under contract for seven years and became a global superstar. 
> 
> She starred in a series of films about society, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, 
> including Male and Female (1919). 
> She continued as a successful movie star in The Affairs of Anatol (1921) and Beyond the Rocks (1922). She also starred in critically acclaimed performances 
> such as Zaza (1923) and Madame Sans-Gêne (1925).
>
> In 1925, Swanson joined United Artists 
> as one of the film industry's pioneering women filmmakers. 
> She produced and starred in the 1928 film Sadie Thompson, 
> earning a nomination for Best Actress at the first annual Academy Awards. 
> 
> Her sound film debut performance in 1929's The Trespasser 
> earned her a second Academy Award nomination. 
> Queen Kelly (1928–29) was a box-office disaster, but is remembered as a silent classic. 
> After almost two decades in front of the cameras, 
> her film success waned during the 1930s. 
> 
> Swanson received renewed praise for her return to the screen 
> in her role as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. 
> She made only three more films, but guest-starred on several television shows, 
> and acted in road productions of stage plays.
