## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Samuel George Davis Jr. (December 8, 1925 – May 16, 1990) 
> was an American singer, actor, comedian, dancer, and musician.
>
> At age two, Davis began his career in Vaudeville with his father Sammy Davis Sr. 
> and the Will Mastin Trio, which toured nationally, and his film career began in 1933. 
> 
> After military service, Davis returned to the trio and became a sensation following key nightclub performances at Ciro's (in West Hollywood) in 1951, including one after the Academy Awards ceremony. 
> 
> With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, at the age of 29, he lost his left eye in a car accident. 
> Several years later, he converted to Judaism, finding commonalities between the oppression experienced 
> both by black Americans and Jewish communities. 
> In 1958, he faced a backlash for his involvement with a white woman 
> at a time when interracial relationships were taboo in the U.S. 
> and when interracial marriage was not legalized nationwide until 1967.
>
> Davis had a starring role on Broadway in Mr. Wonderful with Chita Rivera (1956). 
> In 1960, he appeared in the Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. 
> He returned to the stage in 1964 in a musical adaptation of Clifford Odets's Golden Boy. 
> Davis was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance. 
> The show featured the first interracial kiss on Broadway. 
> In 1966, he had his own TV variety show, titled The **Sammy Davis Jr**. Show. 
> While Davis's career slowed in the late 1960s, his biggest hit, "The Candy Man", 
> reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1972, and he became a star in Las Vegas, 
> earning him the nickname "Mister Show Business". 
> 
> Davis's popularity helped break the race barrier of the segregated entertainment industry. 
> One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. "Handicap?" he asked. 
> "Talk about handicap. I'm a one-eyed Negro who's Jewish." This was to become a signature comment.
>
> After reuniting with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, 
> Davis toured with them and Liza Minnelli internationally, before his death in 1990. 
> He died in debt to the Internal Revenue Service, 
> and his estate was the subject of legal battles after the death of his wife. 
> 
> Davis Jr.'s final album, the country-influenced Closest of Friends (1982), was a departure from his usual musical style. 
> 
> Davis was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP 
> and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Primetime Emmy Award for his television performances. 
> 
> He was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1987, 
> and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. 
> In 2017, Davis was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.
