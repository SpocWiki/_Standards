## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pier Paolo Pasolini** (Italian: [ˈpjɛr ˈpaːolo pazoˈliːni]; 5 March 1922 – 2 November 1975) 
> was an Italian poet, film director, writer, actor and playwright. 
> He is considered one of the defining public intellectuals in 20th-century Italian history, 
> influential both as an artist and a political figure. 
> He is known for directing The Gospel According to St. Matthew, the films from Trilogy of Life 
> (The Decameron, The Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights) 
> and Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom.
>
> A controversial personality due to his straightforward style, 
> Pasolini's legacy remains contentious. 
> 
> Openly gay while also a vocal advocate for heritage language revival, 
> cultural conservatism, and Christian values in his youth, 
> Pasolini became an avowed Marxist shortly after the end of World War II. 
> 
> He began voicing extremely harsh criticism of Italian petty bourgeoisie 
> and what he saw as the Americanization, cultural degeneration, 
> and greed-driven consumerism taking over Italian culture. 
> 
> As a filmmaker, Pasolini often juxtaposed socio-political polemics with an extremely graphic and critical examination of taboo sexual matters. A prominent protagonist of the Roman intellectual scene during the post-war era, Pasolini became an established and major figure in European literature and cinema.
>
> Pasolini's unsolved and extremely brutal abduction, torture, and murder at Ostia in November 1975 prompted an outcry in Italy, where it continues to be a matter of heated debate. Recent leads by Italian cold case investigators suggest a contract killing by the Banda della Magliana, a criminal organisation with close links to far-right terrorism, as the most likely cause.
