> **There Will Be Blood** is a 2007 American epic period drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, loosely based on the 1927 novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Dano, Kevin J. O'Connor, CiarÃ¡n Hinds, and Dillon Freasier. The film follows silver miner-turned-oilman Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) as he embarks on a ruthless quest for wealth during the Californian oil boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

> Development on There Will Be Blood began after writer Eric Schlosser purchased the film rights to Sinclair's novel in 2004. It was acquired by Ghoulardi Film Company, Paramount Vantage and Miramax Films after Anderson completed the first draft of the film's screenplay. Day-Lewis immediately joined the project while Dano, who initially signed on for a smaller role, took on a starring role after replacing Kel O'Neill during filming. Principal photography began in June 2006 and lasted until that September, with filming locations including Los Angeles and Marfa, Texas. The film's music was composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.
