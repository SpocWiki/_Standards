## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Lolita is a 1962 black comedy-psychological drama film directed by Stanley Kubrick, 
> based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.
>
> The black-and-white film follows a middle-aged literature lecturer who writes as "Humbert" and has hebephilia. 
> He is sexually infatuated with young, adolescent Dolores Haze (whom he calls "Lolita"). 
> It stars James Mason as Humbert, Shelley Winters as Mrs. Haze, Peter Sellers as Quilty, 
> and Sue Lyon (in her film debut) as Dolores "Lolita" Haze.
>
> The novel was considered "unfilmable" when Kubrick acquired the rights around the time of its U.S. publication. 
> Owing to restrictions imposed by the Motion Picture Production Code (1934â€“68), 
> the film toned down the most provocative aspects, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. 
> Sue Lyon was 14 at the time of filming and played a 17-year-old, 
> whereas the Lolita of Nabokov's novel is just 12 years old when Humbert Humbert first meets her.
>
> Lolita polarized contemporary critics with its theme of child sexual abuse 
> but was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 35th Academy Awards. 
> Years after its release, Kubrick expressed doubt that he would have attempted to make the film 
> had he fully understood how severe the censorship limitations on it would be. 
> 
> Regardless, the film has since received critical acclaim. 
> In the late 1990s, British director Adrian Lyne again adapted the novel to the big screen.
