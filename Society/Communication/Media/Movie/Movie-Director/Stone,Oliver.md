> William Oliver Stone (born (1946-09-15)September 15, 1946) is an American filmmaker. 
> An acclaimed director, tackling subjects ranging from the Vietnam War 
> and American politics to musical biopics and crime dramas, 
> Stone has received numerous accolades including three Academy Awards and a BAFTA Award, 
> as well as a Primetime Emmy Award and five Golden Globe Awards.
>
> Stone was born in New York City and later briefly attended Yale University. 
> In 1967, Stone enlisted in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. 
> He served from 1967 to 1968 in the 25th Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions 
> and was twice wounded in action. 
> 
> For his service, he received military honors including a Bronze Star with "V" Device for valor, 
> Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster (to denote two wounds), an Air Medal 
> and the Combat Infantryman Badge. 
> His service in Vietnam became the foundation for the stark portrayals of war and its aftermath in his work.
>
> Stone began his career as a screenwriter for films such as for Midnight Express (1978), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Scarface (1983). He then rose to prominence as writer and director of the Vietnam War film dramas Platoon (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989), receiving Academy Awards for Best Director for both films, the former of which also won Best Picture. He also directed Salvador (1986), Wall Street (1987) and its sequel Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), The Doors (1991), JFK (1991), Heaven & Earth (1993), Natural Born Killers (1994), Nixon (1995), Any Given Sunday (1999), W. (2008) and Snowden (2016). Collectively, his films have grossed $1.3 billion worldwide. 
>
> Many of Stone's films focus on controversial American political issues during the late 20th century, and as such were considered contentious at the times of their releases. Stone has been critical of the American foreign policy, which he considers to be driven by nationalist and imperialist agendas. Like his subject matter, Stone is a controversial figure in American filmmaking, with some critics accusing him of promoting conspiracy theories.
