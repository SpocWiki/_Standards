> Elias Kazantzoglou (Greek: Ηλίας Καζαντζόγλου, IPA: [iˈli.as kazanˈdzoɣlu]; September 7, 1909 – September 28, 2003), 
> known as Elia Kazan ( EE-lee-ə kə-ZAN), was a Greek-American film and theatre director, 
> producer, screenwriter and actor, described by The New York Times as 
> "one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history".
>
> Born in Constantinople (now Istanbul) to Cappadocian Greek parents, 
> his family came to the United States in 1913. 
> 
> After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, 
> he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, 
> and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. 
> With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors' studio introduced "Method Acting" 
> under the direction of Lee Strasberg. 
> Kazan acted in a few films, including City for Conquest (1940).
>
> His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. 
> Kazan writes, "I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme." 
> His first such "issue" film was Gentleman's Agreement (1947), with Gregory Peck, 
> which dealt with antisemitism in the United States. 
> 
> It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. 
> It was followed by Pinky (1949), one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood 
> to address racial prejudice against African Americans. 
> A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, 
> received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. 
> Three years later, he directed Brando again in On the Waterfront, 
> a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. 
> It also received twelve Oscar nominations, winning eight. 
> In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's East of Eden, starring James Dean.
>
> A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony 
> as a "friendly witness" before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 
> at the height of the Hollywood blacklist. 
> 
> His decision to cooperate and name names 
> brought him strong negative reactions from many friends and associates. 
> His harshly anti-communist testimony "damaged if not shattered the careers of his former colleagues, 
> Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, both actors, and the playwright Clifford Odets". 
> 
> In his memoirs, Kazan writes that he and Odets had made a pact at the time 
> to name each other in front of the committee. 
> Kazan later justified his actions by saying he took 
> "only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong". 
> Nearly a half-century later, his 1952 HUAC testimony continued to cause controversy. 
> When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, 
> dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.
>
> Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. 
> Director Stanley Kubrick called him "without question, the best director we have in America, 
> [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses". 
> 
> Film author Ian Freer concludes that even "if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, 
> the debt Hollywood—and actors everywhere—owes him is enormous". 
> Orson Welles said "Kazan is a traitor ... [but] he is a very good director". 
> In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film A Letter to Elia as a personal tribute to Kazan.
