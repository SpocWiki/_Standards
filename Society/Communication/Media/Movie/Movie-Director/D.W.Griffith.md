> David Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. 
> Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, 
> he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film.
>
> To modern audiences, Griffith is known primarily for directing the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation. 
> One of the most financially successful films of all time 
> and considered a landmark by film historians, 
> it has been denounced for its degrading portrayals of African Americans, 
> its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan, and support for the Confederacy. 
> 
> The film led to riots in several major cities all over the United States 
> and the NAACP attempted to have it banned. 
> Griffith made his next film Intolerance (1916) as an answer to critics, 
> who he felt unfairly maligned his work.
>
> Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, 
> Griffith founded the studio United Artists in 1919 
> with the goal of enabling actors and directors to make films on their own terms, 
> as opposed to the terms of commercial studios. 
> 
> Several of Griffith's later films were successful, including Broken Blossoms (1919), Way Down East (1920), and Orphans of the Storm (1921), 
> but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. 
> He had made roughly 500 films by the time of The Struggle (1931), his final feature, 
> and all but three were completely silent.
