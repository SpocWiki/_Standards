## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Journalism** is the production and distribution of 
> reports on the interaction of events, facts, ideas, and people that are the "news of the day" 
> and that informs society to at least some degree of accuracy. 
> 
> The word, a noun, applies to the occupation (professional or not), 
> the methods of gathering information, and the organizing literary styles. 
>
> The appropriate role for journalism varies from country to country, 
> as do perceptions of the profession, and the resulting status. 
> 
> In some nations, the news media are controlled by government and are not independent. 
> In others, news media are independent of the government and operate as private industry. 
> In addition, countries may have differing implementations of laws 
> handling the freedom of speech, freedom of the press as well as slander and libel cases.
>
> The proliferation of the Internet and smartphones 
> has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. 
> 
> This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, 
> as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, 
> and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the 
> more traditional formats of newspapers, magazines, or television news channels. 
> 
> News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, 
> as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. 
> Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace 
> than the rate of growth for digital revenues.
