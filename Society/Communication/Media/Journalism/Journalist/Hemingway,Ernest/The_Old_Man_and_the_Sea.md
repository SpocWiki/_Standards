## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Old Man and the Sea is a 1952 novella by the American author [[../Hemingway,Ernest|Ernest_Hemingway]]. 
> 
> Written between December 1950 and February 1951, 
> it was the last major fictional work Hemingway published during his lifetime. 
> It tells the story of Santiago, an aging fisherman, and his long struggle to catch a giant marlin.
>
> Hemingway began writing The Old Man and the Sea  in Cuba 
> during a tumultuous period in his life. 
> 
> His previous novel Across the River and Into the Trees had met with negative reviews 
> and, amid a breakdown in relations with his wife Mary, 
> he had fallen in love with his muse Adriana Ivancich. 
> 
> Having completed one book in a planned "sea trilogy", 
> Hemingway began to write as an addendum a story about an old man and a marlin 
> that had originally been told to him fifteen years earlier. 
> He wrote up to a thousand words a day, completing the 26,531-word manuscript in six weeks.
>
> Over the following year, Hemingway became increasingly convinced 
> that the manuscript would stand on its own as a novella. 
> 
> Life magazine published the full novella in its September 1, 1952, issue. 
> Hemingway's publisher, Scribner's, released their first edition a week later on the 8th. 
> 
> Thanks to favorable early reviews and word-of-mouth, 
> popular anticipation was so high that both releases were heavily bootlegged. 
> The magazine sold a record 5.3 million copies in two days, 
> while Scribner's sold tens of thousands of copies. 
> 
> Translated into nine languages by the end of 1952, 
> The Old Man and the Sea remained on the New York Times bestseller list for six months. 
> In 1953, it received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, 
> and it was the only work explicitly mentioned 
> when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.
>
> Early reviews were positive, with many hailing what they saw as 
> a return to form for Hemingway after Across the River's negative reception. 
> 
> The acclaim lessened over time, as literary critics began 
> to think the initial reception overblown and over-enthusiastic. 
> 
> Whether The Old Man and the Sea is inferior or equal to Hemingway's other works 
> has since been the subject of scholarly debate. 
> 
> Thematic analysis has focused on Christian imagery and symbolism, 
> on the similarity of the novella's themes to its predecessors in the Hemingway canon, 
> and on the character of the fisherman Santiago.
