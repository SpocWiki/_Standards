> News Corp and 21st Century Fox are two companies that succeeded the original News Corp., which included Fox Entertainment Group and other broadcasting and media properties. The spin-out was structured so that 21CF was the legal continuation of the original News Corporation, with the new News Corp being a new company formed by a stock split. Since March 19, 2019, Fox Corporation, which holds 21st Century Fox's national broadcasting, news and sports assets, is also under the Murdoch family's control. On September 21, 2023, Rupert Murdoch announced he would step down as News Corp's chairman by November.
