> including The [[../Daily_Telegraph]] (UK), [[../Le_Figaro]] (France), and ABC (Spain).
>
> From 2004 to 2019, the newspaper also published a compact edition entitled Welt Kompakt, 
> a 32-page cut-down version of the main broadsheet targeted to a younger public. 
> The paper does not appear on Sundays, but the linked publication [[Welt am Sonntag]] takes its place.
