## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **New York Times** (NYT) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City. 
> The New York Times covers domestic, national, and international news, 
> and publishes opinion pieces, investigative reports, and reviews. 
> 
> As one of the longest-running newspapers in the United States, 
> the Times serves as one of the country's newspapers of record. 
> 
> As of 2023, The New York Times had 9.13 million total and 8.83 million online subscribers, 
> both by significant margins the highest numbers for any newspaper in the United States; 
> the total also included 296,330 print subscribers, 
> making the Times the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States, 
> following The[[Wall_Street_Journal]]], also based in New York City. 
> The New York Times is published by the New York Times Company; 
> since 1896, the company has been chaired by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, 
> whose current chairman and the paper's publisher is A. G. Sulzberger. 
> The Times is headquartered at The New York Times Building in Midtown Manhattan.
>
> The Times was founded as the conservative New-York Daily Times in 1851, 
> and came to national recognition in the 1870s with its aggressive coverage of corrupt politician William M. Tweed. 
> Following the Panic of 1893, 
> Chattanooga Times publisher Adolph Ochs gained a controlling interest in the company. 
> In 1935, Ochs was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who began a push into European news. 
> Sulzberger's son-in-law Arthur Ochs became publisher in 1963, 
> adapting to a changing newspaper industry and introducing radical changes. 
> The New York Times was involved in the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 
> which restricted the ability of public officials to sue the media for defamation.
>
> In 1971, The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, an internal Department of Defense document 
> detailing the United States's historical involvement in the [[../../_Standards/bio/Society/History/Modern_History/Vietnam_War|Vietnam War]], 
> despite pushback from then-president [[../../../../../Earth/Continent/America~North/US~President/Nixon,Richard|Richard Nixon]]. 
> In the landmark decision New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), 
> the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment guaranteed the right to publish the Pentagon Papers. 
> 
> In the 1980s, the Times began a two-decade progression to digital technology and launched nytimes.com in 1996. 
> In the 21st century, The New York Times has shifted its publication online amid the global decline of newspapers.
>
> The Times has expanded to several other publications, including The New York Times Magazine, 
> The New York Times International Edition, and The New York Times Book Review. 
> In addition, the paper has produced several television series, podcasts—including The Daily—
> and games through The New York Times Games. 
> 
> The New York Times has been involved in several controversies in its history. 
> The Times maintains several regional bureaus staffed with journalists across six continents, 
> and has received 137 [[Pulitzer_Prize]]s as of 2023, the most of any publication, among other accolades.
