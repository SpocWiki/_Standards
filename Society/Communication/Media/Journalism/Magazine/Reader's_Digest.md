> Reader's Digest is an American general-interest family magazine, 
> published ten times a year. 
> 
> Formerly based in Chappaqua, New York, it is now headquartered in midtown Manhattan. 
> The magazine was founded in 1922 by DeWitt Wallace and his wife Lila Bell Wallace. 
> For many years, Reader's Digest was the best-selling consumer magazine in the United States; 
> it lost that distinction in 2009 to Better Homes and Gardens. 
> 
> According to Media Mark Research (2006), Reader's Digest 
> reached more readers with household incomes of over $100,000 than 
> Fortune, The Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and Inc. combined.
>
> Global editions of Reader's Digest reach an additional 40 million people in more than 70 countries, via 49 editions in 21 languages. 
> The periodical has a global circulation of 10.5 million, making it the largest paid-circulation magazine in the world.
>
> It is also published in Braille, digital, and audio editions, 
> and in a large-type edition called "Reader's Digest Large Print." 
> 
> The magazine is compact: its pages are roughly half the size of most American magazines. 
> With this in mind, in summer 2005, 
> the company adopted the slogan "America in your pocket” for the U.S. edition. 
> In January 2008, however, it changed the slogan to "Life well shared."
