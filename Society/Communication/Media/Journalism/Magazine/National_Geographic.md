> National Geographic (formerly The National Geographic Magazine, 
> sometimes branded as Nat Geo) is an American monthly magazine 
> published by National Geographic Partners. 
> 
> The magazine was founded in 1888 as a scholarly journal, 
> nine months after the establishment of the society, but is now a popular magazine. 
> 
> In 1905, it began including pictures, a style for which it became well known. 
> Its first color photos appeared in the 1910s. During the Cold War, 
> the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of 
> the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain. 
> Later, the magazine became outspoken on environmental issues.
>
> Until 2015, the magazine was completely owned 
> and managed by the National Geographic Society. 
> 
> Since 2015, controlling interest has been held by National Geographic Partners.
> 
> Topics of features generally concern geography, history, nature, science, 
> and world culture. 
> 
> The magazine is well known for its distinctive appearance: 
> a thick square-bound glossy format with a yellow rectangular border. 
> Map supplements from National Geographic Maps are included with subscriptions, 
> and it is available in a traditional printed edition and an interactive online edition.
>
> As of 1995, the magazine was circulated worldwide 
> in nearly forty local-language editions 
> and had a global circulation of at least 6.5 million per month 
> including 3.5 million within the U.S., down from about 12 million in the late 1980s. 
> 
> As of 2015, the magazine had won 25 National Magazine Awards. 
> 
> In 2023, National Geographic laid off all staff writers 
> and announced they would stop U.S. newsstand sales in the next year. 
> 
> As of November 2024, its Instagram page has 280 million followers, 
> the third most of any account not belonging to an individual celebrity. 
> 
> The magazine's combined U.S. and international circulation as of June 30, 2024, 
> was about 1.65 million, 
> with its kids magazines separately achieving a circulation of about 500,000.
