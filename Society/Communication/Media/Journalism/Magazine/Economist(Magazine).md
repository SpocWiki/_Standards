> The Economist is a British news and current affairs journal 
> published in a weekly print magazine format and daily on digital platforms. 
> 
> Variously referred to as a magazine and a newspaper, it publishes stories on topics that include 
> economics, business, geopolitics, technology and culture. 
> 
> Mostly written and edited in London, it has other editorial offices in the United States 
> and in major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. 
> 
> The publication prominently features data journalism, 
> and has a focus on interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.
>
> Founded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson 
> to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. 
> 
> Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy 
> and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. 
> 
> Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, 
> adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, 
> art critique, book reviews, and technology features. 
> 
> The paper is recognisable by its fire engine red masthead (nameplate) 
> and illustrated, topical covers. 
> 
> Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.
>
> The editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Its extensive use of word play and high subscription price has linked the paper with a high-income elite readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations. In line with this, it claims to have an influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.
