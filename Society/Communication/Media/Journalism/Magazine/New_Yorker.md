> The New Yorker is an American magazine featuring 
> journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. 
> 
> It was founded on February 21, 1925, by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, 
> a reporter for The New York Times. 
> Together with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann, they established the F-R Publishing Company 
> and set up the magazine's first office in Manhattan. 
> 
> Ross remained the editor until his death in 1951, 
> shaping the magazine's editorial tone and standards, such as its robust fact-checking operation, 
> for which The New Yorker is widely recognized.
>
> Although its reviews and events listings often focused on the cultural life of New York City, 
> The New Yorker gained a reputation for publishing serious essays, long-form journalism, 
> well-regarded fiction, and humor for a national and international audience, 
> including work by writers such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, and Alice Munro. 
> 
> In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the magazine adapted to the digital era, 
> maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence, 
> including making its archives available on the Internet 
> and introducing a digital version of the magazine. 
> 
> David Remnick has been the editor of The New Yorker since 1998. 
> Since 2004, The New Yorker has published endorsements in U.S. presidential elections.
>
> The New Yorker is published 47 times annually, 
> with five of these issues covering two-week spans. 
> 
> It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, 
> such as View of the World from 9th Avenue, 
> its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric American culture, 
> its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews, 
> its rigorous fact checking and copy editing, 
> its investigative journalism and reporting on politics and social issues, 
> and its single-panel cartoons reproduced throughout each issue. 
> 
> According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, 
> The New Yorker, along with The Atlantic and Harper's Magazine, 
> ranked highest in college-educated readership among major American media outlets. 
> 
> It has won eleven Pulitzer Prizes since 2014, the first year magazines became eligible for the prize.
