> Mad (stylized in all caps) is an American humor magazine which was launched in 1952 
> and currently published by DC Comics, a unit of the DC Entertainment 
> subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. 
> 
> Mad was founded by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, 
> launched as a comic book series before it became a magazine. 
> It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, 
> as well as the cultural landscape of the late 20th century, 
> with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million 
> during its 1973â€“1974 circulation peak. 
> It is the last surviving strip in the EC Comics line, 
> which sold Mad to Premier Industries in 1961, but closed in 1956.
>
> Mad publishes satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format includes TV and movie parodies, and satire articles about everyday occurrences that are changed to seem humorous. Mad's mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, is usually on the cover, with his face replacing that of a celebrity or character who is being lampooned. From 1952 to 2018, Mad published 550 regular magazine issues, as well as scores of reprint "Specials", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. After AT&T merged with DC's then-owner Time Warner in June 2018, Mad ended newsstand distribution, continuing in comic-book stores and via subscription.
