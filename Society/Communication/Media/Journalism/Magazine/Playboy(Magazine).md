> **Playboy** (stylized in all caps) is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine, 
> available both online and in print. 
> It was founded in Chicago in 1953 by Hugh Hefner and his associates, 
> funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother.
>
> Known for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), 
> Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution 
> and remains one of the world's best-known brands, with a presence in nearly every medium. 
> 
> In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, 
> special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide, 
> including those by licensees, such as Dirk Steenekamp's DHS Media Group.
>
> The magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by novelists such as 
> Arthur C. Clarke, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse, Roald Dahl, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. 
> 
> With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for cartoonists such as 
> Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Jules Feiffer, Harvey Kurtzman, Shel Silverstein, Doug Sneyd, Erich Sokol, Roy Raymonde, Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson.  
> 
> Art Paul designed the bunny logo.  
> Leroy Neiman drew the Femlin characters for Playboy jokes.  
> Patrick Nagel painted the headers for Playboy Forum and other sections.
>
> Playboy features monthly interviews of public figures, such as 
> artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes, and race car drivers. 
> 
> The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, 
> although it often interviews conservative celebrities.
>
> After a year-long removal of most nude photos in Playboy magazine, 
> the Marchâ€“April 2017 issue brought back nudity.
