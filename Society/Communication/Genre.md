> **Genre** (French for 'kind, sort') is any style or form of communication 
> in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) 
> with socially agreed-upon conventions developed over time. 
> 
> In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, 
> or other forms of art or entertainment, based on some set of stylistic criteria, 
> as in literary genres, film genres, music genres, comics genres, etc. 
> 
> Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. 
> 
> Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, 
> but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. 
> Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility. 
> The proper use of a specific genre is important for a successful transfer of information (media-adequacy).
>
> Critical discussion of genre perhaps began with a classification system for ancient Greek literature, 
> as set out in Aristotle's Poetics. 
> For Aristotle, poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had specific features 
> that supported appropriate content of each genre. 
> 
> Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, for example, 
> and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.
>
> The academic discipline about genres is called genre studies (or genre theory).
>
> Genres proliferate and develop beyond Aristotle's classificationsâ€” 
> in response to changes in audiences and creators. 
> 
> Genre has become a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictability through artistic expression. 
> Given that art is often a response to a social state, in that people write, paint, sing, dance, 
> and otherwise produce art about what they know about, 
> the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.
>
> Among non-Western approaches, the five-category Cinematic Taxonomy proposed by Alireza Kaveh 
> distinguishes genre from adjacent concepts such as style, format, medium, and tradition.
