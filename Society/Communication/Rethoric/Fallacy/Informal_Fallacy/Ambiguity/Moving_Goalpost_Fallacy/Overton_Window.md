> The **Overton window** is the range of subjects and arguments 
> politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time. 
> It is also known as the window of discourse. 
> 
> The key to the concept is that the window changes over time; it can shift, or shrink or expand. It exemplifies "the slow evolution of societal values and norms".
> 
> The term is named after the American policy analyst 
> and former senior vice president at Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Joseph Overton, 
> who proposed that the political viability of an idea depends mainly on 
> whether it falls within an acceptability range, 
> rather than on the individual preferences of politicians using the term or concept. 
> 
> According to Overton, the window frames 
> the range of policies that a politician may recommend without appearing too extreme, 
> in order to gain or keep public office given the climate of public opinion at that particular time.
