> An **Irrelevant conclusion**, also known as ignoratio elenchi (Latin for 'ignoring refutation') 
> or missing the point, is the informal fallacy of 
> presenting an argument whose conclusion fails to address the issue in question. 
> It falls into the broad class of relevance fallacies.
> 
> The irrelevant conclusion should not be confused with formal fallacy, 
> an argument whose conclusion does not follow from its premises; instead, it is that 
> **despite its formal consistency it is not relevant to the subject** being talked about.
