> **Ambiguity** is a state in which the meaning of a phrase, statement, situation, or resolution 
> is not explicitly defined, making for **several plausible interpretations**. 
> 
> It arises when available information **lacks sufficient context** or a shared frame, 
> so people cannot reliably determine what the problem is, what matters, what causes what, or what solution would count as correct. 
> 
> As a result, interpretation depends heavily on 
> prior experience, framing, assumptions, and imagination.
> 
> An outcome of ambiguity is uncertainty, but uncertainty itself refers to 
> a state in which outcomes or meanings are known 
> but their likelihood, stability, or implications cannot be reliably assessed. 
> 
> Ambiguity is not simply the absence of information. 
> It is the lack of meaning and direction caused by insufficient context and unclear framing, 
> which obstructs the ability to determine what counts as a valid interpretation or resolution. 
> The prefix ambi- reflects the idea of “two” or “multiple,” as in multiple possible meanings.
> 
> The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness. 
> 
> In ambiguity, multiple distinct interpretations compete 
> because the frame of meaning is unclear 
> and is shaped by personal history and mental models. 
> 
> With **vagueness**, in contrast, the general interpretation is often understood, 
> but the boundaries are fuzzy, 
> so it is difficult to specify the meaning at the desired level of **precision**.
