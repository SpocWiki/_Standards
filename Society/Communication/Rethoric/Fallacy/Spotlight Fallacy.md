## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In statistics, sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that 
> some members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others. 
> 
> It results in a biased sample of a population (or non-human factors) 
> in which all individuals, or instances, were not equally likely to have been selected.  
> 
> If this is not accounted for, results can be erroneously attributed to the phenomenon under study 
> rather than to the method of sampling. 
>
> Medical sources sometimes refer to sampling bias as ascertainment bias. 
> Ascertainment bias has basically the same definition, 
> but is still sometimes classified as a separate type of bias.
