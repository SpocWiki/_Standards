> **Eclecticism** is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly 
> to a single paradigm or set of assumptions, 
> but instead draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas 
> to gain complementary insights into a subject, 
> or applies different theories in particular cases. 
> However, this is often without conventions or rules 
> dictating how or which theories were combined.
>
> It can sometimes seem inelegant or lacking in simplicity, 
> and eclectics are sometimes criticized for lack of consistency in their thinking. 
> It is, however, common in many fields of study. 
> For example, most psychologists accept certain aspects of behaviorism, 
> but do not attempt to use the theory to explain all aspects of human behavior.
>
> Eclecticism in ethics, philosophy, politics, and religion 
> is often compared to [[Syncretism]], but the two concepts 
> differ in their approach to combining elements from different traditions. 
> 
> While syncretism in religion involves the merging or 
> assimilation of several distinct traditions into a new, unified system, 
> eclecticism adopts elements from various systems 
> without necessarily integrating them into a single cohesive framework. 
> 
> This distinction allows for a broader, more inclusive approach in eclecticism, 
> where the selection is based on individual merit or preference 
> rather than an attempt to create a new unified tradition.
