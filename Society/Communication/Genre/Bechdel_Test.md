> The Bechdel test (BEK-dəl), also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, 
> is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. 
> 
> The test asks whether a work features at least two women 
> who have a conversation about something other than a man. 
> Some versions of the test also require that those two women have names.
>
> A work of fiction passing or failing the test 
> does not necessarily indicate the overall representation of women in the work. 
> Instead, the test is used as an indicator of the active presence (or lack thereof) of women in fiction, 
> and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction.
>
> The test is named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, 
> in whose 1985 comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For the test first appeared. 
> 
> Bechdel credited the idea to her friend Liz Wallace and the writings of Virginia Woolf. 
> Originally meant as "a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper", according to Bechdel, 
> the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, 
> as a number of variants and tests inspired by it emerged.
