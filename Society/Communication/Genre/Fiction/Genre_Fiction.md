> In the book-trade, **Genre fiction**, also known as formula fiction, or commercial fiction, 
> encompasses fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre 
> in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.  
> 
> These labels commonly imply that this type of fiction places more value on plot and entertainment 
> than on character development, philosophical themes, or artistic depth. 
> This distinguishes genre fiction from literary fiction.
>
> The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction and horrorâ€”as well as perhaps Western, inspirational and historical fiction.
>
> Slipstream genre is sometimes thought to be in between genre and non-genre fiction.
