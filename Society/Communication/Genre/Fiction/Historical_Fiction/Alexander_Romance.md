> The **Alexander Romance**, once described as "antiquity's most successful novel", 
> is an account of the life and exploits of Alexander the Great. 
> 
> The Romance describes Alexander the Great from his birth, 
> to his succession of the throne of Macedon, 
> his conquests including that of the Persian Empire, and finally his death. 
> 
> Although constructed around an historical core, the romance is mostly fantastical, 
> including many miraculous tales and encounters with mythical creatures 
> such as sirens or centaurs. 
> 
> In this context, the term Romance refers not to the meaning of the word in modern times 
> but in the Old French sense of a novel or roman, 
> a "lengthy prose narrative of a complex and fictional character" 
> (although Alexander's historicity did not deter ancient authors from using this term).
>
> It was widely copied and translated, 
> accruing various legends and fantastical elements at different stages. 
> 
> The original version was composed in Ancient Greek some time before 338 AD, 
> when a Latin translation was made, although the exact date is unknown. 
> Some manuscripts pseudonymously attribute the texts authorship 
> to Alexander's court historian Callisthenes, and 
> so the author is commonly called Pseudo-Callisthenes.
>
> In premodern times, the Alexander Romance underwent more than 100 translations, 
> elaborations, and derivations in 25 languages, 
> including almost all European vernaculars 
> as well as in every language from the Islamicized regions of Asia and Africa, 
> from Mali to Malaysia. 
> Some of the more notable translations were made into Coptic, Ge'ez, Middle Persian, 
> Byzantine Greek, Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Syriac, and Hebrew. 
> Owing to the great variety of distinct works derived from the original Greek romance, 
> the "Alexander romance" is sometimes treated as a literary genre, instead of a single work.
