## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Folklore** is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people, culture or subculture. 
> This includes oral traditions such as tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, 
> and other oral traditions. 
> 
> This also includes material culture, such as traditional building styles common to the group. 
> Folklore also encompasses customary lore, taking actions for folk beliefs, including folk religion, 
> and the forms and rituals of celebrations such as festivals, weddings, folk dances, and initiation rites. 
>
> Each one of these, either singly or in combination, 
> is considered a folklore artifact or traditional cultural expression. 
> Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts 
> from one region to another or from one generation to the next. 
> 
> Folklore is not something one can typically gain from a formal school curriculum or study in the fine arts. 
> Instead, these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another, 
> either through verbal instruction or demonstration.
>
> The academic study of folklore is called folklore studies or folkloristics, 
> and it can be explored at the undergraduate, graduate, and Ph.D. levels.
