  - Ten Commandments" for detective stories
---


Ronald Knox, a British author and clergyman, 
was one of the prominent figures in the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. 
He established the "Ten Commandments" (also known as the "Decalogue") 
for writing detective fiction, 
aiming to ensure fairness to the reader and maintain the integrity of the genre. 
These rules were designed to prevent unfair tricks 
and ensure that the detective story was a solvable puzzle for the reader. 

## Ronald Knox's Ten Commandments of Detective Fiction

1. **The criminal must be someone mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has been allowed to know.**

2. **All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course.**

3. **Not more than one secret room or passage is allowable.**

4. **No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end.**

5. **No Chinaman must figure in the story.**

6. **No accident must ever help the detective, nor must he ever have an unaccountable intuition which proves to be right.**

7. **The detective must not himself commit the crime.**

8. **The detective must not light on any clues which are not instantly produced for the inspection of the reader.**

9. **The stupid friend of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal any thoughts which pass through his mind; his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader.**

10. **Twin brothers, and doubles generally, must not appear unless we have been duly prepared for them.**

## Context and Purpose

- **Fair Play**: The primary goal of Knox's commandments was 
  to ensure that the detective fiction genre maintained 
  a fair play between the author and the reader. 
  The reader should have an equal chance to solve the mystery 
  based on the clues provided.
- **Era**: These commandments reflect the ethos of 
  the Golden Age of Detective Fiction (roughly the 1920s and 1930s), 
  a period when the genre emphasized logical deduction 
  and the intellectual challenge of solving a crime.

## Influence

Knox's rules were influential in shaping the detective fiction genre, 
promoting a standard that many authors adhered to during the Golden Age.
