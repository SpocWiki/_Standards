# [[Crime_Fiction]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **crime fiction**, detective story, murder mystery, crime novel, mystery novel, and police novel 
> are terms used to describe narratives or fiction that centre on criminal acts 
> and especially on the investigation, either by an amateur or a professional detective, 
> of a crime, often a murder. Most crime drama focuses on criminal investigation and does not feature the courtroom. Suspense and mystery are key elements that are nearly ubiquitous to the genre.
>
> It is usually distinguished from mainstream fiction and other genres such as historical fiction and science fiction, but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has several subgenres, including detective fiction (such as the whodunit), courtroom drama, hard-boiled fiction, and legal thrillers.
