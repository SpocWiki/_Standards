## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future. 
> Time travel is a concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly science fiction. 
> 
> In fiction, time travel is typically achieved through the use of a device known as a time machine. 
> The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells's 1895 novel The Time Machine.
>
> It is uncertain whether time travel to the past would be physically possible. 
> 
> Such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. 
> Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, 
> is an extensively observed phenomenon 
> and is well understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. 
> 
> However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds 
> compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. 
> 
> As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, 
> such as a rotating black hole. 
> 
> Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, 
> and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes.
