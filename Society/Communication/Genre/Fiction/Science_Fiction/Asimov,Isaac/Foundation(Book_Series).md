> The Foundation series is a science fiction book series written by American author Isaac Asimov. 
> First published as a series of short stories and novellas in 1942–50, and subsequently in three books in 1951–53, 
> for nearly thirty years the series was widely known as The Foundation Trilogy: 
> Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953). 
> It won the one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966. 
> Asimov later added new volumes, with two sequels, Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), 
> and two prequels, Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993).
>
> The premise of the stories is that in the waning days of a future Galactic Empire, 
> the mathematician Hari Seldon devises the theory of psychohistory, a new and effective mathematics of sociology. 
> Using statistical laws of mass action, it can predict the future of large populations. 
> 
> Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, 
> and a dark age lasting 30,000 years before a second empire arises. 
> Although the momentum of the Empire's fall is too great to stop, 
> Seldon devises a plan by which "the onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little" 
> to eventually limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. 
> 
> The books describe some of the dramatic events of those years 
> as they are shaped by the underlying political and social mechanics of Seldon's Plan.
