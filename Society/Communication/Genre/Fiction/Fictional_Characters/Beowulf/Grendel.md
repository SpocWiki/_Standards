> **Grendel** is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf (700–1000 AD). 
> He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with his mother and the dragon), 
> all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf. 
> 
> He is referred to as both an eoten and a þyrs, types of beings from wider Germanic mythology. 
> He is also described as a descendant of the Biblical Cain 
> and "a creature of darkness, exiled from happiness and accursed of God, 
> the destroyer and devourer of our human kind." 
> 
> He is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, 
> although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being 
> is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. 
> 
> The character of Grendel and his role in the story of Beowulf 
> have been subject to numerous reinterpretations and re-imaginings. 
> Grendel is feared by all in Heorot but Beowulf, who kills both him and his mother.
