## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Beowulf** (Old English: Bēowulf [ˈbeːowuɫf]) is an Old English poem, 
> an epic in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines, 
> contained in the Nowell Codex. 
> 
> It is one of the most important and most often translated works of Old English literature. 
> The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; 
> the only certain dating is for the manuscript, 
> which was produced between 975 and 1025 AD. 
> Scholars call the anonymous author the "Beowulf poet". 
>
> The story is set in pagan Scandinavia in the 5th and 6th centuries. 
> Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, 
> whose mead hall Heorot has been under attack by the monster Grendel for twelve years. 
> 
> After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother takes revenge and is in turn defeated. 
> Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland and becomes king of the Geats. 
> Fifty years later, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is mortally wounded in the battle. 
> After his death, his attendants cremate his body 
> and erect a barrow on a headland in his memory.
>
> Scholars have debated whether Beowulf was transmitted orally, affecting its interpretation: 
> - if it was composed early, in pagan times, 
>   then the paganism is central and the Christian elements were added later, whereas 
> - if it was composed later, in writing, by a Christian, then the pagan elements could be decorative archaising; 
> - some scholars also hold an intermediate position. 
>
> Beowulf is written mostly in the Late West Saxon dialect of Old English, 
> but many other dialectal forms are present, 
> suggesting that the poem may have had a long and complex transmission 
> throughout the dialect areas of England.
>
> There has long been research into similarities with other traditions and accounts, 
> including the Icelandic Grettis saga, the Norse story of Hrolf Kraki 
> and his bear-shapeshifting servant Bodvar Bjarki, 
> the international folktale the Bear's Son Tale, 
> and the Irish folktale of the Hand and the Child. 
> 
> Persistent attempts have been made 
> to link Beowulf to tales from Homer's Odyssey or Virgil's Aeneid. 
> More definite are biblical parallels, 
> with clear allusions to the books of Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel.
>
> The poem survives in a single copy in the manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. 
> It has no title in the original manuscript, 
> but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist. 
> In 1731, the manuscript was damaged 
> by a fire that swept through Ashburnham House in London, 
> which was housing  Sir Robert Cotton's collection of medieval manuscripts. 
> It survived, but the margins were charred, and some readings were lost. 
> The Nowell Codex is housed in the British Library. 
>
> The poem was first transcribed in 1786; 
> some verses were first translated into modern English in 1805, 
> and nine complete translations were made in the 19th century, 
> including those by John Mitchell Kemble and William Morris.
>
> After 1900, hundreds of translations were made, 
> whether into prose, rhyming verse, or alliterative verse, 
> some relatively faithful, some archaising, some attempting to domesticate the work. 
> 
> Among the best-known modern translations are those of Edwin Morgan, Burton Raffel, Michael J. Alexander, Roy Liuzza, and Seamus Heaney. 
> 
> The difficulty of translating Beowulf has been explored by scholars including J. R. R. Tolkien 
> (in his essay "On Translating Beowulf"), 
> who worked on a verse and a prose translation of his own.
