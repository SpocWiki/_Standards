> - "System 2" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. 
>
> The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations 
> or triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other, 
> starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion. 
> 
> From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, 
> the book summarizes several decades of research 
> to suggest that people have too much confidence in human judgment. 
> 
> Kahneman performed his own research, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, 
> which enriched his experience to write the book. 
> It covers different phases of his career: 
> - his early work concerning cognitive biases, 
> - his work on prospect theory and happiness, and 
> - with the Israel Defense Forces.
