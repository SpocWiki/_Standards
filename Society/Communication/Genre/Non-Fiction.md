## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Non-fiction (or nonfiction) is any document or media content 
> that attempts, in good faith, to convey information only about the real world, 
> rather than being grounded in imagination. 
> 
> Non-fiction typically aims to present topics objectively 
> based on historical, scientific, and empirical information. 
> 
> However, some non-fiction ranges into more subjective territory, 
> including sincerely held opinions on real-world topics.
>
> Often referring specifically to prose writing, non-fiction 
> is one of the two fundamental approaches to story and storytelling, 
> in contrast to narrative fiction, which is largely populated by imaginary characters and events. 
> 
> Non-fiction writers can show the reasons and consequences of events, 
> they can compare, contrast, classify, categorise and summarise information, 
> put the facts in a logical or chronological order, infer and reach conclusions about facts, etc. 
> 
> They can use graphic, structural and printed appearance features 
> such as pictures, graphs or charts, diagrams, flowcharts, summaries, glossaries, sidebars, 
> timelines, table of contents, headings, subheadings, bolded or italicised words, 
> footnotes, maps, indices, labels, captions, etc. to help readers find information.        
>
> While specific claims in a non-fiction work may prove inaccurate, 
> the sincere author aims to be truthful at the time of composition. 
> 
> A non-fiction account is an exercise in accurately representing a topic, 
> and remains distinct from any implied endorsement.
