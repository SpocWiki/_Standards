## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Telecommunication**, often used in its plural form or abbreviated as telecom, 
> is the transmission of information over a distance using electrical or electronic means, 
> typically through cables, radio waves, or other communication technologies. 
> 
> These means of transmission may be divided into communication channels 
> for multiplexing, allowing for a single medium 
> to transmit several concurrent communication sessions. 
> 
> Long-distance technologies invented during the 20th and 21st centuries 
> generally use electric power, and include the electrical [[Telegraph]], [[Telecommunication/Telephone|Telephone]], television, and radio.
>
> Early telecommunication networks used metal wires as the medium for transmitting signals. These networks were used for telegraphy and telephony for many decades. In the first decade of the 20th century, a revolution in wireless communication began with breakthroughs including those made in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi, who won the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other early pioneers in electrical and electronic telecommunications include co-inventors of the telegraph Charles Wheatstone and Samuel Morse, numerous inventors and developers of the telephone including Antonio Meucci, Philipp Reis, Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell, inventors of radio Edwin Armstrong and Lee de Forest, as well as inventors of television like Vladimir K. Zworykin, John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth.
>
> Since the 1960s, the proliferation of digital technologies has meant that voice communications have gradually been supplemented by data. The physical limitations of metallic media prompted the development of optical fibre. The Internet, a technology independent of any given medium, has provided global access to services for individual users and further reduced location and time limitations on communications.
