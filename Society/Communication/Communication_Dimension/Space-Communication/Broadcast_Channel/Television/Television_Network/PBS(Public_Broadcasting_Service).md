> and non-commercial, free-to-air television network based in Arlington, Virginia. 
>

> and the most prominent provider of educational programs 
> to public television stations in the United States, 
> distributing shows such as Nature, Nova, Frontline, PBS News Hour, Washington Week, Masterpiece, American Experience, 
> and children's programs such as Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Sesame Street, Barney & Friends, Arthur, Curious George, The Magic School Bus, and others. 
> 
> Certain stations also provide spillover service to Canada.
>
> PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues, pledge drives, corporate sponsorships, and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens. 
> 
> From its founding in 1969 up until 2025, 
> it also received funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
> 
> All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards 
> to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source. 
> 
> PBS has over 350 member television stations, 
> many owned by educational institutions, nonprofit groups 
> both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or 
> collegiate educational institution, or entities owned by or related to state government.
