## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Cable News Network (**CNN**) is an American multinational  news media company 
> and the flagship property of CNN Worldwide, a division of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). 
> 
> Founded on June 1, 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld 
> as a 24-hour cable news channel and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, 
> CNN is the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage 
> and the first all-news television channel in the United States.
>
> As of December 2023, CNN had 68,974,000 television households as subscribers in the United States. According to Nielsen, down from 80 million in March 2021. In June 2021, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 580,000 viewers throughout the day, down 49% from a year earlier, amid sharp declines in viewers across all cable news networks. While CNN ranked 14th among all basic cable networks in 2019, then jumped to 7th during a major surge for the three largest cable news networks (completing a rankings streak of Fox News at number 5 and MSNBC at number 6 for that year), it settled back to number 11 in 2021 and had further declined to number 21 in 2022.
>
> Globally, CNN programming has aired through CNN International, seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories. Since May 2019, however, the American domestic version has absorbed international news coverage in order to reduce programming costs. The American version, sometimes referred to as CNN (US), is also available in Canada, and some islands in the Caribbean. CNN also licenses its brand and content to other channels, such as CNN-News18 in India. In Japan it broadcasts CNNj which started in 2003, with simultaneous translation in Japanese.
