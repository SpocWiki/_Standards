## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show that has been broadcast on NBC since 1954. 
> The program has been hosted by six comedians: 
> - Steve Allen (1954–1957), 
> - Jack Paar (1957–1962), 
> - Johnny Carson (1962–1992), 
> - Jay Leno (1992–2009 and 2010–2014), 
> - Conan O'Brien (2009–2010), and 
> - Jimmy Fallon (2014–present).
>
> Besides the main hosts, a number of regular "guest hosts" have been used, 
> notably Ernie Kovacs, who hosted two nights per week during 1956–1957, 
> and a number of guests used by Carson, who curtailed his own hosting duties back to three nights per week by the 1980s. 
> Among Carson's regular guest hosts were Joey Bishop,  McLean Stevenson, David Letterman, David Brenner and Joan Rivers, 
> with his final regular guest host being his eventual successor Jay Leno. 
> The practice of hiring guest hosts has been mostly discontinued by Leno and his successors, 
> who prefer airing reruns to showcasing potential rivals.
>
> The Tonight Show is the world's longest-running talk show 
> and the longest-running regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. 
> 
> It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows Today and Meet the Press. 
> The current incarnation is taped from Studio 6B at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center in New York, 
> the same studio used during the later Jack Paar era and the first 10 years of Carson. 
> 
> During its initial run under Steve Allen, it originated from the Hudson Theatre on Broadway. 
> From 1973 to 2009, and from 2010 to 2014 the show was taped at one of three different studios at NBC's Burbank, California Studios. 
> During Conan O'Brien's brief tenure, the show was taped at an opulently reworked studio on Stage 1 of Universal Studios Hollywood. 
>
> Over the course of almost 70 years, The Tonight Show has undergone only minor title changes. 
> It aired under the name Tonight for several of its early years, as well as Tonight Starring Jack Paar and The Jack Paar Show due to the runaway popularity of its host, eventually settling permanently on The Tonight Show after Carson began his tenure in 1962, albeit with the host's name always included in the title. Beginning with Carson's debut episode, network programmers, advertisers, and the show's announcers would refer to the show by including the name of the host: 
> - The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, 
> - The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 
> - The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien, and, currently, 
> - The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. 
> In the 1950s and 1960s TV listings publications such as TV Guide often listed the show as simply Jack Parr or Johnny Carson.  
>
> In 1957, the show briefly tried a more news-style format (during which time its title was adjusted to Tonight! America After Dark). 
> It has otherwise adhered to the talk show format introduced by Allen and honed further by Paar.
>
> Carson is the longest-serving host to date, although he is not the host with the most episodes. The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson aired for 30 seasons between October 1962 and May 1992. Leno has the record of having hosted the greatest number of total televised episodes. Leno's record is due to the fact that, unlike Carson (who only produced new shows three days a week, these being typically Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, starting in the 1980s), Leno also never used guest hosts on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (except Katie Couric, once) and produced new shows five days a week; Leno himself was also Carson's primary guest host for the last five years of Carson's tenure, adding even more episodes to his credit. Leaving out Leno's five years as permanent guest host, Leno hosted 119 more episodes as full-time host than Carson.
>
> During Carson's first four years, the show ran for 105 minutes and then was reduced to ninety minutes in early 1967 when Carson stopped appearing for the first 15 minutes because most affiliates were carrying their local news during that time slot as they expanded to half an hour. During Carson's 1980 contract negotiations, the show was shortened to sixty minutes beginning that September, where it has remained since. NBC also broadcast The Best of Carson which were repeats of some of Carson's popular older albeit usually recent shows. Prior to the debut of Saturday Night Live in October 1975, NBC aired The Best of Carson on Saturday nights at 11:30 pm. During Leno's tenure as permanent guest host, The Best of Carson usually aired on Mondays with Leno hosting on Tuesdays.
>
> Also featuring prominently on Carson's show was his sidekick Ed McMahon, who introduced Carson and typically appeared alongside him for the entire episode. By the end of Carson's tenure, McMahon usually only appeared in episodes hosted by Carson, and the use of a sidekick in such a manner has not been continued under Leno and his successors. 
>
> Apart from the show's brief run as a news show in 1957, its shortest-serving host was Conan O'Brien, 
> who went on to continue hosting a late-night program following his controversial departure. 
> O'Brien hosted 146 episodes over the course of fewer than eight months before Leno was brought back as host, 
> where he served for almost four additional years. 
> 
> Current host Fallon debuted on February 17, 2014. 
> Fallon had previously hosted Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, 
> and before Late Night he was a popular member of the cast of Saturday Night Live, 
> co-hosting the "Weekend Update" segment with Tina Fey as well as performing sketches.
