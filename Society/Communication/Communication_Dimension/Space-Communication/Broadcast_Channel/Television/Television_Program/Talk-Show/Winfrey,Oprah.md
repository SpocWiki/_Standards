## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Oprah Gail Winfrey (born Orpah Gail Winfrey; January 29, 1954) 
> is an American talk show host, television producer, actress, author, and media proprietor. 
> 
> She is best known for her talk show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast from Chicago, 
> which ran in national syndication for 25 years, from 1986 to 2011. 
> Globally, she is the richest Black woman and the wealthiest female celebrity. 
> Dubbed the "Queen of All Media", she was the richest African-American of the 20th century 
> and was once the world's only Black billionaire. 
> By 2007, she was often ranked as the most influential woman in the world.
>
> Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a single teenage mother 
> and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee. 
> She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teenage years 
> and became pregnant at 14; her son was born prematurely and died in infancy. 
> Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, 
> a barber in Nashville, Tennessee, and landed a job in radio while still in high school. 
> 
> By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local evening news. 
> Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery 
> eventually led to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena, 
> and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, 
> she launched her own production company.
>
> Credited with creating a more intimate, confessional form of media communication, 
> Winfrey popularized and revolutionized the tabloid talk show genre pioneered by Phil Donahue. 
> 
> By the mid-1990s, Winfrey had reinvented her show 
> with a focus on literature, self-improvement, mindfulness, and spirituality. 
> She has been criticized for unleashing a confession culture, 
> promoting controversial self-help ideas, and having an emotion-centered approach, 
> and has also been praised for overcoming adversity to become a benefactor to others. 
> 
> Winfrey also emerged as a political force in the 2008 presidential race, 
> with her endorsement of Barack Obama estimated to have been worth about one million votes 
> during the 2008 Democratic primaries.  
> In the same year, she formed her own network, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN). 
> In 2013, Winfrey was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
>
> In 1994, Winfrey was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. 
> Then in October, she finished the Marine Corps Marathon in less than four and a half hours. 
> She has received honorary doctorate degrees from multiple universities. 
> Winfrey has won many awards throughout her career, including 19 Daytime Emmy Awards 
> (including the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chairman's Award), 
> 2 Primetime Emmy Awards (including the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award), 
> a Tony Award, a Peabody Award, and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award 
> awarded by the Academy Awards, in addition to two competitive Academy Award nominations. 
> 
> Winfrey was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021.
