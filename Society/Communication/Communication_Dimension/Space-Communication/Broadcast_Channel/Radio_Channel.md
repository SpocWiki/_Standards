> Radio broadcasting is the transmission of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) 
> to receivers over a wide territory. 
> 
> Most broadcasts are audio (sound), sometimes with embedded metadata. 
> Listeners need a broadcast radio receiver to pick up these signals. 
> 
> "Terrestrial" broadcasts, including AM, FM and DAB stations, 
> originate signals from a land-based transmitter, 
> while "satellite radio" signals originate from a satellite in Earth orbit.
>
> Individual own programming, or are affiliated with a radio network that provides content, 
> either in broadcast syndication or by simulcasting, or both. 
> 
> The most common transmission technologies are analog and digital signals.  
> Analog radio uses one of two modulation methods: 
> - amplitude modulation, used by AM radio, 
> - or frequency modulation, for FM radio.  
> A newer technique, digital radio stations, transmit 
> using one of several different digital audio standards, such as 
> - DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), 
> - HD radio, or 
> - DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale).
