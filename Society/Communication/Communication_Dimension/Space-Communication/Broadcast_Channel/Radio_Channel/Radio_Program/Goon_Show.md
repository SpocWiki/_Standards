> The Goon Show is a British radio comedy programme, 
> originally produced and broadcast by the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1960, 
> with occasional repeats on the BBC Light Programme. 
> 
> The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, 
> was titled Crazy People; subsequent series had the title The Goon Show.
>
> The show's creator and primary writer was Spike Milligan, 
> who performed in the series alongside Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers 
> and (for the first two series) Michael Bentine. 
> 
> The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases 
> and an array of bizarre sound effects. There were also light music interludes. 
> 
> Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects 
> devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, 
> many of which were reused by other shows for decades. 
> 
> Elements of the show satirised contemporary life in 1950s Britain, 
> parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, geography, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.
>
> The show was released internationally through the BBC Transcription Services (TS). 
> It aired regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, 
> although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects. 
> 
> In the United States, NBC began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s.
>
> Subversive and absurdist, The Goon Show exercised a considerable influence 
> on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture. 
> 
> It was cited as a major influence by the Beatles, 
> the American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre, and the British comedy troupe Monty Python.
