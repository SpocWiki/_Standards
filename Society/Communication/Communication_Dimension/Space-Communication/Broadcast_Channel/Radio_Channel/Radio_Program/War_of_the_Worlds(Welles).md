## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> "The War of the Worlds" was a Halloween episode of the radio series 
> The Mercury Theatre on the Air which was broadcast live at 8 pm ET on October 30, 1938 
> over the CBS Radio Network. 
> 
> The episode was directed and narrated by Orson Welles 
> as an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds 
> and is infamous for inciting a panic by convincing some members of the listening audience 
> that a Martian invasion was actually taking place.
>
> The first half of the program was delivered in a realistic "breaking news" format. 
> Since the Mercury Theatre on the Air had few commercial interruptions, 
> the first break came after fictional reporters had described a devastating alien invasion 
> and the fall of New York City. 
> 
> This apparently caused some confusion and fear among its listeners, 
> though the scale of the panic is disputed. 
> Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience 
> may have been listening to the much more highly rated show The Chase and Sanborn Hour 
> with Edgar Bergen on NBC and switched to "The War of the Worlds" during a musical interlude, 
> thereby missing Welles's introduction of his show as a work of science fiction. 
> However, modern research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.
>
> Officials with CBS became aware of the public's growing reaction 
> while the show was still being performed live, 
> and though there was some pressure to stop the production, 
> it continued to its planned conclusion. 
> 
> There was widespread media outrage in the hours and days that followed. 
> The program's news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers 
> and public figures, leading to an outcry against the broadcasters 
> and calls for regulation by the FCC.
>
> Welles apologized at a hastily called news conference the next morning, 
> and no punitive action was taken. 
> 
> The broadcast and subsequent publicity 
> brought the 23-year-old Welles to the attention of the general public 
> and gave him the reputation of an innovative storyteller and "trickster".
