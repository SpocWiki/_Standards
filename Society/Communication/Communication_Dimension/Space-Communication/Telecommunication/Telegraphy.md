> **Telegraphy** is the long-distance transmission of messages 
> where the sender uses symbolic codes, known to the recipient, 
> rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message. 
> 
> Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy, whereas pigeon post is not. 
> 
> Ancient signalling systems, although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated 
> as in China, were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages. 
> 
> Possible messages were fixed and predetermined, 
> so such systems are thus not true telegraphs.
>
> The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the Chappe telegraph, 
> an optical telegraph invented by Claude Chappe in the late 18th century. 
> The system was used extensively in France, 
> and European nations occupied by France, during the Napoleonic era. 
> 
> The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century. 
> It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, 
> initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling. 
> 
> This was quickly followed by a system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse. 
> 
> The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France 
> due to the established optical telegraph system, 
> but an electrical telegraph was put into use 
> with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph. 
> 
> The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865, 
> using a modified Morse code developed in Germany in 1848.
>
> The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling. 
> It was mainly used in areas where the electrical telegraph had not been established 
> and generally used the same code. 
> 
> The most extensive heliograph network established 
> was in Arizona and New Mexico during the Apache Wars. 
> 
> The heliograph was standard military equipment as late as World War II. 
> Wireless telegraphy developed in the early 20th century 
> became important for maritime use, and was a competitor to electrical telegraphy 
> using submarine telegraph cables in international communications.
>
> Telegrams became a popular means of sending messages 
> once telegraph prices had fallen sufficiently. 
> 
> Traffic became high enough to spur the development of automated systems—
> teleprinters and punched tape transmission. 
> 
> These systems led to new telegraph codes, starting with the Baudot code. 
> 
> However, telegrams were never able to compete with the letter post on price, 
> and competition from the telephone, which removed their speed advantage, 
> drove the telegraph into decline from 1920 onwards. 
> 
> The few remaining telegraph applications were largely 
> taken over by alternatives on the internet towards the end of the 20th century.
