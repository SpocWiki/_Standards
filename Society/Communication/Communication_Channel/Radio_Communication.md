> Radio is the technology of communicating using radio waves. 
> Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 3 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). 
> They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves. 
> 
> They can be received by other antennas connected to a radio receiver; 
> this is the fundamental principle of radio communication. 
> In addition to communication, radio is used for radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications.
>
> In radio communication, used in radio and television broadcasting, cell phones, two-way radios, wireless networking, and satellite communication, among numerous other uses, 
> radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by modulating the radio signal 
> (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. 
> 
> In radar, used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, 
> a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, 
> and the reflected waves reveal the object's location to a receiver that is typically colocated with the transmitter. 
> 
> In radio navigation systems such as GPS and VOR, 
> a mobile navigation instrument receives radio signals from multiple navigational radio beacons whose position is known, 
> and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. 
> 
> In wireless radio remote control devices like drones, garage door openers, and keyless entry systems, 
> radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.
>
> The existence of radio waves was first proven by German physicist Heinrich Hertz on 11 November 1886. 
> In the mid-1890s, building on techniques physicists were using to study electromagnetic waves, 
> Italian physicist Guglielmo Marconi developed the first apparatus for long-distance radio communication, 
> sending a wireless Morse Code message to a recipient over a kilometer away in 1895, 
> and the first transatlantic signal on 12 December 1901.  
> 
> The first commercial radio broadcast was transmitted on 2 November 1920, 
> when the live returns of the 1920 United States presidential election were broadcast 
> by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, under the call sign KDKA.
>
> The emission of radio waves is regulated by law, 
> coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 
> which allocates frequency bands in the radio spectrum for various uses.
