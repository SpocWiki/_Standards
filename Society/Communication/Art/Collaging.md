## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Collage (, from the French: coller, "to glue" or "to stick together") is a technique of art creation, 
> primarily used in the visual arts, but in music too, 
> by which art results from an assembly of different forms, thus creating a new whole. 
> (Compare with pastiche, which is a "pasting" together.) 
> 
> Collage may refer to the technique as a whole, or more specifically to a two-dimensional work, 
> assembled from flat pieces on a flat substrate, 
> whereas assemblage typically refers to a three-dimensional equivalent.
>
> A collage may sometimes include magazine and newspaper clippings, 
> ribbons, paint, bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, 
> photographs and other found objects, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. 
> 
> The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, 
> but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an art form of novelty.
>
> The term Papier collé was coined by both Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso 
> in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of modern art.
