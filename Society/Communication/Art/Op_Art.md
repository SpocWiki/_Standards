> Op art, short for optical art, is a style of visual art 
> that uses distorted or manipulated geometrical patterns, often to create optical illusions.  
> 
> It began in the early 20th century, and was especially popular from the 1960s on, 
> the term "Op art" dating to 1964. 
>
> Op artworks are normally abstract, with some better-known pieces created in black and white. 
> Typically, they give the viewer the impression of movement, hidden images, 
> flashing and vibrating patterns, or swelling or warping.  
> 
> In contrast, the much older trompe-l'Å“il style always represents figurative subjects, 
> which are shown with deceptive three-dimensionality.
