## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Land art, variously known as Earth art, environmental art, and Earthworks, 
> is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, 
> largely associated with Great Britain and the United States 
> but that also includes examples from many other countries. 
> 
> As a trend, "land art" expanded the boundaries of traditional art making in the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used are often the materials of the Earth, including the soil, rocks, vegetation, and water found on-site, and the sites are often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation is commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.
>
> Concerns of the art movement center around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The beginning of the movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, and an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet Earth as home to humanity.
