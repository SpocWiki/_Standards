> The **Baroque** (UK:  bə-ROK, US:  bə-ROHK, French: [baʁɔk]) is a Western style of 
> architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and other arts 
> that flourished from the early 17th century until the 1750s. 
> 
> It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism 
> and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as "late Baroque") and Neoclassical styles. 
> It was encouraged by the Catholic Church 
> as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, 
> though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.
>
> The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep color, grandeur, and surprise 
> to achieve a sense of awe. 
> 
> The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, 
> then spread rapidly to the rest of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, 
> then to Austria, southern Germany, Poland and Russia. 
> 
> By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, 
> which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century. 
> In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires including the Iberian Peninsula 
> it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century.
>
> In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. 
> The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country. 
> But a general feature is that everywhere 
> the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. 
> 
> The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. 
> New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, 
> baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved.
