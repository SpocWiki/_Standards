> **Post-impressionism** (also spelled Postimpressionism) was a predominantly French art movement 
> which developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, 
> from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism. 
> 
> Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction 
> against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. 
> Its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content means Post-Impressionism 
> encompasses Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, the Pont-Aven School, and Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement's principal artists were Paul Cézanne (known as the father of Post-Impressionism), Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.
>
> The term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d'Automne published in Art News, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a "post-impressionist leader"; there was also an advert for the show The Post-Impressionists of France. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Édouard Manet.
>
> Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, sometimes using impasto (thick application of paint) and painting from life, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or modified colour.
