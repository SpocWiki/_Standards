> **Rococo**, less commonly Roccoco ( rə-KOH-koh, US also  ROH-kə-KOH; French: [ʁɔkɔko] or [ʁokoko] ), 
> also known as Late Baroque, is an exceptionally ornamental and dramatic style of 
> architecture, art, and decoration 
> which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colours, sculpted moulding, 
> and trompe-l'œil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama. 
> It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.
>
> Originally known as the “style Rocaille," Rococo began in France in the 1730s 
> as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Louis XIV style. 
> 
> It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly 
> northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. 
> 
> It also came to influence other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware, glassware, painting, music, theatre, and literature.  
> 
> Although originally a secular style primarily used for interiors of private residences, the Rococo had a spiritual aspect to it which led to its widespread use in church interiors, particularly in Central Europe, Portugal, and South America.
