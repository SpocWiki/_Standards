> The art of Ancient Rome, and the territories of its Republic and later Empire, 
> includes architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. 
> 
> Luxury objects in metal-work, gem engraving, ivory carvings, and glass 
> are sometimes considered to be minor forms of **Roman Art**, 
> although they were not considered as such at the time. 
> 
> Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, 
> but figure painting was also highly regarded. 
> 
> A very large body of sculpture has survived from about the 1st century BC onward, 
> though very little from before, but very little painting remains, 
> and probably nothing that a contemporary would have considered to be of the highest quality.
>
> Ancient Roman pottery was not a luxury product, but a vast production of "fine wares" in terra sigillata were decorated with reliefs that reflected the latest taste, and provided a large group in society with stylish objects at what was evidently an affordable price. Roman coins were an important means of propaganda, and have survived in enormous numbers.
