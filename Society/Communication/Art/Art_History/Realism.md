> In art, **Realism** is generally the attempt to represent subject-matter truthfully, 
> without artificiality, exaggeration, or speculative or supernatural elements. 
> 
> The term is often used interchangeably with naturalism, 
> although these terms are not necessarily synonymous. 
> 
> Naturalism, as an idea relating to visual representation in Western art, 
> seeks to depict objects with the least possible amount of distortion 
> and is tied to the development of linear perspective and illusionism in Renaissance Europe. 
> 
> Realism, while predicated upon naturalistic representation 
> and a departure from the idealization of earlier academic art, 
> often refers to a specific art historical movement that originated in France 
> in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848. 
> 
> With artists like Gustave Courbet capitalizing on the mundane, ugly or sordid, 
> realism was motivated by the renewed interest in the commoner and the rise of leftist politics. 
> The realist painters rejected Romanticism, 
> which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.
>
> In 19th-century Europe, "Naturalism" or the "Naturalist school" was somewhat artificially erected 
> as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of realism, 
> that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent 
> by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, 
> playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of natural history, 
> as the biological sciences were then generally known.
>
> There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, 
> such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism and Italian neorealist cinema.
