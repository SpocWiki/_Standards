> Literary Impressionism is influenced by the European Impressionist art movement; 
> as such, many writers adopted a style that relied on associations. 
> 
> The Dutch Tachtigers explicitly 
> tried to incorporate Impressionism into their prose, poems, and other literary works. 
> Much of what has been called "impressionist" literature is subsumed into several other categories, 
> especially Symbolism, its chief exponents being Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, Verlaine 
> and Laforgue, and the Imagists. 
> It focuses on a particular character's perception of events. 
> The edges of reality are blurred by choosing points of view that lie outside the norm.
>
> Impressionistic literature can be simply defined as 
> when an author centers their story or attention on the character's mental life 
> (such as the character's impressions, feelings, sensations and emotions) 
> rather than trying to interpret them. 
> 
> Authors such as Virginia Woolf (Mrs Dalloway) 
> and Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness and "The Lagoon") are among the foremost creators of the form. 
> These novels have been said to be the finest examples of a genre which is not easily comprehensible.
>
> The term is used to describe a work of literature characterized by the selection of a few details 
> to convey the sense impressions left by an incident or scene. 
> This style of writing occurs when characters, scenes, or actions 
> are portrayed from a subjective point of view of reality.
>
> In Russian literature, 
> the modernist novelist Aleksey Remizov is considered the most impressionist author.
