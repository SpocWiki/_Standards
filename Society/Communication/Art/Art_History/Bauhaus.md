> The Staatliches **Bauhaus** (German: [ˈʃtaːtlɪçəs ˈbaʊˌhaʊs] ), 
> commonly known as the Bauhaus (German for 'building house'), 
> was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. 
> 
> The school became famous for its approach to design, 
> which attempted to unify individual artistic vision 
> with the principles of mass production and emphasis on function.
>
> The Bauhaus was founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar. 
> It was grounded in the idea of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork") 
> in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. 
> 
> The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, 
> modernist architecture, and architectural education. 
> The Bauhaus movement had a profound influence on subsequent developments in 
> art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography. 
> Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as 
> - Paul Klee, 
> - Wassily Kandinsky, 
> - Gunta Stölzl, and 
> - László Moholy-Nagy at various points.
>
> The school existed in three German cities 
> Weimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933—under three different architect-directors: 
> Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933
> 
> 1933  the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, 
> having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. 
> Internationally, former key figures of Bauhaus were successful in the United States 
> and became known as the avant-garde for the International Style. 
> The White city of Tel Aviv, to which numerous Jewish Bauhaus architects emigrated, 
> has the highest concentration of the Bauhaus' international architecture in the world.
>
> The changes of venue and leadership 
> resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. 
> For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, 
> even though it had been an important revenue source; 
> when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school 
> and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.
