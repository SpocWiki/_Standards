## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Postmodern art is a body of art movements that sought to contradict some aspects of modernism 
> or some aspects that emerged or developed in its aftermath. 
> 
> In general, movements such as intermedia, installation art, conceptual art and multimedia, 
> particularly involving video are described as postmodern.
>
> There are several characteristics which lend art to being postmodern; 
> these include the recycling of past styles and themes in a modern-day context, bricolage, 
> the use of text prominently as the central artistic element, collage, simplification, appropriation, performance art, as well as the break-up of the barrier between fine and high arts and low art and popular culture.
