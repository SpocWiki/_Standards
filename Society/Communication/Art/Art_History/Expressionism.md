> **Expressionism** is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, 
> originating in Northern Europe around the beginning of the 20th century. 
> 
> Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, 
> distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. 
> Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.
>
> Expressionism developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. 
> It remained popular during the Weimar Republic, particularly in Berlin. 
> 
> The style extended to a wide range of the arts, 
> including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music. 
> 
> Paris became a gathering place for a group of Expressionist artists, many of Jewish origin, 
> dubbed the School of Paris. 
> After World War II, figurative expressionism influenced artists and styles around the world.
>
> The term is sometimes suggestive of angst. 
> 
> In a historical sense, much older painters such as 
> Matthias GrÃ¼newald and El Greco are sometimes termed expressionist, 
> though the term is applied mainly to 20th-century works. 
> 
> The Expressionist emphasis on individual and subjective perspective has been characterized as 
> a reaction to positivism and other artistic styles such as Naturalism and Impressionism.
