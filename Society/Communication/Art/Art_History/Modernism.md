> **Modernism** was an early 20th-century movement in literature, visual arts, performing arts, and music 
> that emphasized experimentation, abstraction, and subjective experience. 
> Philosophy, politics, architecture, and social issues were all aspects of this movement. 
> Modernism centered around beliefs in a "growing alienation" 
> from prevailing "morality, optimism, and convention" 
> and a desire to change how "human beings in a society interact and live together".
>
> The modernist movement emerged during the late 19th century 
> in response to significant changes in Western culture, including secularization 
> and the growing influence of science. 
> 
> It is characterized by a self-conscious rejection of tradition 
> and the search for newer means of cultural expression. 
> 
> Modernism was influenced by widespread technological innovation, industrialization, 
> and urbanization, as well as the cultural and geopolitical shifts that occurred after World War I. 
> 
> Artistic movements and techniques associated with modernism include 
> - abstract art, 
> - literary stream-of-consciousness, 
> - cinematic montage, 
> - musical atonality and twelve-tonality, 
> - modern dance, 
> - modernist architecture, and 
> - urban planning.
>
> Modernism took a critical stance towards the Enlightenment concept of rationalism. 
> The movement also rejected the concept of absolute originality — 
> the idea of "Creatio ex nihilo" creation out of nothing — 
> upheld in the 19th century by both realism and Romanticism, replacing it with techniques of 
> collage, reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, and parody. 
> 
> Another feature of modernism was reflexivity about artistic and social convention, 
> which led to experimentation highlighting how works of art are made 
> as well as the material from which they are created. 
> 
> Debate about the timeline of modernism continues, 
> with some scholars arguing that it evolved into late modernism or high modernism. 
> 
> Postmodernism, meanwhile, rejects many of the principles of modernism.
