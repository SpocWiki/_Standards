> **Iconoclasm** (from Ancient Greek  εἰκών (eikṓn) 'figure, icon' and  κλάω (kláō) 'to break') 
> is the belief in the importance of the destruction of icons and other images or monuments, 
> often for religious or political reasons. 
> 
> Those who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts, 
> a term that has come to be applied figuratively and more broadly to 
> anyone who challenges "cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious."
>
> Conversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an iconolater; 
> in a Byzantine context, such a person is called an iconodule or iconophile. 
> 
> Iconoclasm does **not** generally encompass the destruction of the images of a specific ruler 
> after their death or overthrow, a practice better known as damnatio memoriae.
>
> While iconoclasm may be carried out by adherents of a different religion, 
> it is **more commonly the result of sectarian** disputes between factions of the same religion. 
> 
> The term originates from the Byzantine Iconoclasm, 
> the struggles between proponents and opponents of religious icons in the Byzantine Empire 
> from 726 to 842 AD. 
> 
> While the enthusiasm for iconoclasm varies among faiths, 
> the practice is more common in religions which oppose idolatry, such as the Abrahamic religions. 
> 
> Outside of the religious context, 
> iconoclasm can refer to movements for widespread destruction in symbols of an ideology or cause, 
> such as the destruction of monarchist symbols during the French Revolution.
