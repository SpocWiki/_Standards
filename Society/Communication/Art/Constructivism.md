> **Constructivism** is an early twentieth-century art movement 
> founded in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko. 
> 
> Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. 
> The movement rejected decorative stylization in favour of the industrial assemblage of materials. 
> Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, 
> and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde.
>
> Constructivist architecture and art had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, 
> influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. 
> 
> Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, sculpture, 
> graphic design, industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and, to some extent, music.
