> Etruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization in central Italy 
> between the 10th and 1st centuries BC. 
> 
> From around 750 BC it was heavily influenced by Greek art, which was imported by the Etruscans, 
> but always retained distinct characteristics. 
> 
> Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta 
> (especially life-size on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking especially in bronze. 
> Jewellery and engraved gems of high quality were produced.
>
> Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, 
> but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  
> In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, 
> despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including Carrara marble, 
> which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.
>
> The great majority of survivals came from tombs, 
> which were typically crammed with sarcophagi and grave goods, 
> and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples. 
> Tombs have produced all the fresco wall-paintings, 
> which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.
>
> Bucchero wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. 
> 
> There was also a tradition of elaborate Etruscan vase painting, which sprang from its Greek equivalent; 
> the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek vases. 
> 
> Etruscan temples were heavily decorated 
> with colourfully painted terracotta antefixes and other fittings, 
> which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. 
> 
> Etruscan art was strongly connected to religion; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.
