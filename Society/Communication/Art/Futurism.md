## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Futurism** (Italian: Futurismo [futuˈrizmo]) was an artistic and social movement 
> that originated in Italy, and to a lesser extent in other countries, in the early 20th century. 
> 
> It emphasized dynamism, speed, technology, youth, violence, 
> and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. 
> 
> Its key figures included Italian artists Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. Italian Futurism glorified modernity and, according to its doctrine, "aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past." Important Futurist works included Marinetti's 1909 Manifesto of Futurism, Boccioni's 1913 sculpture Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, Balla's 1913–1914 painting Abstract Speed + Sound, and Russolo's The Art of Noises (1913).
>
> Although Futurism was largely an Italian phenomenon, parallel movements emerged in Russia, 
> where some Russian Futurists would later go on to found groups of their own; 
> other countries either had a few Futurists or had movements inspired by Futurism. 
> 
> The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and  cooking.
>
> To some extent, Futurism influenced the art movements 
> - Art Deco, 
> - Constructivism, 
> - Surrealism, and 
> - Dada; to a greater degree, 
> - Precisionism, 
> - Rayonism, and 
> - Vorticism. 
> Passéism can represent an opposing trend or attitude.
