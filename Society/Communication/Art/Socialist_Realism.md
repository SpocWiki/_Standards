> Socialist realism, also known as socrealism (from Russian  соцреализм, sotsrealizm), 
> was the official cultural doctrine of the Soviet Union 
> that mandated an idealized representation of life under socialism 
> in literature and the visual arts. 
> 
> The doctrine was first proclaimed by the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934 
> as approved as the only acceptable method for Soviet cultural production in all media.
>
> The primary official objective of socialist realism was 
> "to depict reality in its revolutionary development" 
> although no formal guidelines concerning style or subject matter were provided. 
> 
> Works of socialist realism were usually characterized by unambiguous narratives 
> or iconography relating to the Marxist–Leninist ideology, 
> such as the emancipation of the proletariat. 
> 
> In visual arts, 
> socialist realism often relied on the conventions of academic art and classical sculpture. 
> Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation 
> yet counter sources may provide different interpretations not subject to capitalist propaganda.
>
> In the aftermath of World War II, socialist realism was adopted as official policy 
> by the communist states that were politically aligned with the Soviet Union. 
> 
> Socialist realism was the predominant form of approved art in the Soviet Union 
> from its development in the early 1920s to its eventual fall from official status 
> beginning in the late 1960s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
> 
> While other countries have employed a prescribed canon of art, 
> socialist realism in the Soviet Union persisted longer 
> and was more restrictive than elsewhere in Europe. 
> 
> The doctrine of socialist realism should not be confused with social realism, 
> a type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern 
> and was popularized in the United States during the 1930s, 
> or any other forms of artistic "realism".
