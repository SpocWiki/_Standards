## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The decorative arts are arts or crafts whose aim is the design and manufacture of objects 
> that are both beautiful and functional. 
> 
> This includes most of the objects for the interiors of buildings, as well as interior design, 
> but typically excludes architecture. 
> 
> Ceramic art, metalwork, furniture, jewellery, fashion, 
> various forms of the textile arts and glassware are major groupings.
>
> Applied arts largely overlap with the decorative arts, 
> and in modern parlance they are both often placed under the umbrella category of design. 
> 
> The decorative arts are often categorized in distinction to the "fine arts", 
> namely painting, drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, 
> which generally produce objects solely for their aesthetic quality and capacity to stimulate the intellect.
