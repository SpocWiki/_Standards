> **Sculpture** is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. 
> Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work 
> which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. 
> It is one of the plastic arts. 
> 
> Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) 
> and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood 
> and other materials but, since Modernism, 
> there has been almost complete freedom of materials and process. 
> 
> A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, 
> assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast.
>
> Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, 
> and often represents the majority of the surviving works 
> (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, 
> though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. 
> However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.
>
> Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, 
> and until recent centuries, large sculptures, 
> too expensive for private individuals to create, 
> were usually an expression of religion or politics. 
> Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include 
> - the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, 
> - India and China, as well as 
> - many in Central and South America and Africa.
>
> The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, 
> and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. 
> 
> During the Middle Ages, 
> Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. 
> 
> The revival of classical models in the Renaissance 
> produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo's statue of David. 
> 
> Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes 
> and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, 
> with the making of constructed sculpture, 
> and the presentation of found objects as finished artworks.
