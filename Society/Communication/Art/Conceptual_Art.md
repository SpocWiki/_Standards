> Conceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, 
> is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work are prioritized equally to 
> or more than traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. 
> 
> Some works of conceptual art may be constructed by anyone 
> simply by following a set of written instructions. 
> This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt's definition of conceptual art, 
> one of the first to appear in print:
>
> In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. 
> When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, 
> it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand 
> and the execution is a perfunctory affair. 
> The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.
>
> Tony Godfrey, author of Conceptual Art (Art & Ideas) (1998), asserts that 
> conceptual art questions the nature of art, 
> a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself 
> in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, Art after Philosophy (1969). 
> 
> The notion that art should examine its own nature 
> was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic 
> Clement Greenberg's vision of Modern art during the 1950s. 
> 
> With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, 
> conceptual artists such as Art & Language, Joseph Kosuth 
> (who became the American editor of Art-Language), 
> and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art 
> than was previously possible (see below). 
> 
> One of the first and most important things they questioned was 
> the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.
>
> Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, 
> in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, 
> "conceptual art" came to denote all contemporary art 
> that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. 
> 
> One of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be 
> associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms 
> lies in the problem of defining the term itself. 
> 
> As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining 
> why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, 
> and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". 
> 
> Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual 
> it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".
