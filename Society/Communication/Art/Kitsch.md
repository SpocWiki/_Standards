## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Kitsch** ( KICH; loanword from German) is a term applied to art and design 
> that is perceived as naïve imitation, overly eccentric, gratuitous or of banal taste. 
>
> The modern avant-garde traditionally opposed kitsch for its melodramatic tendencies, 
> its superficial relationship with the human condition and its naturalistic standards of beauty. 
> 
> In the first half of the 20th century, kitsch was used in reference to mass-produced, pop-cultural products that lacked the conceptual depth of fine art. However, since the emergence of Pop Art in the 1950s, kitsch has taken on newfound highbrow appeal, often wielded in knowingly ironic, humorous or earnest manners. 
>
> To brand visual art as "kitsch" is often still pejorative, though not exclusively. Art deemed kitsch may be enjoyed in an entirely positive and sincere manner. For example, it carries the ability to be quaint or "quirky" without being offensive on the surface, as in the Dogs Playing Poker paintings. 
>
> Along with visual art, the quality of kitsch can be used to describe works of music, literature or any other creative medium. Kitsch relates to camp, as they both incorporate irony and extravagance.
