## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Handicraft**  is a traditional main sector of craft making 
> and applies to a wide range of creative and design activities 
> that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work 
> with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, clay, etc. 
> 
> One of the oldest handicraft is Dhokra; this is a sort of metal casting 
> that has been used in India for over 5,000 years and is still used. 
> In Iranian Baluchistan, 
> women still make red ware hand-made pottery with dotted ornaments, 
> much similar to the 4,000-year-old pottery tradition of Kalpurgan, 
> an archaeological site near the village. 
> 
> Usually, the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items 
> (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic. 
> Handicraft industries are those that produce things with hands 
> to meet the needs of the people in their locality without using machines.
>
> Collective terms for handicrafts include artisanry, crafting, and handcrafting. 
> The term arts and crafts is also applied, especially in the United States 
> and mostly to hobbyists' and children's output rather than items crafted for daily use, 
> but this distinction is not formal, 
> and the term is easily confused with the Arts and Crafts design movement, 
> which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.
>
> Handicraft has its roots in the rural crafts—the material-goods necessities—
> of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, 
> while others are modern inventions or popularizations of crafts 
> which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.
>
> Many handcrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials 
> while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, 
> and even upcycle industrial materials. 
> The individual artisanship of a handcrafted item is the paramount criterion; 
> those made by mass production or machines are not handicraft goods.
>
> Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, 
> generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, 
> handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally. 
> 
> Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience 
> but can be learned by virtually anyone.
>
> Like folk art, handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, 
> and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in craftivism. 
> 
> Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), 
> spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, 
> then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.
