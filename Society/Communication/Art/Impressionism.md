> **Impressionism** was a 19th-century art movement 
> characterized by visible brush strokes, open composition, 
> emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities 
> (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, unusual visual angles, 
> and inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience. 
> 
> Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists 
> whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.
>
> The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. 
> The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, 
> Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), 
> which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical 1874 review of 
> the First Impressionist Exhibition published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari. 
> The development of Impressionism in the visual arts 
> was soon followed by analogous styles in other media 
> that became known as Impressionist music and Impressionist literature.
