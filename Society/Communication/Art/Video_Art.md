## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Video art is an art form which relies on using video technology as a visual and audio medium. 
> 
> Video art emerged during the late 1960s 
> as new consumer video technology such as video tape recorders became available outside corporate broadcasting. 
> 
> Video art can take many forms: recordings that are broadcast; 
> installations viewed in galleries or museums; works either streamed online, or distributed as video tapes, or on DVDs; and performances which may incorporate one or more television sets, video monitors, and projections, displaying live or recorded images and sounds. 
>
> Video art is named for the original analog video tape, 
> which was the most commonly used recording technology in much of the form's history into the 1990s. 
> 
> With the advent of digital recording equipment, many artists began to explore digital technology as a new way of expression. 
> 
> Video art does not necessarily rely on the conventions that define theatrical cinema. 
> 
> It may not use actors, may contain no dialogue, 
> and may have no discernible narrative or plot. 
> 
> Video art also differs from cinema subcategories such as 
> avant garde cinema, short films, and experimental film.
