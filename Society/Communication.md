# [[Communication]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Communication** is commonly defined as the transmission of information. 
> Its precise definition is disputed and there are disagreements about 
> whether unintentional or failed transmissions are included and 
> whether communication not only transmits meaning but also creates it. 
> 
> Models of communication are simplified overviews of its main components and their interactions. 
> Many models include the idea that a source uses a coding system 
> to express information in the form of a message. 
> The message is sent through a channel 
> to a receiver who has to decode it to understand it. 
> The main field of inquiry investigating communication is called communication studies.
>
> A common way to classify communication is by whether information is exchanged 
> - between humans, 
> - members of other species, or 
> - non-living entities such as computers. 
> 
> For human communication, a central contrast is 
> between verbal and non-verbal communication. 
> 
> Verbal communication involves the exchange of messages in linguistic form, 
> including spoken and written messages as well as sign language. 
> 
> Non-verbal communication happens without the use of a linguistic system, 
> for example, using body language, touch, and facial expressions. 
> 
> Another distinction is between interpersonal communication, 
> which happens between distinct persons, 
> and intrapersonal communication, which is communication with oneself. 
> 
> Communicative competence is the ability to communicate well 
> and applies to the skills of formulating messages and understanding them.
>
> Non-human forms of communication include animal and plant communication. 
> 
> Researchers in this field often refine their definition of communicative behavior 
> by including the criteria that observable responses are present 
> and that the participants benefit from the exchange. 
> 
> Animal communication is used in areas like courtship and mating, 
> parent–offspring relations, navigation, and self-defense. 
> 
> Communication through chemicals is important for the relatively immobile plants. 
> For example, maple trees release so-called volatile organic compounds into the air 
> to warn other plants of a herbivore attack. 
> 
> Most communication takes place between members of the same species. 
> 
> The reason is that its purpose is usually some form of cooperation, 
> which is not as common between different species. 
> 
> Interspecies communication happens mainly in cases of symbiotic relationships. 
> For instance, many flowers use symmetrical shapes and distinctive colors 
> to signal to insects where nectar is located. 
> Humans engage in interspecies communication 
> when interacting with pets and working animals.
>
> Human communication has a long history 
> and how people exchange information has changed over time. 
> These changes were usually 
> triggered by the development of new communication technologies. 
> 
> Examples are 
> - the invention of writing systems, 
> - the development of mass printing, 
> - the use of radio and television, and 
> - the invention of the internet. 
> 
> The technological advances also led to new forms of communication, 
> such as the exchange of data between computers.
