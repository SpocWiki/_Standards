> A **Ritual** is a repeated, structured sequence of actions or behaviors 
> that alters the internal or external state of an individual, group, or environment, 
> regardless of conscious understanding, emotional context, or symbolic meaning. 
> 
> Traditionally associated with gestures, words, or revered objects, 
> rituals also occur in non-human species, 
> such as elephant mourning or corvid object-leaving. 
> 
> They may be prescribed by tradition, including religious practices, and are often characterized by formalism, traditionalism, rule-governance, and performance.
>
> Rituals are a feature of all known human societies. 
> They include not only 
> the worship rites and sacraments of organized religions and cults, 
> but also rites of passage, atonement and purification rites, oaths of allegiance, dedication ceremonies, coronations and presidential inaugurations, marriages, funerals and more. 
> Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying "hello" may be termed as rituals.
>
> The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. 
> One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider's or "etic" category 
> for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, 
> seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. 
> 
> The term can be used also by the insider or "emic" performer as an 
> acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker.
>
> In psychology, the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense 
> for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person 
> to neutralize or prevent anxiety; 
> 
> it can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder 
> but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities, 
> not longer rituals.
