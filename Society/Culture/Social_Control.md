## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Social control is the regulations, sanctions, mechanisms, and systems 
> that restrict the behaviour of individuals in accordance with social norms and orders. 
> 
> Through both informal and formal means, 
> individuals and groups exercise social control both internally and externally. 
> As an area of social science, social control is studied by researchers of various fields, 
> including anthropology, criminology, law, political science, and sociology.
>
> Social control is considered one of the foundations of social order. 
> Sociologists identify two basic forms of social control. 
> 
> Informal means of control refer to 
> the internalization of norms and values through socialization. 
> 
> Formal means comprise external sanctions enforced by government 
> to prevent the establishment of chaos or anomie in society. 
> 
> Some theorists, such as Émile Durkheim, refer to formal control as regulation.
