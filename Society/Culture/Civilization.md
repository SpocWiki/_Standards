## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Civilization** (also spelled civilisation in British English) is any complex society 
> characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, 
> and symbolic systems of communication beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems).
>
> Civilizations are organized around densely-populated settlements (as with city-states), 
> divided into more or less rigid hierarchical social classes of division of labour, 
> often with a ruling elite and a subordinate urban and rural populations, 
> which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. 
> 
> Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of the nature, 
> including over other human beings. 
> 
> Civilizations are characterized with elaborate agriculture, architecture, infrastructure, 
> technological advancement, currency, taxation, regulation, and specialization of labour.
>
> Historically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, 
> in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly less advanced cultures, 
> even societies  within civilizations themselves and within their histories. 
> Generally civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, 
> including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies, or hunter-gatherers.
>
> The word civilization relates to the Latin civitas or 'city'. 
> As the National Geographic Society has explained it: 
> "This is why the most basic definition of the word civilization is 'a society made up of cities.'"
>
> The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with 
> the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia, 
> culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state formation, 
> a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.
