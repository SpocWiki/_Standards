> A **Cradle of civilization** is a location and a culture 
> where civilization was developed independently of other civilizations in other locations. 
> 
> A civilization is any complex society characterized by the development of the 
> state, social stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication 
> beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing systems and graphic arts).
>
> Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization: 
> - Mesopotamia, 
> - Ancient Egypt, 
> - Ancient India and 
> - Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in Afro-Eurasia, while 
> - the Caral–Supe civilization of coastal Peru and 
> - the Olmec civilization of Mexico are believed to be the earliest in the Americas. 
> 
> All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance 
> (except possibly Caral–Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). 
> 
> All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus 
> to support the centralized government, political leaders, religious leaders, 
> and public works of the urban centers of the early civilizations.
