## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Scouting** or the Scout Movement is a youth movement 
> which became popularly established in the first decade of the twentieth century. 
>
> It follows the Scout method of **informal education** 
> with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking and sports. 
> 
> A widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, 
> by intent hiding all differences of social standing and encouraging equality, 
> with neckerchief (known as a scarf in some countries) 
> and (originally) a campaign hat or comparable headwear. 
> 
> Distinctive insignia include the fleur-de-lis as well as merit badges or patches. 
> In many countries, girl only organizations, 
> whose members are often called Guides instead of Scouts, 
> use a trefoil insignia instead of the fleur-de-lis.
>
> The original program was for youths between the ages of 11 and 17.  
> Other programs for youths who are too young to be in the main program 
> and take the Scout Promise sometimes exist within an organization. 
> 
> Early examples are Wolf Cubs and Brownies.  Programs can also exist for those who are older.  Early examples are Rovers or Rangers.  The actual names or even existence depend on organization and time period. Speciality programs, such as Sea Scouts, exist.
>
> In 2019, there were over 55 million Scouts and Guides in at least 155 countries. 
> The Scout Movement is a pluralist movement, not a unitary organization. 
> 
> Numerous local, national and international Scout organizations have been formed. 
> The largest international organizations are 
> - the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) and 
> - the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS); 
> some national organization belong to both.
