> In education, a **Curriculum** (; pl.: curriculums or curricula ) is the totality of student experiences that occur in an educational process. The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals. A curriculum may incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content, materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of educational objectives. Curricula are split into several categories: the explicit, the implicit (including the hidden), the excluded, and the extracurricular.
>
> Curricula may be tightly standardized or may include a high level of instructor or learner autonomy.  Many countries have national curricula in primary and secondary education, such as the United Kingdom's National Curriculum.
>
> UNESCO's International Bureau of Education has the primary mission of studying curricula and their implementation worldwide.
