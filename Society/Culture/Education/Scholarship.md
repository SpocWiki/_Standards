> A **Scholarship** is a form of financial aid awarded to students for further education. 
> Generally, scholarships are awarded based on a set of criteria such as 
> academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need, 
> research experience or specific professional experience. 
>
> Scholarship criteria usually reflect the values and goals of the donor of the award. 
> While scholarship recipients are not required to repay scholarships, 
> the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements 
> during their period of support, such as maintaining a minimum grade point average 
> or engaging in a certain activity (e.g., playing on a school sports team for athletic scholarship holders). 
>
> Scholarships also range in generosity; some cover partial tuition, 
> while others offer a 'full-ride', covering all tuition, accommodation, housing and others.
>
> Historically, scholarships originated as acts of religious and philanthropic charity 
> in medieval Europe before 
> evolving into institutional tools of social mobility and national development. 
> 
> From early support offered at universities 
> such as the University of Bologna and Harvard University 
> to the standardized merit-based aid of the 20th century, 
> scholarships reflect evolving educational priorities.
>
> In recent decades, scholarships have also become vital to public policy. 
> They are increasingly used by governments and organizations 
> to promote educational equity, economic development, and poverty alleviation. 
> 
> International frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 
> note the key role of scholarships in expanding educational access for disadvantaged learners 
> to meet national and global development goals. 
> 
> At the same time, rising enrollment and reduced public funding 
> has increased reliance on donor-supported scholarships and cost-sharing models, 
> which further position scholarships as essential mechanisms 
> in offsetting the burden of educational expenses.
>
> Some prestigious, highly competitive scholarships are well-known 
> even outside the academic community, 
> such as Fulbright Scholarship and the Rhodes Scholarships at the graduate level, 
> and the Robertson, Morehead-Cain and Jefferson Scholarships at the undergraduate level.
