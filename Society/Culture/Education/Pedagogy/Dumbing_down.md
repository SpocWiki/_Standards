## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dumbing down** is the deliberate oversimplification of intellectual content in 
> education, literature, cinema, news, video games, and culture. 
> 
> Originating in 1933, the term "dumbing down" was movie-business slang, 
> used by screenplay writers, meaning: "[to] revise so as 
> to appeal to those of little education or intelligence". 
> 
> Dumbing-down varies according to subject matter, and usually involves the 
> diminishment of critical thought 
> by undermining standard language and learning standards, thus 
> trivializing academic standards, culture, and meaningful information, 
> as in the case of popular culture.
