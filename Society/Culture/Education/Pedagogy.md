## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Pedagogy**, most commonly understood as the approach to teaching, 
> is the theory and practice of learning, and how this process influences, 
> and is influenced by, the social, political, and psychological development of learners. 
> 
> Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of 
> how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, 
> and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. 
> 
> Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly 
> as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.
>
> Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching. 
> The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, 
> and teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning, 
> understandings of students and their needs, 
> and the backgrounds and interests of individual students. 
> 
> Its aims may range from furthering liberal education 
> (the general development of human potential) 
> to the narrower specifics of vocational education 
> (the imparting and acquisition of specific skills).
>
> Instructive strategies are governed by the 
> pupil's background knowledge and experience, situation and environment, 
> as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. 
> 
> One example would be the Socratic method.
