> Primary education is the first stage of formal education, 
> coming after preschool/kindergarten and before secondary education. 
> 
> Primary education takes place in primary schools, elementary schools, 
> or first schools and middle schools, depending on the location. 
> 
> Hence, in the United Kingdom and some other countries, 
> the term primary is used instead of elementary.
>
> There is no commonly agreed on duration of primary education, 
> but often three to six years of elementary school, 
> and in some countries (like the US) the first seven to nine years are considered primary education.
>
> The International Standard Classification of Education considers primary education as a single phase 
> where programs are typically designed to provide fundamental reading, writing, 
> and mathematics skills and establish a solid foundation for learning. 
> 
> This is ISCED Level 1: Primary education or the first stage of basic education.
