> The Socratic method (also known as the method of Elenchus or Socratic debate) 
> is a form of argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions. 
> 
> Socratic dialogues feature in many of the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, 
> where his teacher Socrates debates various philosophical issues with an "interlocutor" or "partner".
>
> In Plato's dialogue "Theaetetus", 
> Socrates describes his method as a form of "midwifery", 
> because it is employed to help his interlocutors develop their understanding 
> in a way analogous to a child developing in the womb. 
> 
> The Socratic method begins with commonly held beliefs 
> and scrutinizes them by way of questioning 
> to determine their internal consistency and their coherence with other beliefs 
> and so to bring everyone closer to the [[../../../../Philosophy/Epistemology/Truth|truth]].
>
> In modified forms, it is employed today in a variety of pedagogical contexts.
