> In the sociology of culture, a **Subculture** is a group of people within a cultural society 
> that differentiates itself from the values of the mainstream or dominant culture to which it belongs, 
> often maintaining some of its founding principles. 
> 
> Subcultures develop their own norms and values regarding cultural, political, and sexual matters. 
> Subcultures coexist within mainstream society while keeping their specific characteristics intact.
>
> Since its inception in the English-speaking world (primarily North America and the United Kingdom) during the 1940s–1950s, the concept and study of subcultures was developed in the academic fields of sociology, communication studies, and cultural studies. Examples of subcultures include punks, skinheads, Teddy Boys, mods, rockers, bikers, hip-hoppers, and more. Subcultures differ from countercultures.
