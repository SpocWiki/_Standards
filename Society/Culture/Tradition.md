## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **tradition** is a system of beliefs or behaviors (folk custom) 
> passed down within a group of people or society 
> with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. 
> 
> A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include 
> holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes 
> (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), 
> but the idea has also been applied to social norms and behaviors 
> such as greetings, etc. 
> 
> Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years— 
> the word tradition itself derives from the Latin  word tradere 
> literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. 
> 
> While it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, 
> many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether it be political or cultural, 
> over short periods of time. 
> 
> Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.
>
> The phrase "according to tradition" or "by tradition" 
> usually means that what follows is known only through oral tradition 
> and is not supported (and might even be refuted) by solid evidence. 
> 
> Here, "tradition" describes the source or nature of the information. 
> For example, "According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, 
> but many other places have historically claimed him as theirs." 
> This tradition may never be proven or disproved. 
> 
> Another example is, "King Arthur, according to history, a true British king, 
> has inspired many well loved stories." Whether the claims are supported by evidence or not does not reduce their value as cultural history and literature.
> 
>
> Traditions are subject of study in several academic fields of learning, 
> especially in the humanities and social sciences, including 
> anthropology, archaeology, history, and sociology.
>
> The conceptualization of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, 
> is also found in political and philosophical discourse. 
> 
> For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, 
> and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. 
> 
> In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. 
> For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), 
> adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed 
> are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. 
> 
> A host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, 
> globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. 
> 
> In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts and initiatives 
> have now been started in many countries around the world, 
> focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. 
> 
> Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity 
> and should be differentiated from 
> customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.
