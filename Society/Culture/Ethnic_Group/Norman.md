> The **Normans** (Norman: Normaunds; French: Normands; Latin: Nortmanni/Normanni) 
> were a population arising in the medieval Duchy of Normandy 
> from the intermingling between Norse Viking settlers and locals of West Francia. 
> 
> The Norse settlements in West Francia 
> followed a series of raids on the French northern coast mainly from what is now Denmark, 
> although some also sailed from Norway and Sweden. 
> 
> These settlements were finally legitimized when Rollo, a Scandinavian Viking leader, 
> agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia 
> following the siege of Chartres in 911, leading to the formation of the County of Rouen. 
> 
> This new fief, through kinship in the decades to come, would expand into 
> what came to be known as the Duchy of Normandy. 
> 
> The Norse settlers, whom the region as well as its inhabitants were named after, 
> adopted the language, religion, social customs and martial doctrine of the West Franks 
> but their offspring nonetheless retained many of their traits, 
> notably their mercenary tendencies and their fervour for adventures. 
> 
> The intermixing between Norse folk and native West Franks in Normandy 
> produced an ethnic and cultural "Norman" identity in the first half of the 10th century, 
> an identity which continued to evolve over the centuries.
>
> The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact 
> on medieval Europe and the Near East. 
> 
> The Normans were historically famed for their martial spirit, 
> and eventually for their Catholic piety 
> as adherents of the Catholic orthodoxy of the Romance community. 
> 
> The original Norse settlers adopted the Gallo-Romance language 
> of the Frankish land they settled, 
> with their Old Norman dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, 
> an important literary language which is still spoken today in parts of mainland Normandy 
> (Cotentinais and Cauchois dialects) and the nearby Channel Islands (Jèrriais and Guernésiais). 
> 
> The Duchy of Normandy, which arose from the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, 
> was a great fief of medieval France. 
> The Norman dukes exercised independent control of their holdings in Normandy, 
> while at the same time being vassals owing fealty to the King of France, 
> and under Richard I of Normandy (byname Richard sans Peur, meaning "Richard the Fearless"), the duchy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.
>
> Between 1066 and 1204, as a result of the Norman conquest of England, 
> most of the kings of England were also dukes of Normandy. 
> 
> Gradually, an Anglo-Norman culture developed in the British Isles. 
> In 1204, Philip II of France seized mainland Normandy by force of arms, 
> having earlier declared the Duchy of Normandy to be forfeit to him. 
> 
> It remained a disputed territory until the Treaty of Paris of 1259, 
> when the English sovereign ceded his claim to the Duchy, except for the Channel Islands. 
> In the present day, the Channel Islands (the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey) 
> are considered to be officially the last remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, 
> and are not part of the United Kingdom but are instead self-governing Crown Dependencies.
>
> The Normans are noted both for their culture, 
> such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, 
> and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. 
> 
> Norman adventurers played a role in founding the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II 
> after conquering southern Italy and Malta from the Saracens and Byzantines, 
> and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, 
> led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. 
> Norman and Anglo-Norman forces contributed to the Iberian Reconquista 
> from the early eleventh to the mid-thirteenth centuries.
>
> Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres 
> to the Crusader states of the Near East, 
> where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, 
> to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, 
> and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands. 
> 
> The legacy of the Normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects 
> of France, England, Spain, Quebec and Sicily, 
> and also through the various cultural, judicial, and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories.
