## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Juice** is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained 
> in fruit and vegetables. 
> It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, 
> such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage 
> or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. 
> 
> Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice 
> after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation 
> (which is used in wine production). 
> The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) 
> and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). 
> Fruit juice consumption on average increases with a country's income level.
