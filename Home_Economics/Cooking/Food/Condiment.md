> A **Condiment** is a preparation that is added to food, typically after cooking, to impart a specific flavour, 
> to enhance the flavour, or to complement the dish. 
>
> Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavour texture: barbecue sauce, compound butter, 
> teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, Marmite and sour cream are examples. 
>
> Alternatively, condiments are sometimes added prior to serving, 
> for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. 
>
> A table condiment or table sauce is served separately from the food and added to taste by the diner. 
> Many, such as mustard or ketchup, are available in single-serving packets, 
> commonly when supplied with take-out or fast food meals.
