## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In economics, **Inflation** is an increase in the average price of goods and services in terms of money.  
> This increase is measured using a price index, typically a consumer price index (CPI). 
> When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; 
> consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money. 
> The opposite of CPI inflation is deflation, a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. 
> The common measure of inflation is the inflation rate, 
> the annualized percentage change in a general price index.
>
> Changes in inflation are widely attributed to 
> - fluctuations in real __demand__ for goods and services (also known as demand shocks, including changes in fiscal or monetary policy), 
> - changes in available __supplies__ such as during energy crises (also known as supply shocks), or 
> - changes in inflation __expectations__, which may be self-fulfilling. 
> 
> Moderate inflation affects economies in both positive and negative ways. 
> The negative effects would include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money; 
> uncertainty over future inflation, which may discourage investment and savings; 
> and, if inflation were rapid enough, shortages of goods 
> as consumers begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future. 
> 
> Positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity,  
> allowing the central bank greater freedom in carrying out monetary policy, encouraging loans 
> and investment instead of money hoarding, and avoiding the inefficiencies associated with deflation.
>
> Today, most economists favour a low and steady rate of inflation. 
> Low (as opposed to zero or negative) inflation reduces the probability of economic recessions 
> by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn 
> and reduces the risk that a liquidity trap prevents monetary policy from stabilizing the economy 
> while avoiding the costs associated with high inflation. 
> 
> The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to 
> central banks that control monetary policy, normally through the setting of interest rates 
> and by carrying out open market operations.
