> Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, first published in 2012, 
> is a book by economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, who jointly 
> received the 2024 [[../../International/NGO/Nobel_Prize/Economy_Nobel_Prize|Nobel Economics Prize]] (alongside Simon Johnson) 
> for their contribution in comparative studies of prosperity between nations. 
> 
> The book applies insights from institutional economics, development economics, 
> and economic history to understand why nations develop differently, 
> with some succeeding in the accumulation of power and prosperity 
> and others failing, according to a wide range of historical case studies.

> about the ongoing discussion of the book.
