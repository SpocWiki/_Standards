## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Crop** is a plant that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence.  In other words, a crop is a plant or plant product that is grown for a specific purpose such as food, fibre, or fuel. 
>
> When plants of the same species are cultivated in rows or other systematic arrangements, it is called crop field or crop cultivation.
>
> Most crops are harvested as food for humans or fodder for livestock.
>
> Important non-food crops include horticulture, floriculture, and industrial crops. Horticulture crops include plants used for other crops (e.g. fruit trees). Floriculture crops include bedding plants, houseplants, flowering garden and pot plants, cut cultivated greens, and cut flowers. Industrial crops are produced for clothing (fiber crops e.g. cotton), biofuel (energy crops, algae fuel), or medicine (medicinal plants).
