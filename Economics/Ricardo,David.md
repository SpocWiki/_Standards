> **David Ricardo** (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, politician, 
> and member of Parliament. He is recognized as one of the most influential classical economists, 
> alongside figures such as Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.
>
> Ricardo was born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife. 
> He came from a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin. 
> 
> At 21, he eloped with a Quaker and converted to Unitarianism, causing estrangement from his family. 
> He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in Gloucestershire. 
> Ricardo served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and bought a seat in Parliament as a reformer. 
> He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus, 
> engaging in debates over various topics. 
> Ricardo was also a member of The Geological Society, and his youngest sister was an author.
>
> As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, 
> including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. 
> He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. 
> Ricardo notably opposed the Corn Laws, which he saw as barriers to economic growth. 
> His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo's conviction in his beliefs, 
> though he expressed doubts about Ricardo's disregard for experience and practice. 
> Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). 
> He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, 
> with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.
>
> Ricardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, 
> advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. 
> He was also an abolitionist and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. 
> Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith's labour theory of value, 
> stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. 
> He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, 
> defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained 
> by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. 
> Ricardo's Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, 
> real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.
>
> Ricardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilist concept of 
> accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. 
> Ricardo introduced the concept of "comparative advantage", 
> suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries 
> where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. 
> He argued that international trade is always beneficial, 
> even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. 
> Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies 
> and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.
