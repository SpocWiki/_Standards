## British Agricultural Revolution
(17th–19th century), 
an unprecedented increase in agricultural productivity in Great Britain 
(also known as the Second Agricultural Revolution)

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **British Agricultural Revolution**, or Second Agricultural Revolution, 
> was an unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain 
> arising from increases in labor and land productivity 
> between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. 
> 
> Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the hundred-year period 
> ending in 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. 
> This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population 
> in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, 
> though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports 
> in the 19th century as the population more than tripled to over 35 million.
>
> Using 1700 as a base year (=100), agricultural output per agricultural worker 
> in Britain steadily increased from about 50 in 1500, to around 65 in 1550, 
> to 90 in 1600, to over 100 by 1650, to over 150 by 1750, 
> rapidly increasing to over 250 by 1850. 
> The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the 
> agricultural share of the labour force, 
> adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: 
> the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been 
> cited as a cause of the Industrial Revolution.
>
> However, historians continue to 
> dispute when exactly such a "revolution" took place and of what it consisted. 
> Rather than a single event, G. E. Mingay states that there were a 
> "profusion of agricultural revolutions, one for two centuries before 1650, 
> another emphasising the century after 1650, a third for the period 1750–1780, 
> and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century". 
> This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements 
> about "the Agricultural Revolution" are difficult to sustain.
>
> One important change in farming methods was 
> the __move in crop rotation to turnips and clover in place of fallow__ 
> under the Norfolk four-course system. 
> Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep-rooted, 
> allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow-rooted crops. 
> Clover fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. 
> This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms 
> and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers 
> whose manure added further to soil fertility.
