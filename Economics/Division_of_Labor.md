Initially proposed by [[../bio/People/Economist/Smith,Adam|Adam Smith]], who argued that 
assigning specialized tasks to different workers increases total output 
by enhancing dexterity, saving time, and fostering innovation.
This marked the switch from craftsman to (un-)skilled Worker 
and from Workshop to Manufacturing and Factories and eventually Assembly Lines. 
The concrete example was making needles. 

[[Ricardo,David]]'s Theory of Comparative Advantage in addition proves that, 
Specialization and international Trade is always beneficial, 
even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart.
