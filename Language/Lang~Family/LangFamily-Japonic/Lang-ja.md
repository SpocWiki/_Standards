> Japanese (日本語, Nihongo, [ɲihoŋɡo] ) 
> is the principal language of the Japonic language family spoken by the Japanese people. 
> 
> It has around 128 million speakers, primarily in Japan, 
> the only country where it is the national language, 
> and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide. 
>
> The Japonic family also includes the Ryukyuan languages 
> and the variously classified Hachijō language. 
> 
> There have been many attempts to group the Japonic languages with other families such as the Ainu, Austroasiatic, Koreanic, and the now-discredited Altaic, 
> but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance.
>
> Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. 
> Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, 
> but substantial Old Japanese texts did not appear until the 8th century. 
> 
> From the Heian period (794–1185), 
> extensive waves of Sino-Japanese vocabulary entered the language, 
> affecting the phonology of Early Middle Japanese. 
> 
> Late Middle Japanese (1185–1600) saw extensive grammatical changes 
> and the first appearance of European loanwords. 
> 
> The basis of the standard dialect moved from the Kansai region 
> to the Edo region (modern Tokyo) 
> in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century–mid 19th century). 
> 
> Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, 
> the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly, 
> and words from English roots have proliferated.
>
> Japanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with relatively simple phonotactics, 
> a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, 
> and a lexically significant pitch-accent. 
> 
> Word order is normally subject–object–verb 
> with particles marking the grammatical function of words, 
> and sentence structure is topic–comment. 
> 
> Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or form questions. 
> Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. 
> Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. 
> Japanese adjectives are also conjugated. 
> Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, with verb forms and vocabulary 
> to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.
>
> The Japanese writing system combines 
> Chinese characters, known as kanji (漢字, 'Han characters'), 
> with two unique syllabaries (or moraic scripts) 
> derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: 
> hiragana (ひらがな or 平仮名, 'simple characters') and 
> katakana (カタカナ or 片仮名, 'partial characters'). 
> Latin script (rōmaji ローマ字) is also used in a limited fashion 
> (such as for imported acronyms) in Japanese writing. 
> 
> The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals, but also traditional Chinese numerals.
