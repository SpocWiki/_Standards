> The **Ugric** or Ugrian languages are a branch of the Uralic language family.
>
> Ugric includes three subgroups: Hungarian, Khanty, and Mansi. 
> The latter two are traditionally considered to be single languages, 
> though they are sometimes considered to be small subdivisions of the Ugric language family 
> due to considerable dialectical differences. 
> 
> A common Proto-Ugric language is posited to have been spoken 
> from the end of the 3rd millennium BC until the first half of the 1st millennium BC, 
> in Western Siberia, east of the southern Ural Mountains. 
> 
> Of the three languages, Khanty and Mansi have sometimes been set apart from Hungarian 
> as Ob-Ugric, though features uniting Mansi and Hungarian in particular are known as well.
>
> The name Ugric is derived from ugry (угры), a Russian exonym of the Magyars (Hungarians) and also the name of the historical northern Russian region of Yugra. A connection between these words was first suggested in the beginning of 16th century. However, according to István Vásáry the etymological connection between these two words has not been verified, and the name Ugric is based on a folk etymology.
