> Wu (traditional Chinese: 吳語; simplified Chinese: 吴语; 
> Wu romanization and IPA: wu6 gniu6 [ɦu˩˩˧.n̠ʲy˩˩˧] (Shanghainese), 
> ghou2 gniu6 [ɦou˨˨˦.n̠ʲy˨˧˩] (Suzhounese), Mandarin Wúyǔ [u³⁵ y²¹⁴]) 
> is a major group of Sinitic languages spoken primarily in Shanghai, Zhejiang Province, 
> and the part of Jiangsu Province south of the Yangtze River, 
> which makes up the cultural region of Wu. 
> 
> Speakers of various Wu languages sometimes 
> labelled their mother tongue as Shanghainese when introduced to foreigners. 
> 
> The Suzhou dialect was the prestige dialect of Wu as of the 19th century, 
> but had been replaced in status by Shanghainese by the turn of the 20th century. 
> The languages of Northern Wu are mutually intelligible with each other, 
> while those of Southern Wu are not.
>
> Historical linguists view Wu of great significance 
> because it distinguished  itself from other varieties of Chinese 
> by preserving the voiced initials of the ancient Middle Chinese 
> and by preserving the checked tone as a glottal stop. 
> 
> The phonological divergence between Wu and other Chinese is significant, 
> for instance, the phrase "Shanghainese language" (上海閒話; 上海闲话) 
> is pronounced as [zɑ̃.he̞ ɦe̞.ɦo] in Shanghainese 
> and [ʂaŋ.xaɪ.ɕjɛn.xwa] in Beijing Mandarin. 
> 
> Wu and the Suzhou dialect in particular 
> is perceived as soft in the ears of Mandarin speakers; 
> hence there is the idiom "the tender speech of Wu" (吳儂軟語; 吴侬软语).
>
> The __decline of Wu began from around 1986__, 
> when students were banned from speaking "uncivilized dialects" during class, 
> a term used by the State Language Commission to refer to all Chinese languages 
> other than Standard Chinese. 
> In 1992, students in Shanghai were banned from speaking Wu at all times on campuses. 
> Since the late 2000s, Wu mostly survived in kitchens and theatres, 
> as a "kitchen language" among the elderly housewives 
> and as a theatrical language in folk Yue opera, Shanghai opera and Pingtan. 
> As of now, Wu has no official status, no legal protection 
> and there is no officially sanctioned romanization.
