> Chinese (simplified Chinese: 汉语; traditional Chinese: 漢語; pinyin: Hànyǔ; lit. 'Han language' or 中文; Zhōngwén; 'Chinese writing') 
> is a group of languages spoken natively by the ethnic Han Chinese majority 
> and many minority ethnic groups in China. 
> Approximately 1.3 billion people, or around 16% of the global population, 
> speak a variety of Chinese as their first language.
>
> Chinese languages form the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. 
> The spoken varieties of Chinese are usually considered by native speakers 
> to be dialects of a single language. 
> However, their lack of mutual intelligibility means they are sometimes considered to be 
> separate languages in a family. 
> Investigation of the historical relationships among the varieties of Chinese is ongoing. 
> 
> Currently, most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups 
> based on phonetic developments from Middle Chinese, 
> of which the most spoken by far is Mandarin with 66%, or around 800 million speakers, 
> followed by Min (75 million, e.g. Southern Min), 
> Wu (74 million, e.g. Shanghainese), and 
> Yue (68 million, e.g. Cantonese). 
> 
> These branches are unintelligible to each other, 
> and many of their subgroups are unintelligible with the other varieties 
> within the same branch (e.g. Southern Min). 
> 
> There are, however, transitional areas where varieties from different branches 
> share enough features for some limited intelligibility, 
> including New Xiang with Southwestern Mandarin, 
> Xuanzhou Wu Chinese with Lower Yangtze Mandarin, 
> Jin with Central Plains Mandarin and certain divergent dialects of Hakka with Gan 
> (though these are unintelligible with mainstream Hakka). 
> All varieties of Chinese are tonal to at least some degree, and are largely analytic.
>
> The earliest Chinese written records are oracle bone inscriptions 
> dating from the Shang dynasty c. 1250 BCE. 
> The phonetic categories of Old Chinese can be reconstructed 
> from the rhymes of ancient poetry. 
> 
> During the Northern and Southern period, 
> Middle Chinese went through several sound changes and split into several varieties 
> following prolonged geographic and political separation. 
> 
> The Qieyun, a rime dictionary, recorded a compromise 
> between the pronunciations of different regions. 
> 
> The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated 
> using a koiné language known as Guanhua, based on the Nanjing dialect of Mandarin.
>
> Standard Chinese is an official language of both the People's Republic of China 
> and the Republic of China (Taiwan), one of the four official languages of Singapore, 
> and one of the six official languages of the United Nations. 
> 
> Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, 
> and was first officially adopted in the 1930s. 
> 
> The language is written primarily using a logography of Chinese characters, 
> largely shared by readers who may otherwise speak mutually unintelligible varieties. 
> 
> Since the 1950s, the use of Simplified characters 
> has been promoted by the government of the People's Republic of China, 
> with Singapore officially adopting them in 1976. 
> 
> Traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, 
> and among Chinese-speaking communities overseas. 
> 
> Traditional characters are also in use in mainland China, 
> despite them not being the first choice in daily use. 
> For example, practicing Chinese calligraphy 
> requires the knowledge of traditional Chinese characters.
