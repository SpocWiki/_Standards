> Yue (Cantonese pronunciation: [jyːt̚˨]) is a branch of the Sinitic languages 
> primarily spoken in Southern China, 
> particularly in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi 
> (collectively known as Liangguang).
>
> The term Cantonese is often used to refer to the whole branch, 
> but linguists prefer to reserve the name Cantonese 
> for the variety used in Guangzhou (Canton), Wuzhou (Ngchow), Hong Kong and Macau, 
> which is the prestige dialect of the group. 
> 
> Taishanese, from the coastal area of Jiangmen (Kongmoon) 
> located southwest of Guangzhou, 
> was the language of most of the 19th-century emigrants 
> from Guangdong to Southeast Asia and North America. 
> Most later migrants have been speakers of Cantonese.
>
> Yue varieties are not mutually intelligible with other varieties of Chinese, 
> and they are not mutually intelligible within the Yue family either. 
> 
> They are among the most conservative varieties 
> with regard to the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, 
> but have lost several distinctions in the initial consonants and medial glides 
> that other Chinese varieties have retained.
