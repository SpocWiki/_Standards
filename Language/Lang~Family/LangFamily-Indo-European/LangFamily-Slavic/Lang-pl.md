> Polish (endonym: język polski, [ˈjɛ̃zɨk ˈpɔlskʲi] , 
> polszczyzna [pɔlˈʂt͡ʂɨzna]  or simply polski, [ˈpɔlskʲi] ) 
> is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group 
> within the Indo-European language family written in the Latin script. 
> 
> It is spoken primarily in Poland and serves as the native language of the Poles. 
> In addition to being the official language of Poland, it is also used by the Polish diaspora. 
> There are over 50 million Polish speakers around the world. 
> 
> It ranks as the sixth most-spoken among languages of the European Union. 
> Polish is subdivided into regional dialects and maintains strict T–V distinction pronouns, 
> honorifics, and various forms of formalities when addressing individuals.
> 
> The traditional 32-letter Polish alphabet has nine additions (ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż) 
> to the letters of the basic 26-letter Latin alphabet, while removing three (x, q, v). 
> 
> Those three letters are at times included in an extended 35-letter alphabet, 
> although they are not used in native words. 
> 
> The traditional set comprises 23 consonants and 9 written vowels, 
> including two nasal vowels (ę, ą) defined by a reversed diacritic hook called an ogonek. 
> 
> Polish is a synthetic and fusional language which has seven grammatical cases. 
> It is one of very few languages in the world possessing continuous penultimate stress 
> (with only a few exceptions) and the only in its group 
> having an abundance of palatal consonants. 
> 
> Contemporary Polish developed in the 1700s 
> as the successor to the medieval Old Polish (10th–16th centuries) 
> and Middle Polish (16th–18th centuries). 
> 
> Among the major languages, it is most closely related to Slovak and Czech 
> but differs in terms of pronunciation and general grammar. 
> In addition, Polish was profoundly influenced by Latin and other Romance languages 
> like Italian and French as well as Germanic languages (most notably German), 
> which contributed to a large number of loanwords and similar grammatical structures. 
> 
> Extensive usage of nonstandard dialects has also shaped the standard language; 
> considerable colloquialisms and expressions were 
> directly borrowed from German or Yiddish 
> and subsequently adopted into the vernacular of Polish which is in everyday use. 
> 
> Historically, Polish was a lingua franca, important both diplomatically and academically 
> in Central and part of Eastern Europe. 
> 
> Today, Polish is spoken by approximately 38 million people as their first language in Poland. 
> It is also spoken as a second language in eastern Germany, northern Czech Republic 
> and Slovakia, western parts of Belarus and Ukraine as well as in southeast Lithuania and Latvia. 
> 
> Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods, 
> most notably after World War II, millions of Polish speakers can also be found 
> in countries such as Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Australia, 
> the United Kingdom and the United States.
