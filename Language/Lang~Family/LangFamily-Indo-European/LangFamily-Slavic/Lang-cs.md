> Czech (endonym: čeština [ˈtʃɛʃcɪna]), 
> historically also known as Bohemian (; Latin: lingua Bohemica), 
> is a West Slavic language of the Czech–Slovak group, written in Latin script. 
> 
> Spoken by over 10 million people, 
> it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. 
> Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of high mutual intelligibility, 
> as well as to Polish to a lesser degree. 
> 
> Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology 
> and relatively flexible word order. 
> Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German.
>
> The Czech–Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, 
> and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech–Slovak dialect continuum 
> emerged in the early modern period. 
> 
> In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified 
> in the context of the Czech National Revival. 
> 
> The most widely spoken non-standard variety, known as Common Czech, 
> is based on the vernacular of Prague, 
> but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of Bohemia. 
> 
> The dialects spoken in Moravia are considerably more varied 
> than the dialects of Bohemia. 
> 
> A popular misconception holds 
> that eastern Moravian dialects are closer to Slovak than Czech, but this is incorrect; 
> in fact, the opposite is true, and certain dialects in far western Slovakia 
> exhibit features more akin to standard Czech than to standard Slovak. 
> 
> Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants (divided into "hard", "neutral" and "soft" categories). 
> 
> Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. 
> Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is known to occur as a phoneme 
> in only a few other languages, represented by the grapheme ř.
