> Catalan (català) is a Western Romance language and is the official language of Andorra, 
> and the official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: 
> - Catalonia, 
> - the Balearic Islands 
> - and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valencià). 
> It has semi-official status in the Italian municipality of Alghero, 
> and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France 
> and in two further areas in eastern Spain: 
> - the eastern strip of Aragon and 
> - the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. 
> The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Països Catalans or "Catalan Countries".
>
> The language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. 
> It became the language of the Principality of Catalonia and the kingdoms of Valencia and Mallorca, 
> being present throughout the Mediterranean. 
> 
> It was replaced by Spanish as a language of government and literature in the 1700s, 
> but nineteenth century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s. 
> 
> With the end of Franco dictatorship (1975) and its repressive measures against the language, 
> Catalan entered in a relatively successful process of re-normalization 
> between the 1980s and the 2000s. 
> 
> However, during the 2010s, it experienced signs of decline in social use, diglossia 
> and the re-growth of discrimination cases.
