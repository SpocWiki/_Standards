## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Altaic** languages was a proposed, now **obsolete widely rejected language family**, 
> comprising the Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic language families, 
> with some linguists having included the Koreanic and Japonic families. 
> 
> The proposed Altaic language family is no longer considered valid, 
> as linguistic similarities among Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages 
> are better explained by areal convergence within a Sprachbund, 
> rather than by a shared genetic lineageâ€”
> a phenomenon observed cross-linguistically in diverse language families worldwide.
>
> These languages share 
> - agglutinative morphology, 
> - head-final word order and some 
> - vocabulary. 
> 
> The once-popular theory attributing these similarities to a common ancestry 
> has long been rejected by most comparative linguists in favor of language contact, 
> although it continues to be supported by a small but stable scholarly minority. 
> 
> Like the Uralic language family, which is named after the Ural Mountains, 
> the group is named after the Altai mountain range in the center of Asia. 
> The core grouping of Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic is sometimes called "Micro-Altaic", 
> with the expanded group including Koreanic and Japonic labelled as "Macro-Altaic" or "Transeurasian".

> The Altaic family was first proposed in the 18th century. It was widely accepted until the 1960s and is still listed in many encyclopedias and handbooks, and references to Altaic as a language family continue to percolate to modern sources through these older sources. Since the 1950s, most comparative linguists have rejected the proposal, after supposed cognates were found not to be valid, hypothesized sound shifts were not found, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were found to have been converging rather than diverging over the centuries. The relationship between the Altaic languages is now generally accepted to be the result of a sprachbund rather than common ancestry, with the languages showing influence from prolonged contact.

> Altaic has maintained a limited degree of scholarly support, in contrast to some other early macrofamily proposals. Continued research on Altaic is still being undertaken by a core group of academic linguists, but their research has not found wider support. In particular it has support from the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and remains influential as a substratum of Turanism, where a hypothetical common linguistic ancestor has been used in part as a basis for a multiethnic nationalist movement.
