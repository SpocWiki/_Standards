## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Sino-Tibetan (also referred to as Trans-Himalayan) is a family of more than 400 languages, 
> second only to Indo-European in number of native speakers. 
> Around 1.4 billion people speak a Sino-Tibetan language. 
> The vast majority of these are the 1.3 billion native speakers of Sinitic languages. 
> Other **Sino-Tibetan languages** with large numbers of speakers include Burmese (33 million) 
> and the Tibetic languages (6 million). 
> 
> Four United Nations member states (China, Singapore, Myanmar, and Bhutan) 
> have a Sino-Tibetan language as a main native language. 
> Other languages of the family are spoken in the Himalayas, the Southeast Asian Massif, 
> and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. 
> Most of these have small speech communities in remote mountain areas, 
> and as such are poorly documented.
>
> Several low-level subgroups have been securely reconstructed, but reconstruction of a proto-language for the family as a whole is still at an early stage, so the higher-level structure of Sino-Tibetan remains unclear. Although the family is traditionally presented as divided into Sinitic (i.e. Chinese languages) and Tibeto-Burman branches, a common origin of the non-Sinitic languages has never been demonstrated. The Kra–Dai and Hmong–Mien languages are generally included within Sino-Tibetan by Chinese linguists but have been excluded by the international community since the 1940s. Several links to other language families have been proposed, but none have broad acceptance.
