> Coptic (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, romanized: Timetremənkʰēmi) is a dormant Afroasiatic language. 
> It is a group of closely related Egyptian dialects, 
> representing the most recent developments of the Egyptian language, 
> and historically spoken by the Copts, starting from the third century AD in Roman Egypt. 
> Coptic was supplanted by Arabic as the primary spoken language of Egypt 
> following the Arab conquest of Egypt and was slowly replaced over the centuries.
>
> Coptic has no modern-day native speakers, and no fluent speakers apart from a number of priests, 
> although it remains in daily use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church 
> and of the Coptic Catholic Church. It is written with the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with seven additional letters borrowed from the Demotic Egyptian script.

> The major Coptic dialects are Sahidic, Bohairic, Akhmimic, Fayyumic, Lycopolitan (Asyutic), and Oxyrhynchite. Sahidic Coptic was spoken between the cities of Asyut and Oxyrhynchus and flourished as a literary language across Egypt in the period c. 325 – c. 800 AD. The Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi library are primarily written in the Sahidic dialect. However, some texts also contain elements of the Subakhmimic (Lycopolitan) dialect, which was also used in Upper Egypt. Bohairic, the dialect of Lower Egypt, gained prominence in the 9th century and is the dialect used by the Coptic Church liturgically.
