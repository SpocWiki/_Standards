> **Palaeography** (UK) or paleography (US) 
> (ultimately from Ancient Greek: παλαιός, palaiós, 'old', and γράφειν, gráphein, 'to write') 
> is the study and academic discipline of historical writing systems. 
> 
> It encompasses the historicity of manuscripts and texts, 
> subsuming deciphering and dating of historical manuscripts, 
> as well as the analysis of historic penmanship, handwriting script, signification, and printed media. 
> 
> It is primarily concerned with the forms, processes, 
> and relationships of writing and printing systems 
> as evident in a text, document, or manuscript; 
> and analysis of the substantive textual content of documents is a secondary function. 
> 
> Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating manuscripts, 
> and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which texts such as manuscripts, books, codices, tracts, and monographs were produced, and the history of scriptoria. This discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating historical texts. However, in the absence of additional evidence, it cannot be used to pinpoint exact dates.
>
> The discipline is one of the auxiliary sciences of history, 
> and is considered to have been founded by Jean Mabillon with his 1681 work 
> De re diplomatica, the first textbook to address the subject. 
> 
> The term palaeography was coined by Bernard de Montfaucon 
> with the publication of his work on Greek palaeography, the Palaeographia Graeca, in 1708.
