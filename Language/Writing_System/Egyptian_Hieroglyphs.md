> Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs ( HY-roh-glifs) 
> were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt for writing the Egyptian language. 
> Hieroglyphs combined ideographic, logographic, syllabic and alphabetic elements, 
> with more than 1,000 distinct characters. 
> 
> Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious literature on papyrus and wood. 
> The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, 
> as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. 
> 
> Egyptian hieroglyphs are the ultimate ancestor of the Phoenician alphabet, 
> the first widely adopted phonetic writing system. 
> Moreover, owing in large part to the Greek and Aramaic scripts that descended from Phoenician, 
> the majority of the world's living writing systems are descendants of Egyptian hieroglyphs—
> most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts through Greek, 
> and the Arabic and Brahmic scripts through Aramaic.
>
> The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age 
> c. the 33rd century BC (Naqada III), 
> with the first decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the 28th century BC (Second Dynasty). 
> 
> Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system 
> used for monumental inscription in the classical language of the Middle Kingdom period; 
> during this period, the system used about 900 distinct signs. 
> The use of this writing system continued through the New Kingdom and Late Period, 
> and on into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods. 
> 
> Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the Roman period, extending into the 4th century AD.
>
> During the 5th century, the permanent closing of pagan temples across Roman Egypt 
> ultimately resulted in the loss of fluent readers and writers in hieroglyphs. 
> 
> Despite attempts at decipherment, 
> the nature of the script remained unknown throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period. 
> The decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was finally accomplished in the 1820s 
> by Jean-François Champollion, with the help of the Rosetta Stone.
>
> The entire Ancient Egyptian corpus, including both hieroglyphic and hieratic texts, 
> is approximately 5 million words in length; 
> if counting duplicates (such as the Book of the Dead and the Coffin Texts) as separate, 
> this figure is closer to 10 million. 
> 
> The most complete compendium of Ancient Egyptian, 
> the Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache, contains 1.5–1.7 million words.
