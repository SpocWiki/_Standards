> **Cuneiform** is a logo-syllabic writing system that was used to write several languages of the ancient Near East. 
> The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era. 
> Cuneiform scripts are marked by and named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) 
> which form their signs. 
> Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system 
> and was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq).
>
> Over the course of its history, cuneiform was 
> adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian. 
> Akkadian names appear in early Sumerian records 
> and fully Akkadian texts are attested from the 25th century BC onward 
> and make up the bulk of the cuneiform record, mostly from the Akkadian Empire, Assyria and Babylonia. 
> Akkadian cuneiform was itself adapted to write the Hittite language in the early 2nd millennium BC. 
> The other languages with significant cuneiform corpora are Eblaite, Elamite, 
> Hurrian, Luwian, Ugaritic, Aramaic, Dilmunite, some Canaanite  languages and Urartian. 
> 
> The Old Persian and Ugaritic alphabets feature cuneiform-style signs; 
> however, they are unrelated to the cuneiform logo-syllabary proper. 
> The latest known cuneiform tablet, an astronomical almanac written in East Aramaic from Uruk, dates to AD 79/80.
>
> Cuneiform was rediscovered in modern times in the early 17th century 
> with the publication of the trilingual Achaemenid royal inscriptions at Persepolis; 
> these were first deciphered in the early 19th century. 
> 
> The modern study of cuneiform belongs to the ambiguously named field of Assyriology, 
> as the earliest excavations of cuneiform libraries during the mid-19th century 
> were in the area of ancient Assyria. 
> 
> An estimated half a million tablets are held in museums across the world, 
> but comparatively few of these are published. 
> The largest collections belong to the British Museum (approximately 130,000 tablets), 
> the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin, the Louvre, the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, the National Museum of Iraq, the Yale Babylonian Collection (approximately 40,000 tablets), and the Penn Museum.
