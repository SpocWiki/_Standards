## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Rosetta Stone is a stele of granodiorite 
> inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in 196 BC 
> during the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes. 
> 
> The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian 
> using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts, respectively, 
> while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. 
> 
> The decree has only minor differences across the three versions, 
> making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts.
>
> The stone was carved during the Hellenistic period 
> and is believed to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at Sais. 
> 
> It was probably moved in late antiquity or during the Mamluk period, 
> and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien 
> near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. 
> 
> It was found there in July 1799 by French army officer Pierre-François Bouchard 
> during France's invasion of Egypt. 
> 
> It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, 
> and it aroused widespread public interest 
> with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic script. 
> 
> Lithographic copies and plaster casts soon began 
> circulating among European museums and scholars. 
> 
> When the British defeated the French, 
> they took the stone to London under the terms of the Capitulation of Alexandria in 1801. 
> Since 1802, it has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously 
> and it is the most visited object there.
>
> Study of the decree was already underway 
> when the first complete translation of the Greek text was published in 1803. 
> Jean-François Champollion announced the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts in Paris 
> in 1822; it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidently. 
> 
> Major advances in the decoding were recognition 
> that the stone offered three versions of the same text (1799); 
> that the Demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names (1802); 
> that the hieroglyphic text did so as well, and had pervasive similarities to the Demotic (1814); 
> and that phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words (1822–1824).
>
> Three other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, 
> and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, 
> including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: 
> - the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, 
> - the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and 
> - the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, c. 218 BC. 
> 
> Though the Rosetta Stone is now known not to be unique, 
> it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. 
> 
> The term "Rosetta Stone" is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.
