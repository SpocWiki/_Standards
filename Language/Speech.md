## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Speech** is the use of the human voice as a medium for language. 
> Spoken language combines  vowel and consonant sounds 
> to form units of meaning like words, which belong to a language's lexicon. 
> 
> There are many different intentional speech acts, such as informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing; 
> acts may vary in various aspects like enunciation, intonation, loudness, and tempo to convey meaning. 
> Individuals may also unintentionally communicate aspects of their social position through speech, 
> such as sex, age, place of origin, physiological and mental condition, education, and experiences.
>
> While normally used to facilitate communication with others, 
> people may also use speech without the intent to communicate. 
> 
> Speech may nevertheless express emotions or desires; 
> people talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists 
> (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use of silent speech in an interior monologue 
> to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona 
> as self addressing self as though addressing another person.  
> Solo speech can be used to memorize or to test one's memorization of things, 
> and in prayer or in meditation.
>
> Researchers study many different aspects of speech:  speech production and speech perception of the sounds used in a language, speech repetition, speech errors, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in children's enlargement of their vocabulary, and what different areas of the human brain, such as Broca's area and Wernicke's area, underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for  linguistics, cognitive science, communication studies, psychology, computer science, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and acoustics. Speech compares with written language, which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called diglossia.
>
> The evolutionary origin of speech is subject to debate and speculation. While animals also communicate using vocalizations, and trained apes such as Washoe and Kanzi can use simple sign language, no animals' vocalizations are articulated phonemically and syntactically, and do not constitute speech.
