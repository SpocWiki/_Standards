#is_/same_as :: [[../WikiData/WD~Sign_language,34228|WD~Sign_language,34228]] 

there are ca. 300 Sign Languages with additional Dialects. 
The most common one is ASL (American Sign Language)

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Sign Language**s (also known as signed languages) are languages 
> that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning, instead of spoken words. 
> 
> Sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination with non-manual markers. 
> 
> Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. 
> Sign languages are __not universal__ and are usually __not mutually intelligible__, 
> although there are similarities among different sign languages.
>
> Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of natural language, 
> meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process 
> and evolved over time without meticulous planning. 
> 
> This is supported by the fact that there is substantial overlap 
> between the neural substrates of sign and spoken language processing, 
> despite the obvious differences in modality.
>
> Sign language should not be confused with 
> body language, a type of nonverbal communication. 
> 
> Linguists also distinguish natural sign languages 
> from other systems that are precursors to them or obtained from them, 
> such as constructed manual codes for 
> spoken languages, home sign, "baby sign", and signs learned by non-human primates.
>
> Wherever communities of people with hearing challenges or people who experience deafness exist, 
> sign languages have developed as useful means of communication and form the core of local deaf cultures. 
> Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and hard of hearing, it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, 
> those who have trouble with oral language due to a disability or condition (augmentative and alternative communication), 
> and those with deaf family members including children of deaf adults.
>
> The number of sign languages worldwide is not precisely known. __Each country generally has its own native sign language__; some have more than one. 
> The 2021 edition of Ethnologue lists 150 sign languages, while the SIGN-HUB Atlas of Sign Language Structures lists over 200 
> and notes that there are more that have not been documented or discovered yet. 
> As of 2021, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the most-used sign language in the world, 
> and Ethnologue ranks it as the 151st most "spoken" language in the world.
>
> Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition.
