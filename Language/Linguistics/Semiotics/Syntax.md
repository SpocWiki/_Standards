> In linguistics, **Syntax** (SIN-taks) is the study of how words and morphemes combine 
> to form larger units such as phrases and sentences. 
> 
> Central concerns of syntax include word order, grammatical relations, 
> hierarchical sentence structure (constituency), agreement, the nature of crosslinguistic variation, and the relationship between form and meaning (semantics). 
> 
> Diverse approaches, such as generative grammar and functional grammar, 
> offer unique perspectives on syntax, 
> reflecting its complexity and centrality to understanding human language.
