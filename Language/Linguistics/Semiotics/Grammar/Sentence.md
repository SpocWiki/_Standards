> In linguistics and grammar, a sentence is a linguistic expression, 
> such as the English example "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." 
> 
> In traditional grammar, 
> it is typically defined as a string of words that expresses a complete thought, 
> or as a unit consisting of a subject and predicate. 
> 
> In non-functional linguistics 
> it is typically defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a constituent. 
> 
> In functional linguistics, 
> it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features 
> such as upper-case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. 
> 
> This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as 
> pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; 
> and with a clause, 
> which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.
>
> A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully 
> to express a statement, question, exclamation, request, command, or suggestion.
