# [[Pronoun]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In linguistics and grammar, a **Pronoun** (glossed PRO) is a word or a group of words 
> that one may substitute for a noun or noun phrase.
>
> Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, 
> but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, 
> in view of the variety of functions they perform cross-linguistically. 
> 
> An example of a pronoun is "you", which can be either singular or plural. 
> Sub-types include personal and possessive pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative and interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.
>
> The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, 
> where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. 
> For example, in the sentence That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat, 
> the meaning of the pronoun he is dependent on its antecedent, that poor man.
>
> The adjective form of the word "pronoun" is "pronominal". 
> A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. 
> For example, in That's not the one I wanted, the phrase the one (containing the prop-word one) is a pronominal.
