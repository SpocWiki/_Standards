> Comparative linguistics is a branch of historical linguistics 
> that is concerned with comparing languages to establish their historical relatedness.
>
> Genetic relatedness implies a common origin or proto-language 
> and comparative linguistics aims to construct language families, 
> to reconstruct proto-languages 
> and specify the changes that have resulted in the documented languages. 
> 
> To maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms, 
> comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts. 
> 
> A number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed, 
> ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing. 
> Such methods have gone through a long process of development.
