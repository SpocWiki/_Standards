> **Pronunciation** is the way in which a word or a language is spoken.
>
> This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used 
> in speaking a given word or all language in a specific dialect—"correct" or "standard" pronunciation—
> or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language. 
>
> Words' pronunciations can be found in reference works such as dictionaries. 
> General-purpose dictionaries typically only include standard pronunciations, 
> but regional or dialectal pronunciations may be found in more specific works. 
> Orthoepy is the study of the pronunciation of a language.
>
> A word can be spoken in different ways by various individuals or groups, 
> depending on many factors, such as: 
> the duration of the cultural exposure of their childhood, the location of their current residence, speech or voice disorders, their ethnic group, their social class, or their education.
