> A **Backronym** treats an already existing word as an acronym 
> and expands its letters into the words of a phrase, and so is effectively an [[Acrostic]]. 
> 
> The word is a [[Portmanteau]] of back and acronym. 
> Backronyms may be invented with either serious or humorous intent, 
> or they may be a type of false etymology or folk etymology.
>
> A normal acronym is a word derived from the initial letter(s) of the words of a phrase, 
> such as radar from "radio detection and ranging". 
> 
> By contrast, a backronym is "an acronym deliberately 
> formed from a phrase whose initial letters spell out a particular word or words, 
> either to create a memorable name or as a fanciful explanation of a word's origin". 
> 
> Many fictional espionage organizations are backronyms, 
> such as SPECTRE (special executive for counterintelligence, terrorism, revenge and extortion) from the James Bond franchise.
>
> For example, the Amber alert missing-child program was named after Amber Hagerman, 
> a nine-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in 1996. 
> Officials later publicized the backronym "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response".
>
> Backronyms are not to be confused with contrived [[Acronym]]s, 
> where an acronym for a desired word is created prospectively, rather than retrospectively as it is with backronyms.
