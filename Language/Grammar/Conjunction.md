> In grammar, a **Conjunction** (abbreviated CONJ or CNJ) 
> is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses, which are called its conjuncts. 
> 
> That description is vague enough to overlap with those of other parts of speech 
> because what constitutes a "conjunction" must be defined for each language. 
> 
> In English, a given word may have several senses 
> and in some contexts be a preposition but a conjunction in others, depending on the syntax. 
> For example, after is a preposition in "he left after the fight" but a conjunction in "he left after they fought". 
>
> In general, a conjunction is an invariant (non-inflecting) grammatical particle that stands between conjuncts. 
> A conjunction may be placed at the beginning of a sentence, 
> but some superstition about the practice persists. 
> 
> The definition may be extended to idiomatic phrases that behave as a unit 
> and perform the same function, e.g. "as well as", "provided that".
>
> A simple literary example of a conjunction is "the truth of nature, and the power of giving interest" 
> (Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Biographia Literaria).
