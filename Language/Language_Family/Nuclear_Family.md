## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A nuclear family (also known as an elementary family, atomic family, or conjugal family) 
> is a term for a family group consisting of two parents and their children (one or more), 
> typically living in one home residence. 
> 
> It is in contrast to a single-parent family, a larger extended family, 
> or a family with more than two parents. 
> 
> Nuclear families typically center on a married couple that may have any number of children. 
> There are differences in definition among observers. 
> Some definitions allow only biological children who are full-blood siblings, 
> some consider adopted or half- and step-siblings a part of the immediate family, 
> but others allow for a step-parent and any mix of dependent children, 
> including stepchildren and adopted children. 
>
> Some sociologists and anthropologists consider the extended family structure 
> to be the most common family structure in most cultures 
> and at most times for humans, rather than the nuclear family.
>
> The term nuclear family was popularized in the 20th century. 
> Since that time, the number of North American nuclear families is gradually decreasing, 
> while the number of alternative family formations has increased.
