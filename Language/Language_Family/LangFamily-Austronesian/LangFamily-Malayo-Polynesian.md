> The **Malayo-Polynesian** languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages, 
> with approximately 385.5 million speakers. 
> 
>Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the Austronesian peoples outside of Taiwan, 
>in the island nations of Southeast Asia (Indonesia and the Philippine Archipelago) 
>and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia 
>in the areas near the Malay Peninsula, with Cambodia, Vietnam 
>and the Chinese island Hainan as the northwest geographic outlier. 
>
>Malagasy, spoken on the island of Madagascar 
>off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, is the furthest western outlier.
>
> Many languages of the Malayo-Polynesian family in insular Southeast Asia 
> show the strong influence of Sanskrit, Tamil and Arabic, 
> as the western part of the region has been a stronghold of Hinduism, Buddhism, and, later, Islam.
>
> Two morphological characteristics of the Malayo-Polynesian languages are 
> a system of affixation and reduplication (repetition of all or part of a word, such as wiki-wiki) 
> to form new words. 
> 
> Like other Austronesian languages, they have small phonemic inventories; 
> thus a text has few but frequent sounds. 
> 
> The majority also lack consonant clusters. 
> Most also have only a small set of vowels, five being a common number.
