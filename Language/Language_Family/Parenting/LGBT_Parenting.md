## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Same-sex parenting is parenting of children by same-sex couples 
> generally consisting of gay,  lesbian, or bisexual people who are often in civil partnerships, 
> domestic partnerships, civil unions, or same-sex marriages.
>
> Opponents of same-sex parenting argue that it has an adverse impact on children. 
> However, scientific research consistently shows that lesbian and gay parents 
> are as capable and fit as heterosexual parents 
> and that children reared by lesbian and gay parents are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted 
> as those reared by heterosexual parents. 
> 
> Major professional associations of physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, pediatricians, therapists, and social workers have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise.
