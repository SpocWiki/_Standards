## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Uto-Aztecan** languages, also known as the Uto-Aztekan or Uto-Nahuatl languages, 
> are a family of Native American languages, consisting of over thirty languages. 
> 
> Uto-Aztecan languages are found almost entirely in the Western United States and Mexico. 
> The name of the language family reflects the **common ancestry** of the Ute language of Utah 
> and the Nahuan languages (also known as Aztecan) of Mexico.
>
> The Uto-Aztecan language family is one of the largest linguistic families in the Americas 
> in terms of number of speakers, number of languages, and geographic extension. 
> 
> The northernmost Uto-Aztecan language is Shoshoni, which is spoken as far north as Salmon, Idaho, 
> while the southernmost is the Nawat language of El Salvador and Nicaragua. 
> Ethnologue gives the total number of languages in the family as 61, 
> and the total number of speakers as 1,900,412. 
> Speakers of Nahuatl languages account for over 85% of these.
>
> The internal classification of the family often divides it into two branches: 
> a northern branch including all the languages of the US 
> and a southern branch including all the languages of Mexico, 
> although it is still being discussed whether this is best understood as a genetic classification 
> or as a geographical one. 
> 
> Below this level of classification the main branches are well accepted: 
> - Numic (including languages such as Comanche and Shoshoni) 
> - and the Californian languages (formerly known as the Takic group, including Cahuilla and Luiseño) account for most of the Northern languages. 
> - Hopi and Tübatulabal are languages outside those groups. 
> The Southern languages are divided into 
> - the Tepiman languages (including Oʼodham and Tepehuán), 
> - the Tarahumaran languages (including Raramuri and Guarijio), 
> - the Cahitan languages (including Yaqui and Mayo), 
> - the Coracholan languages (including Cora and Huichol), 
> - and the Nahuan languages.
>
> The homeland of the Uto-Aztecan languages is generally considered to have 
> been in the Southwestern United States or possibly Northwestern Mexico. 
> 
> An alternative theory has proposed the possibility that the language family 
> originated in southern Mexico, within the Mesoamerican language area, 
> but this has not been generally considered convincing.
