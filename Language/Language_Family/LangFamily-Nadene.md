> **Na-Dene** ( NAH-dih-NAY; also Nadene, Na-Dené, Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit, Tlina–Dene) 
> is a family of Native American languages that includes at least the Athabaskan languages, 
> Eyak, and Tlingit languages. 
> 
> Haida was formerly included but is now generally considered a language isolate. 
> By far the most widely spoken Na-Dene language today is Navajo, 
> also the most spoken indigenous language north of Mexico.
>
> Some linguists have proposed that the Na-Dene family 
> is related to the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia, creating a Dene–Yeniseian family. 
> However, this proposal has not been accepted by some linguists.
