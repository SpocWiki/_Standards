## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Aramaic (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: ארמית, romanized: ˀərāmiṯ; Classical Syriac: ܐܪܡܐܝܬ, romanized: arāmāˀiṯ) is a Northwest Semitic language 
> that originated in the ancient region of Syria and quickly spread to Mesopotamia, 
> the southern Levant, Sinai, southeastern Anatolia, the Caucasus, and Eastern Arabia, 
> where it has been continually written and spoken in different varieties for over 3,000 years.
>
> Aramaic served as a language of public life and administration of ancient kingdoms and empires—
> particularly the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Neo-Babylonian Empire, and Achaemenid Empire—
> and as a language of divine worship and religious study within Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism. 
> 
> Several modern varieties of Aramaic are still spoken. 
> The modern eastern branch is spoken by Assyrians, Mandeans, and Mizrahi Jews. 
> 
> Western Aramaic is still spoken by the Muslim and Christian Arameans (Syriacs) in the towns of Maaloula, Bakh'a and Jubb'adin in Syria. 
> 
> Classical varieties are used as liturgical and literary languages in several West Asian churches, 
> as well as in Judaism, Samaritanism, and Mandaeism. 
> 
> The Aramaic language is considered endangered, 
> with several varieties used mainly by the older generations. 
> 
> Researchers are working to record and analyze 
> all of the remaining varieties of Neo-Aramaic languages in case they become extinct.
>
> Aramaic belongs to the Northwest group of the Semitic language family, 
> which includes the mutually intelligible Canaanite languages such as 
> Hebrew, Edomite, Moabite, Ekronite, Sutean, and Phoenician, as well as Amorite and Ugaritic. 
> 
> Aramaic varieties are written in the Aramaic alphabet, 
> a descendant of the Phoenician alphabet. 
> 
> The most prominent variant of this alphabet is the Syriac alphabet, used in the ancient city of Edessa. 
> 
> The Aramaic alphabet became a base for the creation and adaptation of 
> specific writing systems in some other Semitic languages of West Asia, 
> such as the Hebrew alphabet and the Arabic alphabet.
>
> Early Aramaic inscriptions date from the 11th century BC, 
> placing it among the earliest languages to be written down. 
> 
> Aramaicist Holger Gzella notes, "The linguistic history of Aramaic 
> prior to the appearance of the first textual sources in the 9th century BC remains unknown." 
> 
> Aramaic is believed by most historians and scholars to have been 
> the primary language spoken by Jesus of Nazareth both for preaching and in everyday life.
