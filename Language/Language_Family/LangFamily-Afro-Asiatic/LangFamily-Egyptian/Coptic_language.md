> Coptic (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, romanized: Timetremənkʰēmi) is a dormant Afroasiatic language. 
> It is a group of closely related Egyptian dialects, 
> representing the most recent developments of the Egyptian language, 
> and historically spoken by the Copts, starting from the third century AD in Roman Egypt. 
> Coptic was supplanted by Arabic as the primary spoken language of Egypt 
> following the Arab conquest of Egypt and was slowly replaced over the centuries.
>
> Coptic has no modern-day native speakers, and no fluent speakers apart from a number of priests, 
> although it remains in daily use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church 
> and of the Coptic Catholic Church. 
> It is written with the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet 
> with seven additional letters borrowed from the Demotic Egyptian script.
>
> The major Coptic dialects are Sahidic, Bohairic, Akhmimic, Fayyumic, Lycopolitan (Asyutic), and Oxyrhynchite. 
> Sahidic Coptic was spoken between the cities of Asyut and Oxyrhynchus 
> and flourished as a literary language across Egypt in the period c. 325 – c. 800 AD. 
> 
> The Gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi library are primarily written in the Sahidic dialect. 
> However, some texts also contain elements of the Subakhmimic (Lycopolitan) dialect, 
> which was also used in Upper Egypt. 
> 
> Bohairic, the dialect of Lower Egypt, gained prominence in the 9th century 
> and is the dialect used by the Coptic Church liturgically.
