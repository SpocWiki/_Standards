## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Goths** were a Germanic people who played a major role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire 
> and the emergence of medieval Europe. 
> They were first reported by Graeco-Roman authors in the 3rd century AD, 
> living north of the Danube in what is now Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania. 
> From here they conducted raids into Roman territory, 
> and large numbers of them joined the Roman military. 
> These early Goths lived in the regions where archaeologists find the Chernyakhov culture, 
> which flourished throughout this region during the 3rd and 4th centuries.
>
> In the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths in present-day Ukraine 
> were overwhelmed by a significant westward movement of Alans and Huns from the east. 
> Large numbers of Goths subsequently concentrated upon the Roman border at the Lower Danube, 
> seeking refuge inside the Roman Empire. 
> 
> After they entered the Empire, violence broke out, and Goth-led forces 
> inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. 
> 
> Roman forces regained a level of control but many Goths and other eastern peoples 
> were quickly settled in and near the empire. 
> One group of these, initially led by their king Alaric I, sacked the city of Rome in 410 
> and were the precursors of the Visigoths, 
> and their successors eventually established a Visigothic Kingdom in Spain at Toledo. 
> Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, 
> most importantly the Ostrogoths. 
> Under their king Theodoric the Great, these Goths 
> established an Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy at Ravenna.
>
> The Ostrogothic Kingdom was destroyed by the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century, 
> while the Visigothic Kingdom was largely conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate in the  8th century, 
> with a remnant in Asturias which would go on to initiate the Reconquista under Pelagius. 
> 
> Remnants of Gothic communities in Crimea, known as the Crimean Goths, 
> established a culture that survived for more than a thousand years, 
> although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.
>
> Gothic architecture, Gothic literature and the modern-day Goth subculture 
> ultimately derive their names from the ancient Goths, 
> though the Goths themselves did not directly create or influence these art forms.
