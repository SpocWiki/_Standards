## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Germanic languages** are a branch of the Indo-European language family 
> spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people 
> mainly in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Southern Africa. 
> 
> The most widely spoken Germanic language, English, 
> is also the world's most widely spoken language with an estimated 2 billion speakers. 
> All Germanic languages are derived from Proto-Germanic, spoken in Iron Age Scandinavia, 
> Iron Age Northern Germany and along the North Sea and Baltic coasts.
>
> The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages: 
> - English with around 360–400 million native speakers; 
> - German, with over 100 million native speakers; and 
> - Dutch, with 24 million native speakers. 
> 
> Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans, 
> an offshoot of Dutch originating from the Afrikaners of South Africa, with over 7.1 million native speakers; 
> 
> Low German, considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects, 
> with roughly 4.35–7.15 million native speakers and probably 6.7–10 million people who can understand it  (at least 2.2 million in Germany (2016) and 2.15 million in the Netherlands (2003));  
> 
> Yiddish, once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe, 
> now with approximately 1.5 million native speakers; 
> Scots, with 1.5 million native speakers; 
> Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch–Belgian–German border; 
> and the Frisian languages with over 500,000 native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany.
>
> The largest North Germanic languages are Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian, 
> which are in part mutually intelligible and have a combined total of 
> about 20 million native speakers in the Nordic countries 
> and an additional five million second language speakers; 
> since the Middle Ages, however, these languages have been strongly influenced by Middle Low German, 
> a West Germanic language, and Low German words account for about 30–60% of their vocabularies according to various estimates. 
> 
> Other extant North Germanic languages are Faroese, Icelandic, and Elfdalian, 
> which are more conservative languages with no significant Low German influence, 
> more complex grammar and limited mutual intelligibility with other North Germanic languages today.
>
> The East Germanic branch included Gothic, Burgundian, and Vandalic, all of which are now extinct. 
> The last to die off was Crimean Gothic, spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of Crimea.
>
> The SIL Ethnologue lists 48 different living Germanic languages, 
> 41 of which belong to the Western branch and six to the Northern branch; 
> it places Riograndenser Hunsrückisch German in neither of the categories, 
> but it is often considered a German dialect by linguists. 
> 
> The total number of Germanic languages throughout history is unknown as some of them, 
> especially the East Germanic languages, disappeared during or after the Migration Period. 
> 
> Some of the West Germanic languages also did not survive past the Migration Period, including Lombardic. 
> As a result of World War II and subsequent mass expulsion of Germans, 
> the German language suffered a significant loss of Sprachraum, 
> as well as moribundity and extinction of several of its dialects. 
> In the 21st century, German dialects are dying out as Standard German gains primacy.
>
> The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called Proto-Germanic, 
> also known as Common Germanic, 
> which was spoken in about the middle of the 1st millennium BC in Iron Age Scandinavia. 
> 
> Proto-Germanic, along with all of its descendants, notably has a number of unique linguistic features, 
> most famously the consonant change known as "Grimm's law." 
> 
> Early varieties of Germanic entered history when the Germanic tribes moved south from Scandinavia 
> in the 2nd century BC to settle in the area of today's northern Germany and southern Denmark.
