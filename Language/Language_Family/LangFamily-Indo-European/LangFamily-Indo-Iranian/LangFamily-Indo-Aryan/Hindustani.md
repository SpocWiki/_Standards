> Hindustani is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in North India and Pakistan 
> as the lingua franca of the region. 
> It is also spoken by the Deccani-speaking community in the Deccan plateau. 
> Hindustani is a pluricentric language with two standard registers, known as 
> - Hindi (Sanskritised register written in the Devanagari script) and 
> - Urdu (Persianised and Arabised register written in the Perso-Arabic script) 
> which serve as official languages of India and Pakistan, respectively. 
> 
> Thus, it is also called Hindi–Urdu. 
> Colloquial registers of the language fall on a spectrum between these standards. 
> In modern times, a third variety of Hindustani with significant English influences 
> has also appeared, which is sometimes called Hinglish or Urdish.
>
> The concept of a **Hindustani language** as a "unifying language" or "fusion language" 
> that could transcend communal and religious divisions across the subcontinent 
> was endorsed by Mahatma Gandhi, as it was not seen to be associated with 
> either the Hindu or Muslim communities as was the case with Hindi and Urdu respectively, 
> and it was also considered a simpler language for people to learn. 
> The conversion from Hindi to Urdu (or vice versa) is generally achieved 
> by merely transliterating between the two scripts. 
> Translation, on the other hand, is generally only required for religious and literary texts.
>
> Scholars trace the language's first written poetry, in the form of Old Hindi, 
> to the Delhi Sultanate era around the twelfth and thirteenth century. 
> During the period of the Delhi Sultanate, which covered most of today's India, 
> eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal and Bangladesh 
> and which resulted in the contact of Hindu and Muslim cultures, 
> the Sanskrit and Prakrit base of Old Hindi became enriched with loanwords from Persian, 
> evolving into the present form of Hindustani. 
> 
> The Hindustani vernacular became an expression of Indian national unity 
> during the Indian Independence movement, 
> and continues to be spoken as the common language 
> of the people of the northern Indian subcontinent, 
> which is reflected in the Hindustani vocabulary of Bollywood films and songs.
>
> The language's core vocabulary is derived from Prakrit and Classical Sanskrit (both descended from Vedic Sanskrit), with substantial loanwords from Persian and Arabic (via Persian). It is often written in the Devanagari script or the Arabic-derived Urdu script in the case of Hindi and Urdu respectively, with romanisation increasingly employed in modern times as a neutral script.
>
> As of 2025, Hindi and Urdu together constitute the 3rd-most-spoken language in the world after English and Mandarin, with 855 million native and second-language speakers, according to Ethnologue, though this includes millions who self-reported their language as 'Hindi' on the Indian census but speak a number of other Hindi languages than Hindustani. The total number of Hindi–Urdu speakers was reported to be over 300 million in 1995, making Hindustani the third- or fourth-most spoken language in the world.
