## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Pama–Nyungan** languages ( PAH-mə-NYOONG-ən) 
> are the most widespread family of Australian Aboriginal languages, 
> comprising 306 of the 400 Aboriginal languages of Australia. 
> 
> The name "Pama–Nyungan" is a merism: it is derived from the two end-points of the range, 
> - the Pama languages of northeast Australia (where the word for 'man' is pama) and 
> - the Nyungan languages of southwest Australia (where the word for 'man' is nyunga).
>
> The other language families indigenous to the continent of Australia are often referred to, 
> by exclusion, as non-Pama–Nyungan languages, though this is not a taxonomic term. 
> 
> The Pama–Nyungan family accounts for most of the geographic spread, 
> most of the Aboriginal population, and the greatest number of languages. 
> 
> Most of the Pama–Nyungan languages are spoken by small ethnic groups of hundreds of speakers or fewer. Many languages have become extinct, and almost all remaining ones are endangered in some way. Only in the central inland portions of the continent do Pama–Nyungan languages continue to be spoken vigorously by the entire community.
>
> The first descriptions of languages from this family were found in missionary grammars from the early 19th century, but the Pama–Nyungan family itself was identified and named only by Kenneth L. Hale in his work on the classification of Native Australian languages.  Hale's research led him to the conclusion that of the Aboriginal Australian languages, one relatively closely interrelated family had spread and proliferated over most of the continent, while approximately a dozen other families were concentrated along the North coast.
