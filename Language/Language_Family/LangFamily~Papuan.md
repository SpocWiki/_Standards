## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Papuan languages** are the non-Austronesian languages 
> spoken on the western Pacific island of New Guinea, 
> as well as neighbouring islands in Eastern Indonesia, Solomon Islands, and East Timor. 
> It is a strictly geographical grouping, and does not imply a genetic relationship.
>
> New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse region in the world. 
> Besides the Austronesian languages, there arguably are some 800 languages 
> divided into perhaps sixty small language families, 
> with unclear relationships to each other or to any other languages, 
> plus many language isolates. 
> 
> The majority of the Papuan languages are spoken on the island of New Guinea, 
> with a number spoken in the Bismarck Archipelago, Bougainville Island 
> and the Solomon Islands (for example, Lavukaleve to the east, and in Halmahera, Timor and the Alor archipelago to the west. The westernmost language, Tambora in Sumbawa, is extinct. One Papuan language, Meriam, is spoken within the national borders of Australia, in the eastern Torres Strait. 
>
> Several languages of Flores, Sumba, and other islands of eastern Indonesia 
> are classified as Austronesian but have large numbers of non-Austronesian words in their basic vocabulary and non-Austronesian grammatical features. 
> 
> It has been suggested that these may have originally been non-Austronesian languages 
> that have borrowed nearly all of their vocabulary from neighboring Austronesian languages, 
> but no connection with the Papuan languages of Timor has been found. 
> 
> In general, the Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages are marked by a significant historical Papuan influence, lexically, grammatically, and phonologically, and this is responsible for much of the diversity of the Austronesian language family.
