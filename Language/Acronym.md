> An **acronym** is an abbreviation formed using the initial letters of a multi-word name or phrase. 
> Acronyms are often spelled with the initial letter of each word in all caps with no punctuation.
>
> In English the word is used in two ways. 
> 
> In the narrow sense, an acronym is a sequence of letters (representing the initial letters of words in a phrase) when pronounced together as a single word; for example, NASA, NATO, or laser. 
> 
> In the broad sense, the term includes this kind of sequence when pronounced letter by letter (such as GDP or USA). 
> 
> Sources that differentiate the two often call the former acronyms and the latter initialisms or alphabetisms. 
> 
> However, acronym is popularly used to refer to either concept, and both senses of the term are attributed as far back as the 1940s. 
> Dictionary and style-guide editors dispute whether the term acronym can be legitimately 
> applied to abbreviations which are not pronounced as words, 
> and there is no general agreement on standard acronym spacing, casing, and punctuation.
>
> The phrase that the acronym stands for is called its expansion. 
> The meaning of an acronym includes both its expansion and the meaning of its expansion.
