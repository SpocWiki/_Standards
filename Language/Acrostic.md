## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Acrostic** is a poem or other word composition 
> in which the first letter (or syllable, or word) of each new line 
> (or paragraph, or other recurring feature in the text) 
> spells out a word, message or the alphabet. 
> 
> The term comes from the French acrostiche from post-classical Latin acrostichis, 
> from Koine Greek ἀκροστιχίς, from Ancient Greek ἄκρος "highest, topmost" and στίχος "verse". 
> 
> As a form of constrained writing, an acrostic can be used as a [[Mnemonic_Device]] to aid memory retrieval.  
> When the last letter of each new line (or other recurring feature) forms a word it is called a telestich (or telestic); 
> the combination of an acrostic and a telestich in the same composition is called a double acrostic 
> (e.g. the first-century Latin [[Sator_Square]]).
>
> Acrostics are common in medieval literature, 
> where they usually serve to highlight the name of the poet or his patron, or to make a prayer to a saint. 
> 
> They are most frequent in verse works but can also appear in prose. 
> The Middle High German poet Rudolf von Ems for example opens all his great works with an acrostic of his name, 
> and his world chronicle marks the beginning of each age with an acrostic of the key figure (Moses, David, etc.). 
> 
> In chronicles, acrostics are common in German and English but rare in other languages.
