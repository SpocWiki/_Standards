> **Etymology** ( ET-im-OL-ə-jee) is the study of the origin and evolution of words—
> including their constituent units of sound and meaning—across time. 
> 
> In the 21st century a subfield within linguistics, 
> etymology has become a more rigorously scientific study. 
> 
> Most directly tied to historical linguistics, philology, and semiotics, 
> it additionally draws upon comparative semantics, morphology, pragmatics, 
> and phonetics in order to attempt a comprehensive 
> and chronological catalogue of all meanings and changes that a word (and its related parts) 
> carries throughout its history. The origin of any particular word is also known as its etymology.
>
> For languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts, particularly texts about the language itself, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in many European languages, for example, can be traced back to the origin of the Indo-European language family.
>
> Even though etymological research originated from the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done on language families where little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian.
