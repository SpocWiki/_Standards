> In astronomy, dark matter is an invisible and hypothetical form of matter 
> that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. 
> 
> Dark matter is implied by gravitational effects that cannot be explained by general relativity 
> unless more matter is present than can be observed. 
> Such effects occur in the context of formation and evolution of galaxies, gravitational lensing, 
> the observable universe's current structure, mass position in galactic collisions, 
> the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. 
> Dark matter is thought to serve as gravitational scaffolding for cosmic structures.
>
> After the Big Bang, dark matter clumped into blobs along narrow filaments 
> with superclusters of galaxies forming a cosmic web 
> at scales on which entire galaxies appear like tiny particles.
>
> In the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the mass–energy content of the universe is 
> - 5% ordinary matter, 
> - 26.8% dark matter, and 
> - 68.2% a form of energy known as dark energy. 
> 
> Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total mass, 
> while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass–energy content. 
> 
> While the density of dark matter is significant in the halo around a galaxy, 
> its local density in the Solar System is much less than normal matter. 
> The total of all the dark matter out to the orbit of Neptune 
> would add up about 1017 kg, the same as a large asteroid.
>
> Dark matter is not known to interact with ordinary baryonic matter and radiation except through gravity, 
> making it difficult to detect in the laboratory. 
> The most prevalent explanation is that dark matter is some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particle, 
> such as either weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions. 
> The other main possibility is that dark matter is composed of primordial black holes.
>
> Dark matter is classified as "cold", "warm", or "hot" 
> according to velocity (more precisely, its free streaming length). 
> Recent models have favored a cold dark matter scenario, 
> in which structures emerge by the gradual accumulation of particles.
>
> Although the astrophysics community generally accepts the existence of dark matter, 
> a minority of astrophysicists, intrigued by specific observations that are not well explained 
> by ordinary dark matter, argue for various modifications of the standard laws of general relativity. 
> 
> These include modified Newtonian dynamics, tensor–vector–scalar gravity, or entropic gravity. 
> So far none of the proposed modified gravity theories can describe every piece of observational evidence at the same time, 
> suggesting that even if gravity has to be modified, some form of dark matter will still be required.
