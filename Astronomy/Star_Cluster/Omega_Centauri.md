> Omega Centauri (ω Cen, NGC 5139, or Caldwell 80) 
> is a globular cluster in the constellation of Centaurus 
> that was first identified as a non-stellar object by Edmond Halley in 1677. 
> 
> Located at a distance of 17,090 light-years (5,240 parsecs), 
> it is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years. 
> It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, 
> with a total mass of 4 million solar masses, 
> making it the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way.
>
> Omega Centauri is very different from most other galactic globular clusters 
> to the extent that it is thought to have originated as 
> the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. 
> 
> There is evidence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the dense core of this cluster, 
> although this is disputed.
