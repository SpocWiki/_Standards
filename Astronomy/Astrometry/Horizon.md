> The **Horizon** is the border between the surface of a celestial body 
> and its sky when viewed from the perspective of an observer 
> on or above the surface of the celestial body. 
> This concept is further refined as 
> - The true or geometric horizon, which an observer would see 
>   if there was no alteration from refraction or obstruction by intervening objects. 
>   The geometric horizon assumes a spherical earth. 
>   The true horizon takes into account the fact that the earth is an irregular ellipsoid. 
>   When refraction is minimal, 
>   the visible sea or ocean horizon is the closest an observer can get to seeing the true horizon.
>
> - The refracted or apparent horizon, which is the true horizon viewed through atmospheric refraction. 
>   Refraction can make distant objects seem higher or, less often, lower than they actually are. 
>   An unusually large refraction may cause a distant object to appear ("loom") 
>   above the refracted horizon or disappear ("sink") below it.
>
> - The visible horizon, which is the refracted horizon obscured by terrain, 
>   and on Earth it can also be obscured by life forms such as trees 
>   and/or human constructs such as buildings.
>
> - There is also an imaginary astronomical, celestial, or theoretical horizon, 
>   part of the horizontal coordinate system, which is an infinite eye-level plane 
>   perpendicular to a line that runs (a) from the center of a celestial body (b) 
>   through the observer and (c) out to space (see graphic). 
>   It is used to calculate "horizon dip," which is the difference between the astronomical horizon 
>   and the sea horizon measured in arcs. 
>   Horizon dip is one factor taken into account in navigation by the stars.
>
> In perspective drawing, the horizon line (also referred to as "eye-level") 
> is the point of view from which the drawn scene is presented. 
> It is an imaginary vertical line across the scene. 
> 
> The line may be above, level with, or below the center of the drawing, 
> corresponding to looking down, straight at, or up to the drawn scene. 
> Vanishing lines run from the foreground to one or more vanishing points on the horizon line.
