> **Heliocentrism** (also known as the heliocentric model) 
> is a superseded astronomical model in which 
> Earth and planets orbit around the Sun at the center of the universe. 
> 
> Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, 
> which placed Earth at the center. The notion that Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, who had been influenced by a concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 – 385 BC). In the 5th century BC the Greek philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas had the thought on different occasions that Earth was spherical and revolving around a "mystical" central fire, and that this fire regulated the universe. In medieval Europe, however, Aristarchus' heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic period.
>
> It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric, Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution.  In 1576, Thomas Digges published a modified Copernican system. His modifications are close to modern observations. In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.
>
> With the observations of William Herschel, Friedrich Bessel, and other astronomers, it was realized that the Sun, while near the barycenter of the Solar System, was not central in the universe. Modern astronomy does not distinguish any universal center. After these discoveries, informal language still holds to the remaining truth value of the term, narrowed to the scope of our planetary system.
