> The Orion Nebula (also known as Messier 42, M42, or NGC 1976) is a diffuse nebula in the Milky Way 
> situated south of Orion's Belt in the constellation of Orion, 
> and is known as the middle "star" in the "sword" of Orion. 
> 
> It is one of the brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky 
> with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. 
> It is 1,344 ± 20 light-years (412.1 ± 6.1 pc) away 
> and is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. 
> 
> M42 is estimated to be 25 light-years across 
> (so its apparent size from Earth is approximately 1 degree). 
> It has a mass of about 2,000 times that of the Sun. 
> Older texts frequently refer to the Orion Nebula as the Great Nebula in Orion 
> or the Great Orion Nebula.
>
> The Orion Nebula is one of the most scrutinized and photographed objects in the night sky 
> and is among the most intensely studied celestial features. 
> 
> The nebula has revealed much about the process of how stars and planetary systems are formed 
> from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. 
> 
> Astronomers have directly observed protoplanetary disks and brown dwarfs within the nebula, 
> intense and turbulent motions of the gas, 
> and the photo-ionizing effects of massive nearby stars in the nebula.
