> A molecular cloud—sometimes called a stellar nursery if star formation is occurring within—
> is a type of interstellar cloud of which the density and size permit absorption nebulae, 
> the formation of molecules (most commonly molecular hydrogen, H2), 
> and the formation of H II regions. 
> 
> This is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium 
> that contain predominantly ionized gas.
>
> Molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio observations, 
> so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of H2 is carbon monoxide (CO). 
> The ratio between CO luminosity and H2 mass is thought to be constant, 
> although there are reasons to doubt this assumption in observations of some other galaxies.
>
> Within molecular clouds are regions with higher density, 
> where much dust and many gas cores reside, called clumps. 
> 
> These clumps are the beginning of star formation 
> if gravitational forces are sufficient to cause the dust and gas to collapse.
