> A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud, particularly molecular clouds, 
> that is so dense that it obscures the visible wavelengths of light from objects behind it, 
> such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. 
> 
> The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains 
> in the coldest, densest parts of molecular clouds. 
> 
> Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. 
> Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. 
> 
> Like other interstellar dust or material, the things it obscures 
> are visible only using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.
>
> Dark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, 
> coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, 
> which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. 
> 
> Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O (CO with oxygen as the 18O isotope), 
> CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) 
> and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. 
>
> The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries 
> and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. 
> 
> The closest and largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, 
> since they are the least obscured by stars in between Earth and the nebula, 
> and because they have the largest angular size, 
> appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way 
> like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great Rift. 
> These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.
>
> In the inner molecular regions of dark nebulae, events such as the formation of stars and masers take place.
