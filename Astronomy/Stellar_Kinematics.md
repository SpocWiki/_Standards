> In astronomy, stellar kinematics

> Stellar kinematics encompasses the measurement of

> Measurement of the kinematics of stars in different subcomponents of the Milky Way 
> including the thin disk, the thick disk, the bulge, 
> and the stellar halo provides important information 
> about the formation and evolutionary history of our Galaxy.

> Kinematic measurements can also identify exotic phenomena 
> such as hypervelocity stars escaping from the Milky Way, 
> which are interpreted as the result of gravitational encounters of binary stars

> Stellar kinematics is related to but distinct from the subject of stellar dynamics, 
> which involves the theoretical study or modeling of the motions of stars under the influence of gravity. Stellar-dynamical models of systems such as galaxies or star clusters are often compared with or tested against stellar-kinematic data to study their evolutionary history and mass distributions, and to detect the presence of dark matter or supermassive black holes through their gravitational influence on stellar orbits.
