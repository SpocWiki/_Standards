> In astronomy, coordinate systems are used for specifying positions of celestial objects 
> (satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, etc.) relative to a given reference frame, 
> based on physical reference points available to a situated observer 
> (e.g. the true horizon and north to an observer on Earth's surface). 
> 
> Coordinate systems in astronomy can specify an object's relative position in three-dimensional space 
> or plot merely by its direction on a celestial sphere, if the object's distance is unknown or trivial.
>
> Spherical coordinates, projected on the celestial sphere, 
> are analogous to the geographic coordinate system used on the surface of Earth. 
> 
> These differ in their choice of fundamental plane, 
> which divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. 
> 
> Rectangular coordinates, in appropriate units, have the same fundamental (x, y) plane 
> and primary (x-axis) direction, such as an axis of rotation. 
> Each coordinate system is named after its choice of fundamental plane.
