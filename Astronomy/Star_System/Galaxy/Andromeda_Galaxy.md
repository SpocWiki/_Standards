# [[Andromeda_Galaxy]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. 
> It was originally named the Andromeda Nebula and is cataloged as Messier 31, M31, and NGC 224. 
> Andromeda has a D25 isophotal diameter of about 46.56 kiloparsecs (152,000 light-years) 
> and is approximately 765 kpc (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. 
> 
> The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, 
> the constellation of Andromeda, 
> which itself is named after the princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.
>
> The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is the same order of magnitude as the Milky Way, 
> at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). 
> 
> The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, 
> but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy was more massive than the Milky Way 
> by a margin of some 25% to 50%. 
> 
> However, this has been called into question by early-21st-century studies 
> indicating a possibly lower mass for the Andromeda Galaxy and a higher mass for the Milky Way. 
> The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 46.56 kpc (152,000 ly), 
> making it the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies in terms of extension.
>
> The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies have about a 50% chance of 
> colliding with each other in the next 10 billion years, 
> merging to potentially form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.
>
> With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, 
> the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects, 
> and is visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless nights, 
> even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.
