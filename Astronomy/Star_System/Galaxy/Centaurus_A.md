> Centaurus A (also known as NGC 5128 or Caldwell 77) is a galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. 
> It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop 
> from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. 
> 
> There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental properties 
> such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) 
> and distance (11–13 million light-years). 
> 
> It is the closest radio galaxy to Earth, as well as the closest BL Lac object, 
> so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. 
> The galaxy is also the fifth-brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target. 
> It is only visible from the southern hemisphere and low northern latitudes.
>
> The center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 55 million solar masses, 
> which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths.  
> By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, 
> astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet 
> are moving at about half of the speed of light. 
> X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases, 
> resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles. 
> The X-ray jets of Centaurus A are thousands of light-years long, 
> while the radio jets are over a million light-years long.
>
> It is also one of the nearest large starburst galaxies, 
> of which a galactic collision is suspected to be responsible for an intense burst of star formation. 
> 
> Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy 
> that collided with a smaller spiral galaxy, with which it will eventually merge. 
> For that reason, the galaxy has been of particular interest to astronomers for years. 
> 
> While collisions of spiral galaxies are relatively common, 
> the effects of a collision between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy are not fully understood.
