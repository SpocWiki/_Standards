## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, 
> along with quasar host galaxies. 
> 
> They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation 
> that are outside of our own galaxy) with very high surface brightnesses 
> whose spectra reveal strong, high-ionisation emission lines, 
> but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable.
>
> Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies 
> and are some of the most intensely studied objects in astronomy, 
> as they are thought to be powered by the same phenomena that occur in quasars, 
> although they are closer and less luminous than quasars. 
> 
> These galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers 
> which are surrounded by accretion discs of in-falling material. 
> The accretion discs are believed to be the source of the observed ultraviolet radiation. 
> 
> Ultraviolet emission and absorption lines provide the best diagnostics 
> for the composition of the surrounding material.
>
> Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, 
> but when studied under other wavelengths, it becomes clear that 
> the luminosity of their cores is of comparable intensity 
> to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.
>
> Seyfert galaxies are named after Carl Seyfert, who first described this class in 1943.
