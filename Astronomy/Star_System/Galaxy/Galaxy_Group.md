> A galaxy group or group of galaxies (GrG) is an aggregation of galaxies 
> comprising about 50 or fewer gravitationally bound members, 
> each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (about 10^10 times the luminosity of the Sun); 
> collections of galaxies larger than groups that are first-order clustering are called galaxy clusters. 
> 
> The groups and clusters of galaxies can themselves be clustered, into superclusters of galaxies.
>
> The Milky Way galaxy is part of a group of galaxies called the Local Group.
