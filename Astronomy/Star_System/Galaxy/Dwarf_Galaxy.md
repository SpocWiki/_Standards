> A dwarf galaxy is a small galaxy composed of about 1000 up to several billion stars, 
> as compared to the Milky Way's 200–400 billion stars. 
> 
> The Large Magellanic Cloud, which closely orbits the Milky Way and contains over 30 billion stars, 
> is sometimes classified as a dwarf galaxy; others consider it a full-fledged galaxy. 
> 
> Dwarf galaxies' formation and activity are thought 
> to be heavily influenced by interactions with larger galaxies. 
> 
> Astronomers identify numerous types of dwarf galaxies, based on their shape and composition.
