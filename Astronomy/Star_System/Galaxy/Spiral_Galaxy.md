## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Spiral galaxies form a class of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble 
> in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae 
> and, as such, form part of the Hubble sequence. 
> 
> Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating disk containing stars, gas and dust, 
> and a central concentration of stars known as the bulge. 
> 
> These are often surrounded by a much fainter halo of stars, 
> many of which reside in globular clusters.
>
> Spiral galaxies are named by their spiral structures 
> that extend from the center into the galactic disk. 
> 
> The spiral arms are sites of ongoing star formation and are brighter than the surrounding disc 
> because of the young, hot OB stars that inhabit them.
>
> Roughly two-thirds of all spirals are observed to 
> have an additional component in the form of a bar-like structure, 
> extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. 
> 
> The proportion of barred spirals relative to barless spirals 
> has likely changed over the history of the universe, with 
> only about 10% containing bars about 8 billion years ago, 
> to roughly a quarter 2.5 billion years ago, until 
> present, where over two-thirds of the galaxies in the visible universe (Hubble volume) have bars.
>
> The Milky Way is a barred spiral, 
> although the bar itself is difficult to observe from Earth's current position within the galactic disc. 
> The most convincing evidence for the stars forming a bar in the Galactic Center 
> comes from several recent surveys, including the Spitzer Space Telescope.
>
> Together with irregular galaxies, 
> spiral galaxies make up approximately 60% of galaxies in today's universe. 
> They are mostly found in low-density regions and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters.
