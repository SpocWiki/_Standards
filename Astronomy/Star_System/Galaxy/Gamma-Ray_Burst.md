> In gamma-ray astronomy, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 
> are extremely energetic events occurring in distant galaxies 
> which represent the brightest and most powerful class of explosion in the universe. 
> 
> These extreme electromagnetic emissions are second only to the Big Bang 
> as the most energetic and luminous phenomenon ever known. 
> 
> Gamma-ray bursts can last from a few milliseconds to several hours. 
> After the initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived afterglow is emitted, 
> usually in the longer wavelengths of X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave or radio frequencies.
>
> The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is thought to be released during a supernova 
> or superluminous supernova as a high-mass star implodes 
> to form a neutron star or a black hole. 
> Short-duration (sGRB) events are a subclass of GRB signals 
> that are now known to originate from the cataclysmic merger of binary neutron stars.
>
> The sources of most GRB are billions of light years away from Earth, 
> implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic 
> (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds 
> as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) 
> and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). 
> 
> All GRBs in recorded history have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy, 
> although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeaters, 
> are associated with magnetars within our galaxy. 
> 
> A gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way pointed directly at Earth 
> would likely sterilize the planet or effect a mass extinction. 
> The Late Ordovician mass extinction has been hypothesised by some researchers 
> to have occurred as a result of such a gamma-ray burst.
>
> GRB signals were first detected in 1967 by the Vela satellites, 
> which were designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests; 
> after an "exhaustive" period of analysis, this was published as academic research in 1973. 
> 
> Following their discovery, 
> hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, 
> such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. 
> 
> Little information was available to verify these models 
> until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows 
> and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, 
> and thus their distances and energy outputs. 
> 
> These discoveries—and subsequent studies of the galaxies 
> and supernovae associated with the bursts—clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, 
> definitively placing them in distant galaxies.
