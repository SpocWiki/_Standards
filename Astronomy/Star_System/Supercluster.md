## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Supercluster** is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups; 
> they are among the **largest known structures in the universe**. 
> 
> The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy group (which contains more than 54 galaxies), 
> which in turn is part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is part of the Laniakea Supercluster, 
> which is part of the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex. 
> 
> The large size and low density of superclusters means 
> that most of them, unlike clusters, expand with the Hubble expansion. 
> 
> The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.
