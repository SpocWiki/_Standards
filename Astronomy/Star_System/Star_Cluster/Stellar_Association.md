> A stellar association is a very loose star cluster, 
> looser than both open clusters and globular clusters. 
> 
> Stellar associations will normally contain from 10 to 100 or more visible stars. 
> 
> An association is primarily identified by 
> commonalities in its member stars' movement vectors, ages, and chemical compositions. 
> These shared features indicate that the members share a common origin. 
> 
> Nevertheless, they have become gravitationally unbound, unlike star clusters, 
> and the member stars will drift apart over millions of years, 
> becoming a moving group as they scatter throughout their neighborhood within the galaxy.
>
> Stellar associations were discovered by Victor Ambartsumian in 1947. 
> The conventional name for an association uses the names or abbreviations of the constellation (or constellations) in which they are located; the association type, and, sometimes, a numerical identifier.
