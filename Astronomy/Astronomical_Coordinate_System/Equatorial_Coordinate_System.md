> The equatorial coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system 
> widely used to specify the positions of celestial objects. 
> 
> It may be implemented in spherical or rectangular coordinates, both defined by 
> - an origin at the centre of Earth, 
> - a fundamental plane consisting of the projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere 
>   (forming the celestial equator), 
> - a fixed primary direction towards the March equinox, and 
> - a right-handed convention.
>
> The origin at the centre of Earth means the coordinates are geocentric, 
> that is, as seen from the centre of Earth as if it were transparent. 
> 
> The fundamental plane and the fixed primary direction mean that the coordinate system, 
> while aligned with Earth's equator and pole, **does not rotate with the Earth**, 
> but remains relatively fixed against the background stars. 
> 
> A right-handed convention means that coordinates increase northward from 
> and eastward around the fundamental plane.
