# [[Cepheid_Variable]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[../../WikiData/WD~Cepheid_variable,188593|WD~Cepheid_variable,188593]] 

The name derives from the fact that most Stars in the [[../Star~Constellation/Zodiac~Cepheus|Zodiac~Cepheus]] are Cepheids. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A Cepheid variable is a type of variable star that pulsates radially, 
> varying in both diameter and temperature. 
> 
> It changes in brightness, with a well-defined stable period (typically 1–100 days) and amplitude. 
> Cepheids are important cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances; 
> a strong direct relationship exists between a Cepheid variable's luminosity and its pulsation period.
>
> This characteristic of classical Cepheids was discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt 
> after studying thousands of variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds. 
> The discovery establishes the true luminosity of a Cepheid by observing its pulsation period. 
> This in turn gives the distance to the star 
> by comparing its known luminosity to its observed brightness, 
> calibrated by directly observing the parallax distance to the closest Cepheids 
> such as RS Puppis and Polaris.
>
> Cepheids change brightness due to the κ–mechanism, 
> which occurs when opacity in a star increases with temperature rather than decreasing. 
> 
> The main gas involved is thought to be helium. 
> The cycle is driven by the fact doubly ionized helium, the form adopted at high temperatures, 
> is more opaque than singly ionized helium. 
> 
> As a result, the outer layer of the star cycles between being compressed, 
> which heats the helium until it becomes doubly ionized 
> and (due to opacity) absorbs enough heat to expand; 
> which cools the helium until it becomes singly ionized 
> and (due to transparency) cools and collapses again. 
> 
> Cepheid variables become dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized.
