> Mīrzā Muhammad Tarāghāy bin Shāhrukh 
> (Chagatay: میرزا محمد تراغای بن شاهرخ; Persian: میرزا محمد طارق بن شاهرخ), 
> better known as Ulugh Beg (Persian: الغ‌بیک; 22 March 1394 – 27 October 1449), 
> was a Timurid sultan, as well as an astronomer and mathematician.  
>
> Ulugh Beg was notable for his work in astronomy-related mathematics, 
> such as trigonometry and spherical geometry, 
> as well as his general interests in the arts and intellectual activities. 
> 
> It is thought that he spoke five languages: 
> Arabic, Persian, Chaghatai Turkic, Mongolian, and a small amount of Chinese. 
> 
> During his rule (first as a governor, then outright) 
> the Timurid Empire achieved the cultural peak of the Timurid Renaissance 
> through his attention and patronage. 
> Samarkand was captured and given to Ulugh Beg by his father Shah Rukh.
>
> He built the great Ulugh Beg Observatory in Samarkand between 1424 and 1429. 
> It was considered by scholars to have been 
> one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time 
> and the largest in Central Asia. 
> 
> Ulugh Beg was subsequently recognized as 
> the most important observational astronomer from the 15th century by many scholars. 
> He also built the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417–1420) in Samarkand and Bukhara, 
> transforming the cities into cultural centers of learning in Central Asia.
>
> However, Ulugh Beg's scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance. 
> During his short reign, he failed to establish his power and authority. 
> As a result, other rulers, including his family, took advantage of his lack of control, 
> and he was subsequently overthrown and assassinated.
