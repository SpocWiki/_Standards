> Edmond (or Edmund) Halley  (; 8 November [O.S. 29 October] 1656 – 25 January 1742 [O.S. 14 January 1741]) 
> was an English astronomer, mathematician and physicist. 
> He was the second Astronomer Royal in Britain, succeeding John Flamsteed in 1720.
>
> From an observatory he constructed on Saint Helena in 1676–77, 
> Halley catalogued the southern celestial hemisphere and recorded a transit of Mercury across the Sun. 
> 
> He realised that a similar transit of Venus could be used to 
> determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun. 
> Upon his return to England, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society, 
> and with the help of King Charles II, was granted a master's degree from Oxford.
>
> Halley encouraged and helped fund 
> the publication of Isaac Newton's influential Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687). 
> From observations Halley made in September 1682, he used Newton's law of universal gravitation 
> to compute the periodicity of Halley's Comet in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets. 
> It was named after him upon its predicted return in 1758, which he did not live to see.
>
> Beginning in 1698, Halley made sailing expeditions and made observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism. 
> In 1718, he discovered the proper motion of the "fixed" stars.
