> Ceres (minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is a dwarf planet 
> in the middle main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 
> 
> It was the first known asteroid, discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi 
> at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily, and announced as a new planet. 
> 
> Ceres was later classified as an asteroid and then a dwarf planet, 
> the only one not beyond Neptune's orbit.
>
> Ceres's diameter is about a quarter that of the Moon. 
> Its small size means that even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye, 
> except under extremely dark skies. 
> 
> Its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, 
> peaking at opposition (when it is closest to Earth) once every 15- to 16-month synodic period. 
> 
> As a result, its surface features are barely visible even with the most powerful telescopes, 
> and little was known about it 
> until the robotic NASA spacecraft Dawn approached Ceres for its orbital mission in 2015.
>
> Dawn found Ceres's surface to be a mixture of water, ice, and hydrated minerals 
> such as carbonates and clay. 
> Gravity data suggest Ceres to be 
> partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less dense, but stronger crust 
> that is at most thirty percent ice by volume. 
> 
> Although Ceres likely lacks an internal ocean of liquid water, 
> brines still flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface, 
> allowing cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons to form roughly every fifty million years. 
> 
> This makes Ceres the closest known cryovolcanically active body to the Sun. 
> Ceres has an extremely tenuous and transient atmosphere of water vapour, 
> vented from localised sources on its surface.
