> Cosmic dust – also called extraterrestrial dust, space dust, or star dust – 
> is dust that occurs in outer space or has fallen onto Earth. 
> 
> Most cosmic dust particles measure between a few molecules and 0.1 mm (100 μm), 
> such as micrometeoroids (<30 μm) and meteoroids (>30 μm). 
> 
> Cosmic dust can be further distinguished by its astronomical location: 
> - intergalactic dust, 
> - interstellar dust, 
> - interplanetary dust (as in the zodiacal cloud), and 
> - circumplanetary dust (as in a planetary ring). 
> There are several methods to obtain space dust measurement.
>
> In the Solar System, interplanetary dust causes the zodiacal light. 
> Solar System dust includes comet dust, planetary dust (like from Mars), asteroidal dust, dust from the Kuiper belt, and interstellar dust passing through the Solar System. 
> Thousands of tons of cosmic dust are estimated to reach Earth's surface every year, 
> with most grains having a mass between 1e−16 kg (0.1 pg) and 1e−4 kg (0.1 g).  
> The density of the dust cloud through which the Earth is traveling is approximately 10−6 dust grains/m3.
>
> Cosmic dust contains some complex organic compounds (amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic–aliphatic structure) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars.  
> A smaller fraction of dust in space is "stardust" consisting of larger refractory minerals 
> that condensed as matter left by stars.
>
> Interstellar dust particles were collected by the Stardust spacecraft 
> and samples were returned to Earth in 2006.
