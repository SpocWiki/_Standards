> Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune. 
> 
> It is the only moon of Neptune massive enough to be rounded under its own gravity 
> and hosts a thin, hazy atmosphere. 
> 
> Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde orbit—
> revolving in the opposite direction to the parent planet's rotation—
> the only large moon in the Solar System to do so. 
> 
> Triton is thought to have once been a dwarf planet from the Kuiper belt, 
> captured into Neptune's orbit by the latter's gravity.
>
> At 2,710 kilometers (1,680 mi) in diameter, Triton is the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System, 
> the second-largest planetary moon in relation to its primary (after Earth's Moon), 
> and larger than all of the known dwarf planets. 
> 
> The mean density is 2.061 g/cm3, reflecting a composition of approximately 
> 30–45% water ice by mass, with the rest being mostly rock and metal. 
> 
> Triton is differentiated, with a crust of primarily ice 
> atop a probable subsurface ocean of liquid water and a solid rocky-metallic core at its center. 
> 
> Although Triton's orbit is nearly circular with a very low orbital eccentricity of 0.000016, 
> its interior may still experience tidal heating through obliquity tides.
>
> Triton is one of the most geologically active worlds in the Solar System, 
> with an estimated average surface age of less than 100 million years old. 
> 
> Its surface is covered by frozen nitrogen and is geologically young, with very few impact craters. 
> Young, intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains suggest a complex geological history. 
> 
> The atmosphere of Triton is composed primarily of nitrogen, 
> with minor components of methane and carbon monoxide. 
> Triton's atmosphere is relatively thin and strongly variable, 
> with its atmospheric surface pressure varying by up to a factor of three within the past 30 years. 
> Triton's atmosphere supports clouds of nitrogen ice crystals and a layer of organic atmospheric haze. 
>
> Triton was the first Neptunian moon to be discovered, on October 10, 1846, 
> by English astronomer William Lassell. 
> 
> The 1989 flyby of Triton by the Voyager 2 spacecraft 
> remains the only up-close visit to the moon as of 2025. 
> 
> As the probe was able to study only about 40% of the moon's surface, 
> multiple concept missions have been developed to revisit Triton. 
> 
> These include a Discovery-class Trident 
> and New Frontiers-class Triton Ocean Worlds Surveyor and Nautilus.
