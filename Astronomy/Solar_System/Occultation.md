> An **Occultation** is an event that occurs when 
> one object is hidden from the observer by another object that passes between them. 
> 
> The term is often used in astronomy, but can also refer to any situation in which 
> an object in the foreground blocks from view (occults) an object in the background. 
> 
> In this general sense, occultation applies to the visual scene observed from low-flying aircraft 
> (or computer-generated imagery) 
> when foreground objects obscure distant objects dynamically, as the scene changes over time.
>
> If the closer body does not entirely conceal the farther one, the event is called a transit. 
> Both transit and occultation may be referred to generally as occlusion; 
> and if a shadow is cast onto the observer, it is called an eclipse.
