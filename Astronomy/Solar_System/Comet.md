> A **Comet** is an icy, small Solar System body 
> that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the Sun, a process called outgassing. 
> 
> This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the nucleus, 
> and sometimes a tail of gas and dust gas blown out from the coma. 
> 
> These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation 
> and the outstreaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comet. 
> Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across 
> and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. 
> 
> The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. 
> If sufficiently close and bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope 
> and can subtend an arc of up to 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. 
> Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.
>
> Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital periods, 
> ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. 
> Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, 
> which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. 
> 
> Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, 
> a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. 
> Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun 
> by gravitational perturbations from passing stars and the galactic tide. 
> 
> Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. 
> The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.
>
> Extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust 
> and may come to resemble small asteroids. 
> 
> Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, 
> having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. 
> 
> However, the discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets 
> has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets. 
> 
> In the early 21st century, the discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, 
> but characteristics of inner solar system asteroids, were called Manx comets. 
> They are still classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). 
> Twenty-seven Manx comets were found from 2013 to 2017.
>
> As of November 2021, there are 4,584 known comets. 
> However, this represents a very small fraction of the total potential comet population, 
> as the reservoir of comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System (in the Oort cloud) is about one trillion. 
> 
> Roughly one comet per year is visible to the naked eye, though many of those are faint and unspectacular. 
> Particularly bright examples are called "great comets". 
> Comets have been visited by uncrewed probes such as NASA's Deep Impact, 
> which blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior, 
> and the European Space Agency's Rosetta, which became the first to land a robotic spacecraft on a comet.
