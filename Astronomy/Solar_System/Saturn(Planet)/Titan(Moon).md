> Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. 
> 
> It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere—denser than Earth's—
> and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth 
> with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. 
> 
> Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. 
> Frequently described as a planet-like moon, 
> Titan is 50% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. 
> 
> It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; 
> yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock 
> while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.
>
> Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, 
> Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite 
> (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). 
> 
> Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km above Saturn's apparent surface. 
> 
> From Titan's surface, Saturn, disregarding its rings, subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, 
> and when viewed from above its thick atmospheric haze it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, 
> in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48° of arc.
>
> Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, with a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, 
> including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water. 
> 
> Much as with Venus before the Space Age, 
> the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface 
> until the Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004 provided new information, 
> including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions 
> and the discovery of its atmospheric super-rotation. 
> 
> The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, 
> although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.
>
> The atmosphere of Titan is mainly nitrogen and methane; 
> minor components lead to the formation of hydrocarbon clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. 
> 
> Its climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, 
> such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, 
> and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. 
> 
> With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, 
> Titan's methane cycle nearly resembles Earth's water cycle, 
> albeit at a much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179 °C; −290 °F). 
> 
> Due to these factors, Titan is sometimes called the most Earth-like celestial object in the Solar System.
