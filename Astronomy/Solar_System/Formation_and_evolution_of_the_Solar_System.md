> There is evidence that the formation of the Solar System began about 4.6 billion years ago 
> with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. 
> Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, 
> while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk 
> out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.
>
> This model, known as the nebular hypothesis, was first developed in the 18th century 
> by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. 
> 
> Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines 
> including astronomy, chemistry, geology, physics, and planetary science. 
> Since the dawn of the Space Age in the 1950s and the discovery of exoplanets in the 1990s, 
> the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.
>
> The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. 
> Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, 
> while other moons are thought to have formed independently 
> and later to have been captured by their planets. 
> 
> Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. 
> Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day 
> and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. 
> 
> Beyond Neptune, many sub-planet sized objects formed. 
> Several thousand trans-Neptunian objects have been observed. 
> Unlike the planets, these trans-Neptunian objects mostly move on eccentric orbits, 
> inclined to the plane of the planets. 
> The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions. 
> The process of planetary migration explains parts of the Solar System's current structure.
>
> In roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter, 
> becoming a red giant, before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula 
> and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. 
> 
> In the distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. 
> Some planets will be destroyed, and others ejected into interstellar space. 
> Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, 
> it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.
