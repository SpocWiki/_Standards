> Orbital elements are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit. 
> In celestial mechanics these elements are considered in two-body systems using a Kepler orbit. 
> There are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, 
> but certain schemes are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics.
>
> A real orbit and its elements change over time due to gravitational perturbations by other objects 
> and the effects of general relativity. 
> A Kepler orbit is an idealized, mathematical approximation of the orbit at a particular time.
>
> When viewed from an inertial frame, two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories. 
> Each of these trajectories has its focus at the common center of mass. 
> 
> When viewed from a non-inertial frame centered on one of the bodies, 
> only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent; 
> Keplerian elements describe these non-inertial trajectories. 
> 
> An orbit has two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which body is used as the point of reference. 
> The reference body (usually the most massive) is called the primary, the other body is called the secondary. 
> The primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary, 
> and even when the bodies are of equal mass, the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary.
>
> Orbital elements can be obtained from orbital state vectors 
> (position and velocity vectors along with time and magnitude of acceleration) 
> by manual transformations or with computer software through a process known as orbit determination.
>
> Non-closed orbits exist, although these are typically referred to as trajectories and not orbits, 
> as they are not periodic. 
> The same elements used to describe closed orbits can also typically be used to represent open trajectories.
