> Charon ( KAIR-on, -⁠ən or  SHARR-ən), formal designation (134340) Pluto I, 
> is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. 
> It has a mean radius of 606 km (377 mi). 
> 
> Charon is the sixth-largest known trans-Neptunian object 
> after Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Gonggong. 
> It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., 
> using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).
>
> With half the diameter and one-eighth the mass of Pluto, 
> Charon is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body. 
> Its gravitational influence is such that the barycenter of the Plutonian system lies outside Pluto, 
> and the two bodies are tidally locked to each other. 
> The dwarf planet systems Pluto–Charon and Eris–Dysnomia 
> are the only known examples of mutual tidal locking in the Solar System, 
> though it is likely that Orcus–Vanth is another.
>
> The reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, 
> organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients of life.  
> These tholins were produced from methane, nitrogen, and related gases 
> which may have been released by cryovolcanic eruptions on the moon, 
> or may have been transferred over 19,000 km (12,000 mi) 
> from the atmosphere of Pluto to the orbiting moon.
>
> The New Horizons spacecraft is the only probe that has visited the Pluto system. 
> It approached Charon to within 27,000 km (17,000 mi) in 2015.
