> The **Ecliptic** or ecliptic plane is the orbital plane of Earth around the Sun. 
> It was a central concept in a number of ancient sciences, 
> providing the framework for key measurements in astronomy, astrology and calendar-making.
>
> From the perspective of an observer on Earth, 
> the Sun's movement around the celestial sphere over the course of a year 
> traces out a path along the ecliptic against the background of stars – specifically the Zodiac constellations. 
> 
> The planets of the Solar System can also be seen along the ecliptic, 
> because their orbital planes are very close to Earth's. 
> The Moon's orbital plane is also similar to Earth's; 
> the ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that **eclipses only occur when the Moon is crossing it**.
>
> The ecliptic is an important reference plane and is the basis of the [[ecliptic coordinate system]]. 
> Ancient scientists were able to calculate Earth's axial tilt by comparing the ecliptic plane to that of the equator.
