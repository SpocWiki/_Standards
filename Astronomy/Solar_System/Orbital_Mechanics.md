> Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics 
> to rockets, satellites, and other spacecraft. 
> 
> The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton's laws of motion 
> and the law of universal gravitation. 
> Astrodynamics is a core discipline within space-mission design and control.
>
> Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity, 
> including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. 
> Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbital plane changes, 
> and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers.
>
> General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, 
> and it is sometimes necessary to use it for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (e.g. orbits near the Sun).
