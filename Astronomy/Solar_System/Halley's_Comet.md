> Halley's Comet is the only known short-period comet 
> that is consistently visible to the naked eye from Earth, appearing every 72–80 years, 
> though with the majority of recorded apparitions (25 of 30) occurring after 75–77 years. 
> 
> It last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061. 
> Officially designated 1P/Halley, it is also commonly called Comet Halley, or sometimes simply Halley. 
>
> Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed 
> and recorded by astronomers around the world since at least 240 BC, 
> but it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond Halley understood 
> that these appearances were re-appearances of the same comet. 
> As a result of this discovery, the comet is named after Halley.
>
> In March 1986, during its latest visit to the inner Solar System, 
> Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by a spacecraft, 
> ESA's Giotto mission, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus 
> and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. 
> 
> These observations supported several longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's "dirty snowball" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices—such as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia—and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy. It was also visited by the two spacecrafts of the Vega program, Vega 1 & 2, on March 6 and March 9, respectively. They went as close as 8,890 km (5,520 mi), and 8,030 km (4,990 mi), providing data on Halley's dimensions, shape, temperature, and surface properties.
