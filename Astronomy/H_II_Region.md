> An H II region is a region of interstellar atomic hydrogen that is ionized. 
> It is typically in a molecular cloud of partially ionized gas 
> in which star formation has recently taken place, 
> with a size ranging from one to hundreds of light years, 
> and density from a few to about a million particles per cubic centimetre. 
> 
> The Orion Nebula, now known to be an H II region, 
> was observed in 1610 by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc by telescope, 
> the first such object discovered.
>
> The regions may be of any shape 
> because the distribution of the stars and gas inside them is irregular. 
> 
> The short-lived blue stars created in these regions emit copious amounts of ultraviolet light 
> that ionize the surrounding gas. 
> 
> H II regions—sometimes several hundred light-years across—
> are often associated with giant molecular clouds. 
> 
> They often appear clumpy and filamentary, 
> sometimes showing intricate shapes such as the Horsehead Nebula. 
> 
> H II regions may give birth to thousands of stars over a period of several million years. 
> Supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from the most massive stars 
> in the resulting star cluster ultimately disperse the remaining gas of the H II region.
>
> H II regions can be observed at considerable distances in the universe, 
> and the study of extragalactic H II regions (Such as NGC 604 and 206) is important 
> in determining the distances and chemical composition of galaxies. 
> 
> Spiral and irregular galaxies contain many H II regions, 
> while elliptical galaxies are almost devoid of them. 
> 
> In spiral galaxies, including our Milky Way, H II regions are concentrated in the spiral arms, 
> while in irregular galaxies they are distributed chaotically. 
> 
> Some galaxies contain huge H II regions, which may contain tens of thousands of stars. 
> Examples include the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud 
> and NGC 604 in the Triangulum Galaxy.
