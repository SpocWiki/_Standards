> An **Atmosphere** (Greek  ἀτμός (atmós) 'vapour, steam' and  σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'sphere') 
> is a layer of gases that envelop an astronomical object, 
> held in place by the gravity of the object. 
> 
> A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great 
> and the temperature of the atmosphere is low. 
> 
> A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, 
> which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; 
> stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules.
>
> The atmosphere of Earth is composed of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (0.9%), carbon dioxide (0.04%) and trace gases. 
> 
> Most organisms use oxygen for respiration; 
> lightning and bacteria perform nitrogen fixation which produces ammonia 
> that is used to make nucleotides and amino acids; 
> plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. 
> 
> The layered composition of the atmosphere minimises the harmful effects of 
> sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, solar wind, and cosmic rays 
> and thus protects the organisms from genetic damage. 
> 
> The current composition of the atmosphere of the Earth is the product 
> of billions of years of biochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.
