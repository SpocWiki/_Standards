## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, published by Johannes Kepler in 1609 
> (except the third law, which was fully published in 1619), 
> describe the orbits of planets around the Sun. 
> 
> These laws replaced circular orbits and epicycles in the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus 
> with elliptical orbits and explained how planetary velocities vary. 
> The three laws state that:
> - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
> - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
> - The square of a planet's orbital period 
>   is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
>
> The elliptical orbits of planets were indicated by calculations of the orbit of Mars. 
> From this, Kepler inferred that other bodies in the Solar System, 
> including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits. 
> 
> The second law establishes that when a planet is closer to the Sun, it travels faster. 
> The third law expresses that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbital period.
>
> Isaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System as a consequence of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation.
>
> A more precise historical approach is found in Astronomia nova, Harmonice Mundi 
> and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae.
