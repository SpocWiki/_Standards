## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In astronomy and planetary science, a **Magnetosphere** is a region of space 
> surrounding an astronomical object, such as a planet or other object, 
> in which charged particles are affected by that object's magnetic field. 
> It is created by a celestial body with an active interior dynamo. 
>
> In the space environment close to a planetary body with a dipole magnetic field such as Earth, 
> the field lines resemble a simple magnetic dipole. 
> 
> Farther out, field lines can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducting plasma, 
> as emitted from the Sun (i.e., the solar wind) or a nearby star. 
> 
> Planets having active magnetospheres, like the Earth, 
> are capable of mitigating or blocking the effects of solar radiation or cosmic radiation. 
> 
> Interactions of particles and atmospheres with magnetospheres 
> are studied under the specialized scientific subjects of plasma physics, space physics, and aeronomy.
