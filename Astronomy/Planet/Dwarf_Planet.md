## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A dwarf planet is a small planetary-mass object that is in direct orbit around the Sun, 
> massive enough to be gravitationally rounded, 
> but insufficient to achieve orbital dominance like the eight classical planets of the Solar System. 
> 
> The prototypical dwarf planet is Pluto, which for decades was regarded as a planet 
> before the "dwarf" concept was adopted in 2006.
>
> Many planetary geologists consider dwarf planets and planetary-mass moons to be planets, 
> but since 2006 the IAU and many astronomers have excluded them from the roster of planets.
>
> Dwarf planets are capable of being geologically active, 
> an expectation that was borne out in 2015 by the Dawn mission to Ceres 
> and the New Horizons mission to Pluto. 
> Planetary geologists are therefore particularly interested in them.
>
> Astronomers are in general agreement that at least the nine largest candidates are dwarf planets â€“ 
> in rough order of decreasing diameter, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna, Ceres, and Orcus. 
> 
> A considerable uncertainty remains over the tenth largest candidate Salacia, 
> which may thus be considered a borderline case. 
> Of these ten, two have been visited by spacecraft (Pluto and Ceres) 
> and seven others have at least one known moon 
> (Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Orcus, and Salacia), 
> which allows their masses and thus an estimate of their densities to be determined. 
> 
> Mass and density in turn can be fit into geophysical models 
> in an attempt to determine the nature of these worlds. 
> 
> Only one, Sedna, has neither been visited nor has any known moons, 
> making an accurate estimate of mass difficult. 
> 
> Some astronomers include many smaller bodies as well, 
> but there is no consensus that these are likely to be dwarf planets.
