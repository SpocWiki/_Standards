> A stellar magnetic field is a magnetic field 
> generated by the motion of conductive plasma inside a star. 
> 
> This motion is created through convection, 
> which is a form of energy transport involving the physical movement of material. 
> 
> A localized magnetic field exerts a force on the plasma, 
> effectively increasing the pressure without a comparable gain in density. 
> 
> As a result, the magnetized region rises relative to the remainder of the plasma, 
> until it reaches the star's photosphere. 
> 
> This creates starspots on the surface, and the related phenomenon of coronal loops.
