> A **Nova** is a transient astronomical event 
> that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star 
> (hence the name "nova", Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months. 
> 
> All observed novae involve white dwarfs in close binary systems, 
> but causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, 
> depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. 
> 
> The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. 
> They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars.
>
> - Classical nova eruptions are the most common type. 
> This type is usually created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf 
> and either a main sequence, subgiant, or red giant star. 
> 
> If the orbital period of the system is a few days or less, 
> the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to draw accreted matter onto its surface, 
> creating a dense but shallow atmosphere. 
> 
> This atmosphere, mostly consisting of hydrogen, is heated by the hot white dwarf 
> and eventually reaches a critical temperature, causing ignition of rapid runaway fusion. 
> 
> The sudden increase in energy expels the atmosphere into interstellar space, 
> creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event. 
> In past centuries such an event was thought to be a new star. 
> A few novae produce short-lived nova remnants, lasting for perhaps several centuries.
>
> A recurrent nova involves the same processes as a classical nova, 
> except that the nova event repeats in cycles of a few decades or less 
> as the companion star again feeds the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf after each ignition, 
> as in the star T Coronae Borealis.
>
> Under certain conditions, mass accretion can eventually trigger runaway fusion 
> that destroys the white dwarf rather than merely expelling its atmosphere. 
> In this case, the event is usually classified as a Type Ia supernova.
>
> Novae most often occur in the sky along the path of the Milky Way, 
> especially near the observed Galactic Center in Sagittarius; 
> however, they can appear anywhere in the sky. 
> 
> They occur far more frequently than galactic supernovae, 
> averaging about ten per year in the Milky Way. 
> 
> Most are found telescopically, perhaps only one every 12â€“18 months reaching naked-eye visibility. 
> Novae reaching first or second magnitude occur only a few times per century. 
> The last bright nova was V1369 Centauri, which reached 3.3 magnitude on 14 December 2013.
