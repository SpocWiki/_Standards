Metallicity Z: about **1.2–1.4% of the Sun’s mass** consists of elements heavier than H and He.

Fe/H is a **logarithmic measure of stellar iron abundance relative to the Sun**. It is widely used as a proxy for overall metallicity because iron produces strong, measurable spectral lines. The formula is:

Fe/H = log⁡10(Fe/H)star−log⁡10(Fe/H)⊙

where Fe and H​ are the number densities of iron and hydrogen, 
and the subscript ⊙ denotes solar values.

High metallicity in Population I stars enhances radiative opacity and stellar winds, 
increasing the probability of white dwarf remnants and Type Ia supernova progenitors. 

Lower metallicity in Population II stars favors neutron star and black hole formation at lower initial mass thresholds. 

Population III stars, due to negligible metal cooling, are predicted to reach very high masses 
and end as pair-instability supernovae or direct-collapse black holes. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In 1944, Walter Baade categorized groups of stars within the Milky Way into stellar populations.
>
> In the abstract of the article by Baade, he recognizes that Jan Oort originally conceived this type of classification in 1926.
>
> Baade observed that bluer stars were strongly associated with the spiral arms, and yellow stars dominated near the central galactic bulge and within globular star clusters. Two main divisions were deemed population I and population II stars, with another newer, hypothetical division called population III added in 1978.
>
> Among the population types, significant differences were found with their individual observed stellar spectra. These were later shown to be very important and were possibly related to star formation, observed kinematics, stellar age, and even galaxy evolution in both spiral and elliptical galaxies. These three simple population classes usefully divided stars by their chemical composition, or metallicity. In astrophysics nomenclature metal refers to all elements heavier than helium, including chemical non-metals such as oxygen.
>
> By definition, each population group shows the trend where lower metal content indicates higher age of stars. Hence, the first stars in the universe (very low metal content) were deemed population III, old stars (low metallicity) as population II, and recent stars (high metallicity) as population I. The Sun is considered population I, a recent star with a relatively high 1.4% metallicity.
