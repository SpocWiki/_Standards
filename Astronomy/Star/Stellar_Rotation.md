> **Stellar rotation** is the angular motion of a star about its axis. 
> The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, 
> or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.
>
> The rotation of a star produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. 
> As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. 
> Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different angular velocity than the higher latitudes. 
> These differences in the rate of rotation within a star 
> may have a significant role in the generation of a stellar magnetic field.
>
> In its turn, the magnetic field of a star interacts with the stellar wind. 
> As the wind moves away from the star its angular speed decreases. 
> 
> The magnetic field of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. 
> 
> As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, 
> and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.
