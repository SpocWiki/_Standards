> In astronomy, the main sequence is a classification of stars 
> which appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness as a continuous and distinctive band. 
> 
> Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars, 
> and positions of stars on and off the band are believed to indicate their physical properties, 
> as well as their progress through several types of star life-cycles. 
> 
> These are the most numerous true stars in the universe and include the Sun. 
> Color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.

## Evolutions 
### Red Giant Evolution for small Stars 
#### A. Core Hydrogen Exhaustion

- In the **main sequence phase**, stars like the Sun fuse **hydrogen (H)** into **helium (He)** via the **proton–proton chain** reaction:
    
    4\,^{1}\!H => ^{4}\!He + 2e^+ + 2\nu_e + \text{energy}
- For the Sun, this phase lasts approximately **10×10⁹ years (10 Gyr)**.
    
- Once most core hydrogen is converted to helium, fusion **ceases in the core** because **helium nuclei require higher temperatures (≥ 100 MK)** to fuse than hydrogen (≈ 15 MK).
    

#### B. Core Contraction and Shell Burning

- With no fusion in the core, **gravitational contraction** begins.
    
- The contraction **increases core temperature (Tₛ ≈ 10⁸ K)** and **density (ρ ≈ 10⁵ kg/m³)**.
    
- Hydrogen fusion resumes in a **thin shell** surrounding the inert helium core.
    
- The energy output of this shell increases total luminosity **by a factor of 100–1000 (10²–10³)**.
    

#### C. Envelope Expansion

- The outer stellar layers **expand** due to the **increased radiation pressure** from the burning shell.
    
- As the star expands, the surface temperature **drops** from **≈ 5800 K** to **≈ 3000 K**, shifting emitted light toward the **red** spectrum (hence “red giant”).
    
- Stellar radius increases from **1 R☉ (≈ 7×10⁵ km)** to **≈ 100–200 R☉ (≈ 7×10⁷–1.4×10⁸ km)**.
    

#### III. Quantitative Summary

| Parameter           | Main Sequence (Sun) | Red Giant Phase               | Change        |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Core Temperature    | 15 MK               | 100 MK                        | +567 %        |
| Luminosity          | 1 L☉                | 100–1000 L☉                   | +9900 %       |

| Density (core)      | 1.5×10⁵ kg/m³       | 10⁶ kg/m³                     | +567 %        |

### IV. Future Evolution

After becoming a red giant, the Sun will:

- Reach the **helium flash** stage, igniting **helium fusion** via the **triple-alpha process**:
    
    3\,^{4}\!He => ^{12}\!C + \gamma
- Spend approximately **100×10⁶ years (0.1 Gyr)** in the **horizontal branch** phase.  


## Supernova Explosion for > 8 M☉  

Heavier stars expand into **red or blue supergiants** 
and progress through successive **fusion stages up to iron**. 

The process ends catastrophically when fuel has exhausted 
and **nuclear fusion can no longer generate energy**. 
The cores collapse under gravity, producing a supernova and leaving behind 
- either a neutron star (≈ 1.4–2.5 M☉) 
- or a black hole (> 2.5 M☉). 

This terminal event also seeds the interstellar medium with heavy elements (Z > 26) — 
the astrophysical origin of most elements beyond iron.

### II. Physical Mechanism of Evolution in Massive Stars

#### A. Main Sequence Phase

- Fusion process: **CNO cycle** dominates over the proton–proton chain.
- Core temperature: **≥ 20 MK–50 MK** (vs. ≈ 15 MK for the Sun).
- Duration: 1000 times shorter — e.g., **a 25 M☉ star lives ≈ 7×10⁶ years (7 Myr)**, compared to **10×10⁹ years (10 Gyr)** for the Sun.
- Luminosity: **10⁴–10⁶ L☉**, scaling approximately as ( $L \propto M^{3.5}$ ).

#### B. Post-Main Sequence: Red Supergiant or Blue Supergiant Phase

- Once hydrogen is exhausted in the core, helium fusion begins via the **triple-alpha process**:  
    $3,^{4}!He => ^{12}!C + \gamma$ 
- As core helium is consumed, the star sequentially fuses heavier elements:  
    H => He => C => O => Ne => Mg => Si => Fe  
- Each fusion stage occurs faster due to increasing temperatures and decreasing available fuel.

| Fusion Stage                   | Dominant Product | Core Temperature |   Duration |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------- | ---------------: | ---------: |
| Hydrogen → Helium              | Helium (He)      |            40 MK |     10 Myr |
| Helium → Carbon/Oxygen         | C, O             |           200 MK |      1 Myr |
| Carbon → Neon/Sodium/Magnesium | Ne, Na, Mg       |           600 MK | 1000 years |
| Neon → Oxygen/Magnesium        | O, Mg            |           1.2 GK |     1 year |
| Oxygen → Silicon/Sulfur        | Si, S            |           1.5 GK |   0.5 year |
| Silicon → Iron-group           | Fe, Ni           |           2.7 GK |      1 day |

#### B. Collapse Dynamics

- Core density increases to **≈ 10¹⁷ kg/m³** (comparable to atomic nuclei).
- Infall velocity reaches **≈ 70,000 km/s (≈ 0.23 c)**.
- Core temperature spikes to **≈ 10 GK**.
#### C. Supernova Explosion

- The collapse halts when **neutron degeneracy pressure** becomes dominant.
- A **shockwave** forms and ejects the star’s outer layers with kinetic energy **≈ 10⁴⁴ J**, equivalent to **10²⁸ times** the energy output of the Sun per second.
- Result: **Type II, Ib, or Ic supernova**, depending on envelope composition.

|           > 40            | Black Hole (direct collapse, possible gamma-ray burst) |            > 5 |        < 10 km | Core Collapse (no visible supernova) |
