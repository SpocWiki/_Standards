> In astronomy, the main sequence is a classification of stars 
> which appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness as a continuous and distinctive band. 
> 
> Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars, 
> and positions of stars on and off the band are believed to indicate their physical properties, 
> as well as their progress through several types of star life-cycles. 
> 
> These are the most numerous true stars in the universe and include the Sun. 
> Color-magnitude plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. 
>
> After condensation and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in its dense core region 
> through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. 
> 
> During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located on the main sequence 
> at a position determined primarily by its mass but also based on its chemical composition and age. 
> 
> The cores of main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, 
> where outward thermal pressure from the hot core 
> is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. 
> 
> The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation on temperature and pressure 
> helps to sustain this balance. 
> Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. 
> The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, 
> with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity, or both.
>
> The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, 
> based on the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. 
> The Sun, along with main sequence stars below about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun (1.5 M☉), 
> primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium, 
> a sequence called the proton–proton chain. 
> 
> Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly uses atoms of 
> carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. 
> 
> Main-sequence stars with more than two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, 
> which acts to stir up the newly created helium and maintain the fuel needed for fusion to occur. 
> 
> Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely radiative with convective zones near the surface. 
> With decreasing stellar mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases. 
> The main-sequence stars below 0.4 M☉ undergo convection throughout their mass. 
> When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded by an outer layer of hydrogen.
>
> The more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. 
> After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, 
> the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram, 
> into a supergiant, red giant, or directly to a white dwarf.
