## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that have more mass than the biggest gas giant planets, 
> but less than the least massive main-sequence stars.  
> 
> Their mass is approximately 13 to 80 times that of [[Solar_System/Jupiter|Jupiter]] (MJ)—
> not big enough to sustain nuclear fusion of [[../../../Chemistry/Chemical_Element/Group-01-Alkali/Hydrogen|hydrogen]] into [[../../../Chemistry/Chemical_Element/Group-18-Nobel-Gases/Helium|helium]] in their cores, 
> but massive enough to emit some light and heat from the fusion of [[../../../Chemistry/Chemical_Element/Group-01-Alkali/Hydrogen/Deuterium|deuterium]] (2H).  
> The most massive ones (> 65 MJ) can fuse [[../../../Chemistry/Chemical_Element/Group-01-Alkali/Lithium|lithium]] (7Li).
>
> Astronomers classify self-luminous objects by spectral type, 
> a distinction intimately tied to the surface temperature, and brown dwarfs occupy 
> types [[Star/Star~Class/Star-Class~M|Star-Class~M]] (2100–3500 K), [[Star/Star~Class/Star-Class~L|Star-Class~L]] (1300–2100 K), [[Star/Star~Class/Star-Class~T|Star-Class~T]] (600–1300 K), and [[Star/Star~Class/Star-Class~Y|Star-Class~Y]] (< 600 K). 
> 
> As brown dwarfs do not undergo stable hydrogen fusion, they cool down over time, 
> progressively passing through later spectral types as they age.
>
> Their name comes not from the color of light they emit but from their low luminosity, 
> falling below that of a white dwarf star but above the level of a gas giant. 
> To the naked eye, brown dwarfs would appear in different colors 
> depending on their temperature. 
> The warmest ones are possibly orange or red, 
> while cooler brown dwarfs would likely appear magenta or black to the human eye. 
> Brown dwarfs may be fully convective, with no layers or chemical differentiation by depth.
>
> Though their existence was initially theorized in the 1960s, 
> it was not until 1994 that the first unambiguous brown dwarfs were discovered. 
> As brown dwarfs have relatively low surface temperatures, 
> they are not very bright at visible wavelengths, emitting most of their light in the infrared. 
> 
> However, with the advent of more capable infrared detecting devices, 
> thousands of brown dwarfs have been identified. 
> The nearest known brown dwarfs are located in the Luhman 16 system, 
> a binary of L- and T-type brown dwarfs about 6.5 light-years (2.0 parsecs) from the Sun. 
> Luhman 16 is the third closest system to the Sun after [[Star/Toliman|Alpha Centauri]] and [[Star/Barnard's_Star|Barnard's Star]].
