> Stellar evolution is the process by which a star changes over the course of time. 
> 
> Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range 
> - from a few million years for the most massive 
> - to trillions of years for the least massive, 
>   which is considerably longer than the current age of the universe. 
> 
> The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses. 
> All stars are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, 
> often called nebulae or molecular clouds.  
> Over the course of millions of years, these protostars settle down into a state of equilibrium, 
> becoming what is known as a main sequence star.
>
> Nuclear fusion powers a star for most of its existence. 
> Initially the energy is generated by the 
> **fusion of hydrogen atoms at the core** of the main-sequence star. 
> Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes helium, stars like the Sun 
> begin to **fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell** surrounding the core. 
> 
> This process causes the star to gradually grow in size, 
> passing through the subgiant stage until it reaches the red-giant phase. 
> 
> Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to 
> generate energy through the **fusion of helium at their core**, whereas 
> more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric shells. 
> 
> Once a **star like the Sun** has exhausted its nuclear fuel, 
> its core collapses into a **dense white dwarf** 
> and the outer layers are expelled as a planetary nebula. 
> 
> Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun 
> can explode in a **supernova** as their inert iron cores collapse 
> into an extremely dense **neutron star or black hole**. 
> 
> Although the universe is not old enough for any of the smallest 
> **red dwarfs** to have reached the end of their existence, 
> stellar models suggest they will slowly become brighter and hotter 
> before running out of hydrogen fuel and **becoming low-mass white dwarfs**.
>
> Stellar evolution is not studied by observing the life of a single star, 
> as most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, even over many centuries. 
> 
> Instead, astrophysicists come to understand how stars evolve 
> by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, 
> and by simulating stellar structure using computer models.
