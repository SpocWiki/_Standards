> A white dwarf is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of **electron-degenerate matter**. 
> 
> A white dwarf is very dense: 
> in an Earth-sized volume, it packs a mass that is comparable to the Sun. 
> 
> No nuclear fusion takes place in a white dwarf; 
> what light it radiates is from its residual heat. 
> 
> The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, 
> the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. 
> 
> There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs 
> among the one hundred star systems nearest the Sun. 
> 
> The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. 
> The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Jacob Luyten in 1922.
>
> White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars 
> whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star or black hole. 
> 
> This includes **over 97% of the stars in the Milky Way**. 
> 
> After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of 
> low or intermediate mass ends, such a star will expand to a red giant 
> and **fuse helium to carbon and oxygen in its core** by the triple-alpha process. 
> 
> If a red giant has **insufficient mass** to generate the core temperatures 
> required to fuse carbon (around 109 K), 
> an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. 
> 
> After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, 
> it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. 
> 
> Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen (CO white dwarf). 
> If the mass of the progenitor is between 7 and 9 solar masses (M☉), 
> the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon, 
> in which case an oxygen–neon–magnesium (ONeMg or ONe) white dwarf may form. 
> 
> Stars of very low mass will be unable to fuse helium; 
> hence, a helium white dwarf may be formed 
> by mass loss in an interacting binary star system.
>
> Because the material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, 
> it lacks a heat source to support it against gravitational collapse. 
> 
> Instead, it is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure, 
> causing it to be extremely dense. 
> The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, 
> the Chandrasekhar limit—  approximately 1.44 times M☉— 
> beyond which electron degeneracy pressure cannot support it. 
> 
> A carbon–oxygen white dwarf which approaches this limit, 
> typically by mass transfer from a companion star, 
> may explode as a Type Ia supernova via a process known as carbon detonation; 
> SN 1006 is a likely example.
>
> A white dwarf, very hot when it forms, gradually cools as it radiates its energy. 
> This radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, 
> lessens and reddens over time. 
> 
> Eventually, a white dwarf will cool enough 
> that its material will begin to crystallize into a cold black dwarf. 
> 
> The oldest known white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of 
> a few thousand kelvins, which establishes an observational limit 
> on the maximum possible age of the universe.
