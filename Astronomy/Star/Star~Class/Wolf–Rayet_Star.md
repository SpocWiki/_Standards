## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Wolf–Rayet stars, often abbreviated as WR stars, are a rare heterogeneous set of stars 
> with unusual spectra showing prominent broad emission lines of ionised helium 
> and highly ionised nitrogen or carbon. 
> 
> The spectra indicate very high surface enhancement of heavy elements, 
> depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar winds. 
> The surface temperatures of known Wolf–Rayet stars range from 20,000 K 
> to around 210,000 K, hotter than almost all other kinds of stars. 
> They were previously called W-type stars referring to their spectral classification.
>
> Classic (or population I) Wolf–Rayet stars are evolved, massive stars 
> that have completely lost their outer hydrogen 
> and are fusing helium or heavier elements in the core. 
> 
> A subset of the population I WR stars show hydrogen lines in their spectra 
> and are known as WNh stars; they are young extremely massive stars still fusing hydrogen at the core, with helium and nitrogen exposed at the surface by strong mixing and radiation-driven mass loss. A separate group of stars with WR spectra are the central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe), post-asymptotic giant branch stars that were similar to the Sun while on the main sequence, but have now ceased fusion and shed their atmospheres to reveal a bare carbon-oxygen core.
>
> All Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects due to their high temperatures—thousands of times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun (L☉) for the CSPNe, hundreds of thousands L☉ for the population I WR stars, to over a million L☉ for the WNh stars—although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their radiation output is in the ultraviolet.
>
> The naked-eye star systems γ Velorum and θ Muscae both contain Wolf-Rayet stars, and two of the most massive known stars, BAT99-98 and R136a1 in 30 Doradus, are also Wolf–Rayet stars.
