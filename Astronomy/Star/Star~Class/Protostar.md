> A **Protostar** is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. 
> It is the earliest phase in the process of stellar evolution. 
> 
> For a low-mass star (i.e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years. 
> The phase begins when a molecular cloud fragment first collapses under the force of self-gravity 
> and an opaque, pressure-supported core forms inside the collapsing fragment. 
> 
> It ends when the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a pre-main-sequence star, 
> which contracts to later become a main-sequence star 
> at the onset of hydrogen fusion producing helium.
