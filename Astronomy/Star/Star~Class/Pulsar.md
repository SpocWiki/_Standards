> A **Pulsar** (pulsating star, on the model of quasar) is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star 
> that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. 
> 
> This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), 
> and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. 
> 
> Neutron stars are very dense and have short, regular rotational periods. 
> This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration).
>
> Pulsars’ highly regular pulses make them very useful tools for astronomers. For example, observations of a pulsar in a binary neutron star system were used to indirectly confirm the existence of gravitational radiation. The first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992 around a pulsar, specifically PSR B1257+12. In 1983, certain types of pulsars were detected that, at that time, exceeded the accuracy of atomic clocks in keeping time.
