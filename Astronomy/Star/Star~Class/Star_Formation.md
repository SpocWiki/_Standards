> Star formation is the process 
> by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space—
> sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "star-forming regions"—
> collapse and form stars. 
> 
> As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes 
> the study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) 
> as precursors to the star formation process, 
> and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products.  
> 
> It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy.  
> 
> Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, 
> must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function. 
> 
> Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a group of stars 
> referred  as star clusters or stellar associations.
