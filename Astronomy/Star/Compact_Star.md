> In astronomy, the term compact object (or compact star) refers collectively to 
> white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. It could also include exotic stars if such hypothetical, dense bodies are confirmed to exist. All compact objects have a high mass relative to their radius, giving them a very high density, compared to ordinary atomic matter.

> Compact objects are often the endpoints of stellar evolution and, in this respect, are also called stellar remnants. They can also be called dead stars in public communications. The state and type of a stellar remnant depends primarily on the mass of the star that it formed from. The ambiguous term compact object is often used when the exact nature of the star is not known, but evidence suggests that it has a very small radius compared to ordinary stars. A compact object that is not a black hole may be called a degenerate star.
