> A binary star or binary star system is a system of two stars 
> that are gravitationally bound to and in orbit around each other. 
> 
> Binary stars in the night sky that are seen as a single object to the naked eye 
> are often resolved as separate stars using a telescope, 
> in which case they are called visual binaries. 
> 
> Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia 
> and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. 
> They may also be detected by indirect techniques, 
> such as spectroscopy (spectroscopic binaries) or astrometry (astrometric binaries). 
> 
> If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along our line of sight, 
> its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called eclipsing binaries, 
> or, together with other binaries that change brightness as they orbit, photometric binaries.
>
> If components in binary star systems are close enough, they can gravitationally distort each other's outer stellar atmospheres. In some cases, these close binary systems can exchange mass, which may bring their evolution to stages that single stars cannot attain. Examples of binaries are Sirius, and Cygnus X-1 (Cygnus X-1 being a well-known black hole). Binary stars are also common as the nuclei of many planetary nebulae, and are the progenitors of both novae and type Ia supernovae.
