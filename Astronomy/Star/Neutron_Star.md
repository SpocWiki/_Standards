> A neutron star is the gravitationally collapsed core of a massive supergiant star. 
> 
> It results from the supernova explosion of a massive star—combined with gravitational collapse—
> that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. 
> 
> Surpassed only by black holes, neutron stars are the second smallest 
> and densest known class of stellar objects. 
> Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers (6 miles) 
> and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses (M☉). 
> 
> Stars that collapse into neutron stars have a total mass of between 10 and 25 M☉ 
> or possibly more for those that are especially rich in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.
>
> Once formed, neutron stars no longer actively generate heat and cool over time, 
> but they may still evolve further through collisions or accretion. 
> 
> Most of the basic models for these objects 
> imply that they are composed almost entirely of neutrons, 
> as the extreme pressure causes the electrons and protons present in normal matter 
> to combine into additional neutrons. 
> 
> These stars are partially supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, 
> just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. 
> 
> However, this is not by itself sufficient to hold up an object beyond 0.7 M☉ 
> and repulsive nuclear forces increasingly contribute to supporting more massive neutron stars. 
> 
> If the remnant star has a mass exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, 
> approximately 2.2 to 2.9 M☉, the combination of degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces 
> is insufficient to support the neutron star, causing it to collapse and form a black hole. 
> The most massive neutron star detected so far, PSR J0952–0607, is estimated to be 2.35±0.17 M☉.
>
> Newly formed neutron stars may have surface temperatures of ten million kelvin or more. 
> However, since neutron stars generate no new heat through fusion, 
> they inexorably cool down after their formation. 
> 
> Still, surface temperatures will be around one million kelvin after one thousand to one million years, 
> and older, even cooler neutron stars are still easy to discover. 
> 
> For example, the well-studied neutron star, RX J1856.5−3754, 
> has an average surface temperature of about 434e3K. 
> By comparison, the effective surface temperature of the Sun is only 5780 K.
>
> Neutron star material is remarkably dense: 
> a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star material 
> would have a weight of approximately 3 billion tonnes, 
> the same weight as a 0.5-cubic-kilometer chunk of the Earth 
> (a cube with edges of about 800 meters) from Earth's surface.
>
> As a star's core collapses, its rotation rate increases due to conservation of angular momentum, 
> so newly formed neutron stars typically rotate at up to several hundred times per second. 
> 
> Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation 
> that make them detectable as pulsars, 
> and the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish in 1967 
> was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. 
> 
> The fastest-spinning neutron star known is PSR J1748−2446ad, 
> rotating at a rate of 716 times per second or 42960 revolutions per minute, 
> giving a linear (tangential) speed at the surface on the order of 0.24‍c 
> (i.e., nearly a quarter the speed of light).
>
> There are thought to be around one billion neutron stars in the Milky Way, 
> and at a minimum several hundred million, 
> a figure obtained by estimating the number of stars that have undergone supernova explosions. 
> 
> However, many of them have existed for a long period of time 
> and have cooled down considerably. 
> 
> These stars radiate very little electromagnetic radiation; 
> most neutron stars that have been detected occur 
> only in certain situations in which they do radiate, 
> such as if they are a pulsar or a part of a binary system. 
> 
> Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are difficult to detect, 
> due to the absence of electromagnetic radiation; 
> however, since the Hubble Space Telescope's detection of RX J1856.5−3754 in the 1990s, 
> a few nearby neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected.
>
> Neutron stars in binary systems can undergo accretion, 
> in which case they emit large amounts of X-rays. 
> 
> During this process, matter is deposited on the surface of the stars, 
> forming "hotspots" that can be sporadically identified as X-ray pulsar systems. 
> 
> Additionally, such accretions are able to "recycle" old pulsars, causing them to gain mass and rotate extremely quickly, forming millisecond pulsars. 
> 
> Furthermore, binary systems such as these continue to evolve, with many companions 
> eventually becoming compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars themselves, 
> though other possibilities include a complete destruction of the companion through ablation or collision.
>
> The study of neutron star systems is central to gravitational wave astronomy. 
> The merger of binary neutron stars produces gravitational waves and is associated with kilonovae and short gamma-ray bursts. 
> 
> In 2017, the LIGO and Virgo interferometer sites observed GW170817, the first direct detection of gravitational waves from such an event. 
> Prior to this, indirect evidence for gravitational waves was inferred 
> by studying the gravity radiated from the orbital decay of a different type of (unmerged) binary neutron system, the Hulse–Taylor pulsar.
