This Folder contains not only the 12 Zodiacs along the Ecliptic, 
but all 88 Star-Constellations, to totally partition the Night Sky. 

This Mercator Projection of the night sky shows most of the Constellations described here. 
The Milky Way is projected as a white Band  through the Equator formed by the Earth's Ecliptic Plane.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **constellation** is an area on the celestial sphere 
> in which a group of visible stars forms a perceived pattern or outline, 
> typically representing an animal, mythological subject, or inanimate object.
>
> The first constellations were likely defined in prehistory. 
> People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, creation, and mythology. 
> Different cultures and countries invented their own constellations, 
> some of which lasted into the early 20th century 
> before today's constellations were internationally recognized. 
> 
> The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. 
> Many changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. 
> Some were limited to a single culture or nation. 
> Naming constellations also helped astronomers and navigators identify stars more easily.
>
> Twelve (or thirteen) ancient constellations belong to the zodiac 
> (straddling the ecliptic, which the Sun, Moon, and planets all traverse). 
> 
> The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; 
> its astrological divisions became prominent c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean astronomy. 
> 
> Constellations appear in Western culture via Greece 
> and are mentioned in the works of Hesiod, Eudoxus and Aratus. 
> 
> The traditional 48 constellations, consisting of the zodiac and 36 more 
> (now 38, following the division of Argo Navis into three constellations) 
> are listed by Ptolemy, a Greco-Roman astronomer from Alexandria, Egypt, in his Almagest. 
> 
> The formation of constellations was the subject of extensive mythology, 
> most notably in the Metamorphoses of the Latin poet Ovid. 
> 
> Constellations in the far southern sky were added from the 15th until the mid-18th century 
> when European explorers began traveling to the Southern Hemisphere. 
> Due to Roman and European transmission, each constellation has a Latin name.
>
> In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) 
> formally accepted the modern list of 88 constellations, 
> and in 1928 adopted official constellation boundaries 
> that together cover the entire celestial sphere. 
> 
> Any given point in a celestial coordinate system lies in one of the modern constellations. 
> Some astronomical naming systems include the constellation 
> where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. 
> The Flamsteed designation of a star, for example, 
> consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation's name.
>
> Other star patterns or groups called asterisms are not constellations under the formal definition, 
> but are also used by observers to navigate the night sky. 
> 
> Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, 
> or they may share stars with more than one constellation. 
> Examples of asterisms include the teapot within the constellation Sagittarius, 
> or the Big Dipper in the constellation of Ursa Major.
