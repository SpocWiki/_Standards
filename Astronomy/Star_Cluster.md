> A **Star cluster** is a group of stars held together by self-gravitation. 
> Two main types of star clusters can be distinguished: 
> - globular clusters, tight groups of ten thousand to millions of old stars which are gravitationally bound; 
> - and open clusters, less tight groups of stars, generally containing fewer than a few hundred members.
>
> As they move through the galaxy, over time, open clusters become disrupted by the gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds, so that the clusters we observe are often young. Even though they are no longer gravitationally bound, they will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space and are then known as stellar associations, sometimes referred to as moving groups. Globular clusters, with more members and more mass, remain intact for far longer and the globular clusters observed are usually billions of years old.
>
> Star clusters visible to the naked eye include the Pleiades and Hyades open clusters, and the globular cluster 47 Tucanae.
