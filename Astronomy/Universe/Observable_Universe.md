> The observable universe is a spherical region of the universe 
> consisting of all matter that can be observed from Earth; 
> the electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time 
> to reach the Solar System and Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. 
> 
> Assuming the universe is isotropic, 
> the distance to the edge of the observable universe is the same in every direction. 
> That is, the observable universe is a spherical region centered on the observer. 
> 
> Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, 
> which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.
>
> The word observable in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology 
> to detect light or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. 
> 
> It refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself. 
> No signal can travel faster than light, hence there is a maximum distance, 
> called the particle horizon, beyond which nothing can be detected, 
> as the signals could not have reached the observer yet.
>
> According to calculations, the current comoving distance to particles from which 
> the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, 
> which represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years). 
> 
> The comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs 
> (about 46.6 billion light-years), about 2% larger. 
> The radius of the observable universe is therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years. 
> 
> Using the critical density and the diameter of the observable universe, 
> the total mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be calculated to be about 1.5×1053 kg. 
> In November 2018, astronomers reported that extragalactic background light (EBL) amounted to 4×10^84 photons.
>
> As the universe's expansion is accelerating, all currently observable objects, 
> outside the local supercluster, will eventually appear to freeze in time, 
> while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. 
> 
> For instance, objects with the current redshift z from 5 to 10 
> will only be observable up to an age of 4–6 billion years. 
> 
> In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance 
> (currently about 19 gigaparsecs (62 Gly)) will never reach Earth.
