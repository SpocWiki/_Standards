> Galaxy morphological classification is a system used by astronomers 
> to divide galaxies into groups based on their visual appearance. 
> 
> There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, 
> the most famous being the Hubble sequence, devised by Edwin Hubble 
> and later expanded by GÃ©rard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. 
> 
> However, galaxy classification and morphology 
> are now largely done using computational methods and physical morphology.
