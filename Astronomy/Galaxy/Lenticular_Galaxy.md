> A lenticular galaxy (denoted S0) is a type of galaxy 
> intermediate between an elliptical (denoted E) and a spiral galaxy 
> in galaxy morphological classification schemes. 
> 
> It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms.  
> Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter 
> and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. 
> 
> They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. 
> As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies).  
> 
> Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies 
> share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. 
> 
> Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, 
> at least in the local part of the Universe.  
> 
> Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs.
