> In astronomy, an epoch or reference epoch is a moment in time 
> used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity. 
> 
> It is useful for the celestial coordinates or orbital elements of a celestial body, 
> as they are subject to perturbations and vary with time. 
> 
> These time-varying astronomical quantities might include, for example, 
> the mean longitude or mean anomaly of a body, the node of its orbit relative to a reference plane, 
> the direction of the apogee or aphelion of its orbit, or the size of the major axis of its orbit.
>
> The main use of astronomical quantities specified in this way is 
> to calculate other relevant parameters of motion, in order to predict future positions and velocities. 
> The applied tools of the disciplines of celestial mechanics or its subfield orbital mechanics 
> (for predicting orbital paths and positions for bodies in motion under the gravitational effects of other bodies) 
> can be used to generate an ephemeris, 
> a table of values giving the positions and velocities of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times.
>
> Astronomical quantities can be specified in any of several ways, 
> for example, as a polynomial function of the time interval, 
> with an epoch as a temporal point of origin (this is a common current way of using an epoch). 
> Alternatively, the time-varying astronomical quantity can be expressed as a constant, 
> equal to the measure that it had at the epoch, leaving its variation over time to be specified in some other way—
> for example, by a table, as was common during the 17th and 18th centuries.
>
> The word epoch was often used in a different way in older astronomical literature, 
> e.g. during the 18th century, in connection with astronomical tables.  
> 
> At that time, it was customary to denote as "epochs", 
> not the standard date and time of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities, 
> but rather the values at that date and time of those time-varying quantities themselves. 
> 
> In accordance with that alternative historical usage, an expression such as "correcting the epochs" 
> would refer to the adjustment, usually by a small amount, of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities 
> applicable to a fixed standard date and time of reference 
> (and not, as might be expected from current usage, 
> to a change from one date and time of reference to a different date and time).
