## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Big Bang** is a physical theory that describes how 
> the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. 
> 
> The concept of an expanding universe was scientifically 
> originated by physicist Alexander Friedmann in 1922 
> with the mathematical derivation of the Friedmann equations. 
> 
> The earliest empirical observation of an expanding universe is known as Hubble's law, 
> published in work by physicist Edwin Hubble in 1929, 
> which discerned that galaxies are moving away from Earth 
> at a rate that accelerates proportionally with distance. 
> 
> Independent of Friedmann's work, and independent of Hubble's observations, 
> physicist Georges Lemaître proposed that the universe emerged from a "primeval atom" in 1931, 
> introducing the modern notion of the Big Bang.
>
> Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe 
> from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. 
> These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, 
> including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, 
> and large-scale structure. 
> The uniformity of the universe, known as the flatness problem, 
> is explained through cosmic inflation: 
> a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments.
>
> Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backward in time using the known laws of physics, 
> the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity 
> in which space and time lose meaning (typically named "the Big Bang singularity"). 
> 
> Physics lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity 
> that can model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang. 
> In 1964 the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists 
> that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified, 
> since the Big Bang models predict a uniform background radiation 
> caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past. 
> 
> A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, 
> which is now essentially universally accepted. 
> Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe 
> place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.020 billion years ago, 
> which is considered the age of the universe. 
> 
> Strangely the Radius of the (observable) Universe is 45 billion light-years, 
> which results from the fact that the light reaching us from 13.8 bio years ago 
> had to travel 3 times the distance to cover up for the expansion that happened since then. 
>
> There remain aspects of the observed universe 
> that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models.  
> 
> After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently 
> to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. 
> 
> The unequal abundances of matter and antimatter that allowed this to occur 
> is an unexplained effect known as baryon asymmetry. 
> 
> These primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—
> later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies. 
> 
> Astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. 
> Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, 
> and the Big Bang models and various observations indicate 
> that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. 
> Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that 
> the expansion of the universe is accelerating, 
> an observation attributed to an unexplained phenomenon known as dark energy.
