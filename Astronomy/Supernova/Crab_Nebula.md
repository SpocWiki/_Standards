> The **Crab Nebula** (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant 
> and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. 
> 
> The common name comes from a drawing that somewhat resembled a crab with arms 
> produced by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, in 1842 or 1843 using a 36-inch (91 cm) telescope. 
> The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. 
> It corresponds with a bright supernova observed in 1054 C.E. by Native American, Japanese, 
> and Arabic stargazers; this supernova was also recorded by Chinese astronomers as a guest star. 
> The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that corresponds with a historically-observed supernova explosion.
>
> At an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn's moon Titan, 
> it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. 
> The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. 
> It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, 
> and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% of the speed of light.
>
> The Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28â€“30 kilometres across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, 
> lies at the center of the Crab Nebula. 
> 
> The star emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. 
> At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, 
> the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent gamma-ray source in the sky, 
> with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. 
> 
> The nebula's radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that occult it. 
> In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped 
> from observations of the Crab Nebula's radio waves passing through it, and 
> in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured 
> as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.
