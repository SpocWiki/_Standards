> Extraterrestrial life, or alien life (colloquially, aliens), is life that originates from another world rather than on Earth. 
> No extraterrestrial life has yet been scientifically conclusively detected. 
> Such life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings, 
> possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more, or far less, advanced than humans. 
> 
> The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. 
> The science of extraterrestrial life is known as [[../Astrobiology]] .
>
> Speculation about the possibility of inhabited worlds beyond Earth dates back to antiquity. 
> Early Christian writers discussed the idea of a "plurality of worlds" 
> as proposed by earlier thinkers such as Democritus; 
> Augustine references Epicurus's idea of innumerable worlds 
> "throughout the boundless immensity of space" in The City of God.
>
> Pre-modern writers typically assumed extraterrestrial "worlds" were inhabited by living beings. 
> William Vorilong, in the 15th century, 
> acknowledged the possibility Jesus could have visited extraterrestrial worlds to redeem their inhabitants. 
> Nicholas of Cusa wrote in 1440 that Earth is "a brilliant star" like other celestial objects visible in space; 
> which would appear similar to the Sun, from an exterior perspective, 
> due to a layer of "fiery brightness" in the outer layer of the atmosphere. 
> 
> He theorized all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, plants, and animals, including the Sun. 
> 
> Descartes wrote that there were no means to prove the stars were not inhabited by "intelligent creatures", 
> but their existence was a matter of speculation.
>
> In comparison to the life-abundant Earth, 
> the vast majority of intrasolar and extrasolar planets and moons have harsh surface conditions 
> and disparate atmospheric chemistry, or lack an atmosphere. 
> 
> However, there are many extreme and chemically harsh ecosystems on Earth that do support forms of life 
> and are often hypothesized to be the origin of life on Earth. 
> Examples include life surrounding hydrothermal vents, acidic hot springs, and volcanic lakes, 
> as well as halophiles and the deep biosphere.
>
> Since the mid-20th century, active research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life, 
> encompassing searches for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Solar system exploration has investigated conditions for life, especially on Venus, Mars, Europa, and Titan. Exoplanets were first detected in 1992. As of 14 August 2025, there are 5,983 confirmed exoplanets in 4,470 planetary systems, with 1,001 systems having more than one planet. Depending on the category of search, methods range from analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and transmit interstellar communication. Interstellar travel remains largely hypothetical, with only the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes confirmed to have entered the interstellar medium.

> The concept of extraterrestrial life, particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, especially extraterrestrials in fiction. Science fiction has communicated scientific ideas, imagined a range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives on extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to try to contact intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others – citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or destroy less advanced societies – argue it may be dangerous to actively draw attention to Earth.
