> In astronomy, extinction is the absorption and scattering of [[../Science/Physics/Fundamental_Interaction/Electromagnetism/Electromagnetic_Radiation|electromagnetic radiation]] by dust and gas 
> between an emitting astronomical object and the observer. 
> 
> Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by Robert Julius Trumpler. 
> However, its effects had been noted in 1847 by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, 
> and its effect on the colors of stars had been observed by a number of individuals 
> who did not connect it with the general presence of galactic dust.

> For stars lying near the plane of the Milky Way which are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth, extinction in the visual band of frequencies (photometric system) is roughly 1.8 magnitudes per kiloparsec.

> For Earth-bound observers, extinction arises both from the interstellar medium and the Earth's atmosphere; it may also arise from circumstellar dust around an observed object. Strong extinction in Earth's atmosphere of some wavelength regions (such as X-ray, ultraviolet, and infrared) is overcome by the use of space-based observatories. Since blue light is much more strongly attenuated than red light, extinction causes objects to appear redder than expected; this phenomenon is called interstellar reddening.
