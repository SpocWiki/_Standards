BQL	Becquerel	The SI derived unit of radioactivity. One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. SI uses the becquerel rather than the second for the unit of activity measure to avoid dangerous mistakes: a measurement in becquerels is proportional to activity, and thus a more dangerous source of radiation gives a higher reading. A measurement in seconds is inversely proportional.

D70	Calorie	A calorie is 1/100 of the amount of energy required to warm one gram of air-free water from 0 °C to 100 °C at standard atmospheric pressure; this is about 4.190 J. Its use is archaic, having been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule. However, in many countries it remains in common use as a unit of food energy. In the context of nutrition, and especially food labelling, the calorie is approximately equal to 4.1868 joules (J), and energy values are normally quoted in kilojoules (kJ) and kilocalories (kcal). This code is being deprecated. Use code E14 Kilocalorie to express food calories.

DRI	Dram (UK)	The dram (archaic spelling drachm) was historically both a coin and a weight. Currently it is both a small mass in the Apothecaries' system of weights and a small unit of volume. This unit is called more correctly fluid dram or in contraction also fluidram. The fluid dram is defined as 1⁄8 of a fluid ounce, which means it is exactly equal to 3.551 632 812 500 0 mL in the Commonwealth and Ireland. In England dram came to mean a small draught of cordial or alcohol; hence the term dram-house for the taverns where one could purchase a dram.
DRA	Dram (US)	The dram (archaic spelling drachm) was historically both a coin and a weight. Currently it is both a small mass in the Apothecaries' system of weights and a small unit of volume.

The term also refers to the fluid dram, a measure of capacity equal 1⁄8 of a fluid ounce, which means it is exactly equal to 3.696 691 195 312 5 mL in the United States.

H79	French gauge	The French scale (most correctly abbreviated as Fr, but also often abbreviated as FR or F) is commonly used to measure the catheter size (Circumference is in millimeters), in which 1 Fr = 0.33 mm in diameter. In the French Gauge system as it is also known, the diameter in millimeters of the catheter can be determined by dividing the French size by 3, thus an increasing French size corresponds with a larger diameter catheter. The following equations summarize the relationships: D(mm) = Fr/3 or Fr = D(mm)*3

The term density here is used somewhat incorrectly, as density is mass by volume. More precisely, it is a measure of the area density, areal density, or surface density.

Because of this, one can measure the number of moles in a pure substance by weighing it and comparing the result to its molecular or atomic weight

(Usage- The pennyweight is the common weight used in the valuation and measurement of precious metals. Jewellers use the pennyweight in calculating the amount and cost of precious metals used in fabricating or casting jewellery. Similarly, dentists and dental labs still use the pennyweight as the measure of precious metals in dental crowns and inlays.)

80	Pound per square inch - Absolute	Psia (pound-force per square inch absolute)is a unit of pressure pressure relative to a vacuum (such as that in space).At sea level, Earth's atmosphere actually exerts a pressure of 14.7 psi. Humans do not feel this pressure because internal pressure of liquid in their bodies matches the external pressure. If a pressure gauge is calibrated to read zero in space, then at sea level on Earth it would read 14.7 psi. Thus a reading of 30 psig, on Earth, on a tire gauge represents an absolute pressure of 44.7 psi (lb/in2).
64	Pound per square inch - Gauge	Psig (pound-force per square inch gauge) is a unit of pressure relative to the surrounding atmosphere. At sea level, Earth's atmosphere actually exerts a pressure of 14.7 psi. Humans do not feel this pressure because internal pressure of liquid in their bodies matches the external pressure. If a pressure gauge is calibrated to read zero in space, then at sea level on Earth it would read 14.7 psi. Thus a reading of 30 psig, on Earth, on a tire gauge represents an absolute pressure of 44.7 psi (lb/in2).

PS	Pound-force per square inch	The pound-force per square inch (symbol: psi or lbf/in2 or lbf/in2) is a unit of pressure or of stress based on avoirdupois units. It is the pressure resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch. Other abbreviations are used that append a modifier to "psi". However, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends that, to avoid confusion, any modifiers be instead applied to the quantity being measured rather than the unit of measure[1] For example, "Pg = 100 psi" rather than "P = 100 psig".
