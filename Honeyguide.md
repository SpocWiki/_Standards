## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Honeyguides (family **Indicatoridae**) are a family of birds in the order Piciformes. 
> They are also known as indicator birds, or honey birds, 
> although the latter term is also used more narrowly to refer to the genus Prodotiscus. 
> 
> They have an Old World tropical distribution, 
> with the greatest number of species in Africa and two in Asia. 
> 
> These birds are best known for their interaction with humans. 
> Honeyguides are noted and named for one or two species 
> that will deliberately lead humans directly to bee colonies, 
> so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind. 
> 
> Localized interaction between honeyguides and honey badgers has been reported.
