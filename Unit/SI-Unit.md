# [[SI-Units]] 

## Edit

SI-Units are defined since 1967 and standardized in ISO_80000.

> The **International System of Units**, internationally known by the abbreviation SI 
> (from French Système international d'unités), is the modern form of 
> the metric system and the world's most widely used system of measurement. 
> 
> It is the only system of measurement with official status in nearly every country in the world, 
> employed in science, technology, industry, and everyday commerce. 
> The SI system is coordinated by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures 
> which is abbreviated BIPM from French: Bureau international des poids et mesures.
>
> The SI comprises a coherent system of units of measurement starting with seven base units, 
> which are the second (symbol s, the unit of time), metre (m, length), kilogram (kg, mass), 
> ampere (A, electric current), kelvin (K, thermodynamic temperature), 
> mole (mol, amount of substance), and candela (cd, luminous intensity). 
> 
> The system can accommodate coherent units for an unlimited number of additional quantities.
>  These are called coherent derived units, 
>  which can always be represented as products of powers of the base units. 
>  Twenty-two coherent derived units have been provided with special names and symbols.
>
> The seven base units and the 22 coherent derived units with special names and symbols may be used in combination to express other coherent derived units. Since the sizes of coherent units will be convenient for only some applications and not for others, the SI provides twenty-four prefixes which, when added to the name and symbol of a coherent unit produce twenty-four additional (non-coherent) SI units for the same quantity; these non-coherent units are always decimal (i.e. power-of-ten) multiples and sub-multiples of the coherent unit.
>
> The current way of defining the SI is a result of a decades-long move towards increasingly abstract and idealised formulation in which the realisations of the units are separated conceptually from the definitions. A consequence is that as science and technologies develop, new and superior realisations may be introduced without the need to redefine the unit. One problem with artefacts is that they can be lost, damaged, or changed; another is that they introduce uncertainties that cannot be reduced by advancements in science and technology.
>
> The original motivation for the development of the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the centimetre–gram–second (CGS) systems (specifically the inconsistency between the systems of electrostatic units and electromagnetic units) and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The General Conference on Weights and Measures (French: Conférence générale des poids et mesures – CGPM), which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to establish the definitions and standards of a new system and to standardise the rules for writing and presenting measurements. The system was published in 1960 as a result of an initiative that began in 1948, and is based on the metre–kilogram–second system of units (MKS) combined with ideas from the development of the CGS system.
