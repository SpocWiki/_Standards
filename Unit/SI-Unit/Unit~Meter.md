> The metre (or **meter** in American spelling; symbol: m) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI).
>
> The metre was originally defined in 1791 by the French National Assembly as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle, 
> so the Earth's polar circumference is approximately 40000 km.
>
> In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar, the bar used was changed in 1889, and in 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to clarify that the metre is a measure of proper length. From 1983 until 2019, the metre was formally defined as the **length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a second**. After the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, this definition was rephrased to include the definition of a second in terms of the caesium frequency ΔνCs.

> This series of amendments did **not** alter the size of the metre significantly - today Earth's polar circumference measures 40007.863 km, a change of 0.02% from the original value of exactly 40000 km, which also includes improvements in the accuracy of measuring the circumference.
