> The **second** (symbol: s) is the unit of time in the International System of Units (SI), historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes and finally to 60 seconds each (24 × 60 × 60 = 86400).
>
> The current and formal definition in the International System of Units (SI) is more precise: The second is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the **caesium frequency**, ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1.
>
> This current definition was adopted in 1967 when it became feasible to define the second based on fundamental properties of nature with caesium clocks. 
> 
> Because the speed of Earth's rotation varies and is slowing ever so slightly, a leap second is added at irregular intervals to civil time to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.
