> **James Watt**  (; 30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 OS) â€“ 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, 
> mechanical engineer, and chemist 
> who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine 
> with his Watt steam engine in 1776, 
> which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution 
> in both his native country Great Britain, and the rest of the world. 
>
> While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, 
> Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. 
> At the time engineers such as John Smeaton were aware of the inefficiencies of Newcomen's engine 
> and aimed to improve it. 
> 
> Watt's insight was to realize that contemporary engine designs 
> wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. 
> Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, 
> which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, 
> and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. 
> Eventually, he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, 
> greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.
>
> Watt attempted to commercialize his invention, 
> but experienced great financial difficulties 
> until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775. 
> 
> The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. 
> In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions 
> though none was as significant as his steam engine work.
>
> As Watt developed the concept of horsepower, the SI unit of power, the watt, was named after him.
