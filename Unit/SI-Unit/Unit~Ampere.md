> The **Ampere** ( AM-pair, US:  AM-peer; symbol: A), often shortened to amp, 
> is the unit of electric current in the International System of Units (SI).  
> 
> One ampere is equal to 1 coulomb, or 6.241509074×10^18 electrons' worth of charge, 
> moving past a point in a second. 
> 
> It is named after French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836), 
> considered the father of electromagnetism along with Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted.
>
> As of the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, 
> the ampere is defined by **fixing the elementary charge e to be exactly 1.602176634×10−19 C (coulomb)**, 
> which means an ampere is an electric current equivalent to 10[^19] elementary charges 
> moving every 1.602176634 seconds 
> or 6.241509074×10[^18] elementary charges moving in a second. 
> 
> Prior to the redefinition the ampere was defined as the current passing through 2 parallel wires 1 Meter apart 
> that produces a magnetic force of 2×10−7 newtons per Meter.
>
> The earlier CGS system has two units of current, 
> one structured similar to the SI's and the other using Coulomb's law as a fundamental relationship, 
> with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates. 
> 
> The unit of current is then defined as one unit of charge per second. 
> 
> In SI, the unit of charge, the coulomb, is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second.
