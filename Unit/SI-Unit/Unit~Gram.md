> The **gram** (originally gramme; SI unit symbol g) is a unit of [[Dim~mass]] in the International System of Units (SI) equal to one one thousandth of a kilogram.
>
> Originally defined as of 1795 as "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water 
> equal to the cube of the hundredth part of a metre [1 cm³], and at the temperature of melting ice", 
> the defining temperature (~0 °C) was later changed to 4 °C, 
> the temperature of maximum density of water.
>
> However, by the late 19th century, there was an effort to make the base unit the kilogram 
> and the gram a derived unit. 
> In 1960, the new International System of Units defined  a gram as one one-thousandth of a kilogram 
> (i.e., one gram is 1×10−3 kg). 
> 
> The kilogram, as of 2019, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures 
> from the fixed numerical value of the **Planck constant (h)**.

Since the Planck-Constant combined with the Caesium Frequency yields an Energy and Energy is equivalent to mass using E=m* c² an equivalent Mass can be defined.
