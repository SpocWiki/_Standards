> The **Steradian** (symbol: sr) or square radian is the unit of solid angle 
> in the International System of Units (SI). 
> 
> It is used in three dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, 
> which quantifies planar angles. 
> 
> Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, 
> gives a length of a circular arc on the circumference, 
> a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, 
> gives the area of a spherical cap on the surface. 
> 
> The name is derived from the Greek στερεός stereos 'solid' + radian.
>
> The steradian is a dimensionless unit, 
> the quotient of the area subtended 
> and the square of its distance from the centre. 
> 
> Both the numerator and denominator of this ratio 
> have dimension length squared (i.e. L²/L² = 1, dimensionless). 
> 
> It is useful, however, 
> to distinguish between dimensionless quantities of a different kind, 
> such as the radian (a ratio of quantities of dimension length), 
> so the symbol "sr" is used to indicate a solid angle. 
> 
> For example, radiant intensity can be measured in watts per steradian (W⋅sr−1). 
> The steradian was formerly an SI supplementary unit, 
> but this category was abolished in 1995 
> and the steradian is now considered an SI derived unit.
