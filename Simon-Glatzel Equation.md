> The Simonâ€“Glatzel equation is an empirical correlation 
> describing the pressure dependence of the melting temperature of a solid. 
> 
> The pressure dependence of the melting temperature is small for small pressure changes 
> because the volume change during fusion or melting is rather small. 
> 
> However, at very high pressures higher melting temperatures are generally observed 
> as the liquid usually occupies a larger volume than the solid 
> making melting more thermodynamically unfavorable at elevated pressure. 
> 
> If the liquid has a smaller volume than the solid (as for ice and liquid water) 
> a higher pressure leads to a **lower** melting point.
