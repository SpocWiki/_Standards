> In philosophy, events are objects in time or instantiations of properties in objects. 
> On some views, only changes in the form of acquiring or losing a property can constitute events, like the lawn's becoming dry. 
> According to others, there are also events that involve nothing but the retaining of a property, e.g. the lawn's staying wet. 
> 
> Events are usually defined as particulars that, unlike universals, cannot repeat at different times. 
> Processes are complex events constituted by a sequence of events. 
> But even simple events can be conceived as complex entities involving an object, a time and the property exemplified by the object at this time. 
> 
> Traditionally, metaphysicians tended to emphasize static being over dynamic events. 
> This tendency has been opposed by so-called process philosophy or process ontology, which ascribes ontological primacy to events and processes.
