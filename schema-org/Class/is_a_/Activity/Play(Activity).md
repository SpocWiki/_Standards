## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Play is a range of intrinsically motivated activities done for recreation. 
> Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, 
> but may be engaged in at any life stage, 
> and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably mammals and birds.
>
> Play is often interpreted as frivolous; 
> yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, 
> particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a game. 
> 
> Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited, spontaneous, and frivolous 
> to planned or even compulsive. 
> 
> Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as hand-eye coordination), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures, and the way that children engage with play varies.
