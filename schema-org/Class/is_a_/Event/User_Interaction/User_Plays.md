Class of all user_playss.

[[User_Interaction]] and its subtypes are an old way of counting users interacting with pages. 
It is generally better to use [[../Intangible/structured_value/interaction_counter|InteractionCounter]]s with an [[../../../Relation/has/has_interaction_type|interaction-type]]- Relation to the extensible [[Action]] vocabulary, in this case [[../../action/play_action|play-action]], alongside types such as [[../../../../../Society/Communication/Media/Creative_Work/Comment]].

Tag Instances like this:
