> A **Party** is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host 
> for the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, 
> or as part of a festival or other commemoration or celebration of a special occasion. 
> 
> A party will often feature food and beverages, 
> and generally conversation, music, dancing, or other forms of entertainment. 
>
> Some parties are held in honor of a specific person, day, or event, 
> such as a birthday party, a Super Bowl party, or a St. Patrick's Day party. 
> 
> Parties of this kind are often called celebrations. 
> A party is not necessarily a private occasion. 
> Public parties are sometimes held in parks, restaurants, pubs, beer gardens, nightclubs, or bars, 
> and people attending such parties may be charged an admission fee by the host. 
> 
> Large parties in public streets may celebrate events such as Mardi Gras 
> or the signing of a peace treaty ending a long war.
