The act of physically/electronically taking delivery of an object that has been transferred from an origin to a destination. Reciprocal of SendAction.

<ul>
<li>[[SendAction]]: The reciprocal of ReceiveAction.</li>
<li>[[TakeAction]]: Unlike TakeAction, ReceiveAction does not imply that the ownership has been transferred (e.g. I can receive a package, but it does not mean the package is now mine).</li>
</ul>
