#is_a_/send_action

The act of physically/electronically dispatching an object for transfer from an origin to a destination. Related actions:

<ul>
<li>[[ReceiveAction]]: The reciprocal of SendAction.</li>
<li>[[GiveAction]]: Unlike GiveAction, SendAction does not imply the transfer of ownership (e.g. I can send you my laptop, but I'm not necessarily giving it to you).</li>
</ul>
