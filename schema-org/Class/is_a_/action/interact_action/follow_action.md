<li>[[SubscribeAction]]: Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active agent constantly/actively polling for updates.</li>
<li>[[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates from the object.</li>
<li>[[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in getting updates from the object.</li>
<li>[[TrackAction]]: Unlike TrackAction, FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects rather than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you don't follow it).</li>
</ul>
