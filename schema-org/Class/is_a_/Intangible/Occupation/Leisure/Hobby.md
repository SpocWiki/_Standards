> identifies hobbies under three sub-categories: 
> - casual leisure, which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity 
>   requiring little or no preparation; 
> - serious leisure, which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer 
>   that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment; and 
> - finally project-based leisure, which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding.
