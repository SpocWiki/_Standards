> A **Hobby** is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, 
> typically during one's leisure time. 
> 
> Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, 
> engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, 
> or pursuing other amusements or avocations. 
> 
> Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. 
> 
> A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, 
> making it diverse and lengthy. 
> Hobbies tend to follow trends in society. 
> 
> For example, stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries 
> as postal systems were the main means of communication; 
> as of 2024, video games became more popular following technological advances. 
> 
> The advancing production, technology, and labour movements of the nineteenth century 
> provided workers with more leisure time to engage in hobbies. 
> Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.
>
> There are various types of hobbies, which can be classified in various ways, 
> including subject matter, degree of time commitment, and social versus solitary nature. 
> 
> The Serious Leisure Perspective of Robert Stebbins 
> identifies hobbies under three sub-categories: 
> - casual leisure, which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity 
>   requiring little or no preparation; 
> - serious leisure, which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer 
>   that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment; and 
> - finally project-based leisure, which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding.
