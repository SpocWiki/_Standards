> **Aggression** is behavior aimed at opposing or attacking something or someone. 
> Though often done with the intent to cause harm, 
> some might channel it into creative and practical outlets. 
> 
> It may occur either reactively or without provocation. 
> In humans, aggression can be caused by various triggers. 
> For example, built-up frustration due to blocked goals or perceived disrespect. 
> 
> Human aggression can be classified into direct and indirect aggression; 
> while the former is characterized by physical or verbal behavior 
> intended to cause harm to someone, 
> the latter is characterized by behavior intended to harm the social relations of an individual or group.
>
> In definitions commonly used in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, 
> aggression is an action or response by an individual 
> that delivers something unpleasant to another person. 
> 
> Some definitions include that the individual must intend to harm another person.
>
> In an interdisciplinary perspective, aggression is regarded as "an ensemble of mechanism formed during the course of evolution in order to assert oneself, relatives, or friends against others, to gain or to defend resources (ultimate causes) by harmful damaging means. These mechanisms are often motivated by emotions like fear, frustration, anger, feelings of stress, dominance or pleasure (proximate causes). Sometimes aggressive behavior serves as a stress relief or a subjective feeling of power." Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species may not be considered aggression in the same sense.

> Aggression can take a variety of forms, which may be expressed physically, or communicated verbally or non-verbally, including: anti-predator aggression, defensive aggression (fear-induced), predatory aggression, dominance aggression, inter-male aggression, resident-intruder aggression, maternal aggression, species-specific aggression, sex-related aggression, territorial aggression, isolation-induced aggression, irritable aggression, and brain-stimulation-induced aggression (hypothalamus). There are two subtypes of human aggression: (1) controlled-instrumental subtype (purposeful or goal-oriented); and (2) reactive-impulsive subtype (often elicits uncontrollable actions that are inappropriate or undesirable). Aggression differs from what is commonly called assertiveness, although the terms are often used interchangeably among laypeople (as in phrases such as "an aggressive salesperson").
