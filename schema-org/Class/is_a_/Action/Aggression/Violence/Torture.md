## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Torture** is the deliberate infliction of severe pain or suffering on a person 
> for reasons including punishment, extracting a confession, 
> interrogation for information, or intimidating third parties.
>
> Some definitions restrict torture to acts carried out by the state, 
> while others include non-state actors. 
> 
> Most victims of torture are poor and marginalized people suspected of crimes, 
> although torture against political prisoners, or during armed conflict, 
> has received disproportionate attention. 
> 
> Judicial corporal punishment and capital punishment 
> are sometimes seen as forms of torture, but this label is internationally controversial. 
> 
> A variety of methods of torture are used, often in combination; 
> the most common form of physical torture is beatings. 
> Beginning in the twentieth century, many torturers have 
> preferred non-scarring or psychological methods to maintain deniability. 
>
> Torturers more commonly act out of fear, or due to limited resources, rather than sadism. 
> Although most torturers are thought to learn about torture techniques informally 
> and rarely receive explicit orders, they are enabled by 
> organizations that facilitate and encourage their behavior. 
> 
> Once a torture program begins, it usually escalates beyond what is intended initially 
> and often leads to involved agencies losing effectiveness. 
> Torture aims to break the victim's will, destroy their agency and personality, 
> and is cited as one of the most damaging experiences that a person can undergo. 
> Many victims suffer both physical damage—chronic pain is particularly common—
> and mental sequelae. 
> Although torture survivors have some of the highest rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, many are psychologically resilient. 
>
> Torture has been carried out since ancient times. 
> However, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, 
> many Western countries abolished the official use of torture in the judicial system, 
> although it continued to be used throughout the world. 
> 
> Public opinion research shows general opposition to torture. 
> It is prohibited under international law for all states under all circumstances 
> and is explicitly forbidden by several treaties. 
> 
> Opposition to torture stimulated the formation of the human rights movement 
> after World War II, and it continues to be an important human rights issue. 
> 
> Although prevention efforts have been of mixed effectiveness, 
> institutional reforms and the elimination of incommunicado detention 
> have had positive effects. 
> 
> Despite its decline, torture is still practiced in or by most countries.
