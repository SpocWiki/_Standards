|   3 |      | MD5-Hash of namespace and a name                                                              |

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 
> A Universally Unique Identifier (**UUID**) is a 128-bit label 
> used for information in computer systems. 
> The term Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is also used, mostly in Microsoft systems.
> 
> When generated according to the standard methods, 
> UUIDs are, for practical purposes, unique. 
> 
> Their uniqueness does not depend on a __central registration authority__ 
> or __coordination__ between the parties generating them, 
> unlike most other numbering schemes. 
> 
> While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, 
> it is generally considered close enough to zero to be negligible.
> 
> Thus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something 
> with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, 
> or will be, created to identify something else. 
> 
> Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties 
> can therefore be later combined into a single database 
> or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.
>
> Adoption of UUIDs is widespread, 
> with many computing platforms providing support for generating them 
> and for parsing their textual representation.
