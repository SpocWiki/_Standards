Class of all URLs.
URLs are variable-length Strings that are used 
to uniquely name and also address Resources on the Internet. 
Similar to [[UUID]] 

> A Uniform Resource Locator (**URL**), 
> colloquially known as an address on the Web, 
> is a reference to a resource 
> that specifies its location on a computer network 
> and a mechanism for retrieving it. 
> 
> A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), 
> although many people use the two terms interchangeably. 
> 
> URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (HTTP/HTTPS) 
> but are also used for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), 
> database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
>
> Most web browsers display the URL of a web page 
> above the page in an address bar. 
> 
> A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, 
> which indicates a protocol (http), 
> a hostname (www.example.com), 
> and a file Path with name (index.html).
