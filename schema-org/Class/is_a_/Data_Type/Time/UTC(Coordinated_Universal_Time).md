> Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the **primary time standard** 
> globally used to regulate clocks and time. 
> 
> It establishes a contiguous reference for the current time, forming the basis for civil time and time zones. 
> UTC facilitates international communication, navigation, scientific research, and commerce.
>
> UTC has been widely embraced by most countries 
> and is the effective successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 
> 
> In specialised domains such as scientific research, navigation, and timekeeping, 
> other standards such as UT1 and International Atomic Time (TAI) are also used alongside UTC.
>
> UTC is based on TAI (International Atomic Time, abbreviated from its French name, temps atomique international), which is a **weighted average of hundreds of atomic clocks** worldwide. 
> UTC is **kept within about one second of mean solar time at 0Â° longitude** using leap Seconds, 
> the currently used prime meridian, and is **not adjusted for daylight saving time**.
>
> The coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 January 1960. UTC was first officially adopted as a standard in 1963 and "UTC" became the official abbreviation of Coordinated Universal Time in 1967. The current version of UTC is defined by the International Telecommunication Union.
>
> Since adoption, UTC has been adjusted several times, notably adding leap seconds starting in 1972. 
> Recent years have seen significant developments in the realm of UTC, 
> particularly in discussions about eliminating leap seconds from the timekeeping system 
> because leap seconds occasionally disrupt timekeeping systems worldwide. 
> 
> The General Conference on Weights and Measures adopted a resolution 
> to alter UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds by 2035.
