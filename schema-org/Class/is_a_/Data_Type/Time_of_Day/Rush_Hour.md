## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A rush hour (American English, British English) or peak hour (Australian English, Indian English) 
> is a part of the day during which traffic congestion on roads 
> and crowding on public transport is at its highest. 
> 
> Normally, this happens twice every weekday: once in the morning 
> and once in the afternoon or evening, the times during which most people commute. 
> 
> The term is often used for a period of peak congestion that may last for more than one hour.
>
> The term is very broad, but often refers specifically to private automobile transportation traffic, 
> even when there is a large volume of cars on a road but not many people, 
> or if the volume is normal but there is some disruption of speed. 
> 
> By analogy to vehicular traffic, the term Internet rush hour has been used 
> to describe periods of peak data network usage, 
> resulting in delays and slower delivery of data packets.
