## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Time** is the continuous progression of existence 
> that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession 
> from the past, through the present, and into the future. 
> 
> It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, 
> to compare the duration of events (or the intervals between them), 
> and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. 
> Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.
>
> Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the 
> International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities. 
> 
> The SI base unit of time is the second, which is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms. 
> 
> General relativity is the primary framework for understanding 
> how spacetime works. 
> 
> Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes.
>
> Throughout history, time has been an important subject of study in 
> religion, philosophy, and science. 
> 
> Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, 
> and has been a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. 
> 
> Time is also of significant social importance, 
> having economic value ("time is money") as well as personal value, 
> due to an awareness of the limited time in each day ("carpe diem") 
> and in human life spans.
