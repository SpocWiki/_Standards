#is_a_/professional_service

Original definition: "provider of professional services."

The general [[ProfessionalService]] type for local businesses was deprecated due to confusion with [[Service]]. For reference, the types that it included were: [[Dentist]],
		[[AccountingService]], [[Attorney]], [[Notary]], as well as types for several kinds of [[HomeAndConstructionBusiness]]: [[Electrician]], [[GeneralContractor]],
		[[HousePainter]], [[Locksmith]], [[Plumber]], [[RoofingContractor]]. [[LegalService]] was introduced as a more inclusive supertype of [[Attorney]].
