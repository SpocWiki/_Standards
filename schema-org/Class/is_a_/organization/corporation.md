## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> A **Corporation** is an organization—usually a group of people or a company—
> authorized by the state to act as a single entity 
> (a legal entity recognized by private and public law as "born out of statute"; 
> a legal person in a legal context) and recognized as such in law for certain purposes. 
> 
> Early incorporated entities were established by charter 
> (i.e., by an ad hoc act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). 
> 
> Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. 
> Corporations come in many different types 
> but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered 
> based on two aspects: 
> whether they can issue stock, or whether they are formed to make a profit. 
> Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as aggregate 
> (the subject of this article) or 
> sole (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office of a single natural person).
>
> One of the attractive early advantages business corporations offered to their investors, 
> compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, 
> was limited liability. 
> Limited liability means that a passive shareholder in a corporation 
> will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, 
> or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party. 
> 
> Limited liability in a contract is uncontroversial, because the parties to the contract could have agreed to it and could agree to waive it by contract. 
> However, limited liability in tort remains controversial 
> because third parties do not agree to waive the right to pursue shareholders.  
> There is significant evidence that limited liability in tort may lead to 
> __excessive corporate risk taking__ and __more harm by corporations__ to third parties.
>
> Where local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, 
> corporations allowed to do so are referred to as stock corporations; 
> one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and 
> owners of stock are referred to as stockholders or shareholders. 
> 
> Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as non-stock corporations; 
> i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons 
> who have obtained membership in the corporation and 
> are referred to as a member of the corporation. 
> 
> Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by 
> whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as for-profit 
> and not-for-profit corporations, respectively.
>
> There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit 
> in that not-for-profit corporations are nearly always non-stock as well. 
> A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, 
> but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock. 
> 
> To simplify the explanation, whenever "stockholder" or "shareholder" is used 
> in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, 
> it is presumed to mean the same as "member" for a non-profit corporation 
> or for a profit, non-stock corporation. 
> Registered corporations have legal personality, recognized by local authorities and 
> their shares are owned by shareholders whose liability is generally limited to their investment.
>
> Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; 
> shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors 
> to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. 
> 
> In most circumstances, 
> a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. 
> Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise 
> having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company.
>
> In American English, the word corporation is most often used to describe large business corporations. 
> In British English and in the Commonwealth countries, 
> the term 'company' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity 
> while the word corporation encompasses all incorporated entities. 
> 
> In American English, the word company can include entities such as partnerships 
> that would not be referred to as companies in British English 
> as they are not a separate legal entity. 
> Late in the 19th century, a new form of the company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. 
> While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive 
> as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. 
> 
> In Germany, such an organization is known as a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, or GmbH. 
> In the last quarter of the 20th century, 
> this new type form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States 
> and other countries, where it is called a limited liability company, or LLC. 
> GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations 
> (even though they have many of the same features).
