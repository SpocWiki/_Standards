Class of all proteins.

#is_a_/protein

[ #is_/part_of :: https://pending.schema.org ]

Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. 
Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) 
or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type schema:Protein. 

A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. schema:Protein 
as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be schema:Protein. 
They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Protein**s are large biomolecules and macromolecules 
> that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. 
> 
> Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, 
> DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, 
> and transporting molecules from one location to another. 
> 
> Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, 
> which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, 
> and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.
>
> A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. 
> A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. 
> Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins 
> and are commonly called peptides. 
> The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. 
> The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, 
> which is encoded in the genetic code. 
> In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; 
> but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine 
> and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. 
> 
> Shortly after or even during synthesis, 
> the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, 
> which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, 
> and ultimately, the function of the proteins. 
> Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. 
> Proteins can work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.
>
> Once formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded 
> and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. 
> 
> A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. 
> They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. 
> Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly 
> either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.
>
> Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, 
> proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. 
> Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. 
> Some proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle, 
> and the cytoskeleton's scaffolding proteins that maintain cell shape. 
> Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. 
> In animals, proteins are needed in the diet 
> to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. 
> Digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use.
