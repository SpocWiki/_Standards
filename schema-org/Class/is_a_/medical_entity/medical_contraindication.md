#is_a_/medical_contraindication

A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical therapy. Contraindications can be absolute (there are no reasonable circumstances for undertaking a course of action) or relative (the patient is at higher risk of complications, but these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or mitigated by other measures).
