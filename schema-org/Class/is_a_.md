Use this Relation to specify a [[../Class]] for Any-[[Thing]] like this: 
#is_a_ :: [[../Relation]] 

The Name is motivated from the [[TRTL]]-Language which abbreviates the [[../../W3C/RDF(Resource_Description_Framework)/RDF~Relations/rdf~type|rdf~type]] Relation with "is a" because it is so common. 
This is also equivalent to the [[is_instance_of|typeof]] Relation.
