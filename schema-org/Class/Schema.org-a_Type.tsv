CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class=""localLink"" href=""/ItemList"">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as TV, radio and games).<br/><br/>

Specific subtypes are available for describing <a class=""localLink"" href=""/TVSeries"">TVSeries</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/RadioSeries"">RadioSeries</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/MovieSeries"">MovieSeries</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/BookSeries"">BookSeries</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Periodical"">Periodical</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/VideoGameSeries"">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/hasPart"">hasPart</a> / <a class=""localLink"" href=""/isPartOf"">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>

It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate."

 news articles which are the result of journalistic news reporting conventions.<br/><br/>

In practice many news publishers produce a wide variety of article types, many of which might be considered a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/NewsArticle"">NewsArticle</a> but not a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a>. For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.<br/><br/>

The <a class=""localLink"" href=""/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> type is based on a stricter ideal for ""news"" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/ReportageNewsArticle"">ReportageNewsArticle</a> sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.<br/><br/>

      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a
      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,
      local government.<br/><br/>

For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#"">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>

The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic"">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org
expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our
usual <a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490"">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#"">this document</a>.<br/><br/>

While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol"">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover
the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>

Several kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>

We encourage the provision of ""name"", ""text"", ""datePosted"", ""expires"" (if appropriate), ""category"" 
and ""url"" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for ""category"" where possible, most ideally as a well known
URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be ""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic"" or ""https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910"".<br/><br/>

For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/WebContent"">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple ""<a class=""localLink"" href=""/text"">text</a>"" summary of the page. It is
unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>

We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/openingHours"">openingHours</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Event"">Event</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/FAQPage"">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/category"">category</a> property of the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>

Many <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class=""localLink"" href=""/LocalBusiness"">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/CivicStructure"">CivicStructure</a>s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>

The <a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a> only
for representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Course"">Course</a> or a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/RadioStation"">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/announcementLocation"">announcementLocation</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/spatialCoverage"">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of <a class=""localLink"" href=""/about"">about</a> for locations too.<br/><br/>

The basic content of <a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"">RSS</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)"">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting
<a class=""localLink"" href=""/SpecialAnnouncement"">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed
with the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/webFeed"">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class=""localLink"" href=""/DataFeed"">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class=""localLink"" href=""/encodingFormat"">encodingFormat</a> providing
media type information, e.g. ""application/rss+xml"" or ""application/atom+xml""."

The properties <a class=""localLink"" href=""/numConstraints"">numConstraints</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/constrainingProperty"">constrainingProperty</a> are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of ""population"" used here is the general sense of a statistical
population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a <a class=""localLink"" href=""/populationType"">populationType</a> of <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Event"">Event</a> or <a class=""localLink"" href=""/NewsArticle"">NewsArticle</a> could be used.

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).
