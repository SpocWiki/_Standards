Predicate to describe the Text of BroadcastChannel.

Use it like this: 
- has_id_broadcast_channel = `=this.dv_has_id_broadcast_channel`  
- has_id_broadcast_channel = `=this.dv_has_id_broadcast_channel`  

The unique address by which the BroadcastService can be identified in a provider lineup. In US, this is typically a number.

Predicated describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
