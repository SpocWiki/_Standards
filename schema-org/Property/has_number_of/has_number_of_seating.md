Predicate to describe the Number of Vehicle.

is_part_of = `=this.dv_is_part_of` 

Use it like this: 
- #has_/number_of_/seating_capacity : : Number, QuantitativeValue   
- has_number_of_seating : : Number, QuantitativeValue   

The number of persons that can be seated (e.g. in a vehicle), 
both in terms of the physical space available, and in terms of limitations set by law.

Typical unit code(s): C62 for persons

Predicate describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 
has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
