[[../../Predicate|Predicate]] to describe the relative Quality of a [[../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization/Business/Local_Business/Food_Establishment|FoodEstablishment]], [[../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization/Business/Local_Business/Lodging_Business|LodgingBusiness]]  etc.

is_similar_to = `=this.dv_is_similar_to` 

On e-commerce websites, a five-star rating system is often used, 
where a higher number of stars typically indicates a better product or service. 
The interpretation of each star can vary, but a general understanding is:

- 5 stars: 90% Excellent
- 4 stars: 70% Good
- 3 stars: 50% Average
- 2 stars: 30% Poor
- 1 star:  10% Very poor

The Rating can be mapped to an equivalent linear scale (although the Distribution is often Gaussian) using 20* Stars - 10%

Use it like this: 
- has_number_of_stars_rating = `=this.dv_has_number_of_stars_rating` ] ] 
- has_number_of_stars_rating = `=this.dv_has_number_of_stars_rating` ] ] 

An official rating for a lodging business or food establishment, e.g. from national associations or standards bodies. 

Use the [[../../Relation/has/has_author|has_author]] property to indicate the rating [[../../../Society/Agent|Agent]], [[../../../Society/Agent/Person|Person]] or [[../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization|Organization]], 
e.g. as an Organization with name such as (e.g. HOTREC, DEHOGA, WHR, or Hotelstars).

Predicate describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
