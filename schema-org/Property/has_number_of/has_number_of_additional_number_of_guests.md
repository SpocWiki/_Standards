- has_number_of_additional_guests = `=this.dv_has_number_of_additional_guests`  
- has_number_of_additional_guests = `=this.dv_has_number_of_additional_guests`  

If responding yes, the number of guests who will attend in addition to the invitee.

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
