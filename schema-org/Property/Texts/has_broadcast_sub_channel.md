Predicate to describe the Text of BroadcastFrequencySpecification.

is_part_of = `=this.dv_is_part_of` 

Use it like this: 
- has_text_of_broadcast_sub_channel = `=this.dv_has_text_of_broadcast_sub_channel`  
- has_text_of_broadcast_sub_channel = `=this.dv_has_text_of_broadcast_sub_channel`  

The subchannel used for the broadcast.

Predicated describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
