> A **Tablet** (also known as a pill) is a pharmaceutical oral dosage form 
> (oral solid dosage, or OSD) or solid unit dosage form. 
> 
> Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medication with suitable excipients. 
> It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, 
> that are pressed or compacted into a solid dose. 
> 
> The main advantages of tablets are that they ensure a consistent dose of medicine that is easy to consume. 
>
> Tablets are prepared either by moulding or by compression.  
> The excipients can include diluents, binders or granulating agents, glidants (flow aids) 
> and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to promote tablet break-up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to enhance taste; and pigments to make the tablets visually attractive or aid in visual identification of an unknown tablet. A polymer coating is often applied to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, to control the release rate of the active ingredient, to make it more resistant to the environment (extending its shelf life), or to enhance the tablet's appearance. 
>
> Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever colour their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colours to help distinguish different medicines. Tablets are often imprinted with symbols, letters, and numbers, which allow them to be identified, or a groove to allow splitting by hand. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimetres to about a centimetre.
>
> The compressed tablet is the most commonly seen dosage form in use today. About two-thirds of all prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site in the body; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered sublingually, buccally, rectally or intravaginally. The tablet is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as syrups, elixirs, suspensions, and emulsions.
