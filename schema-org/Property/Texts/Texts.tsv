The general trend in web technology is towards <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design"">responsive design</a> in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established <a class=""localLink"" href=""/url"">url</a> property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all <a class=""localLink"" href=""/url"">url</a> markup to use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/mobileUrl"">mobileUrl</a> for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Product"">Product</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Offer"">Offer</a>) have extra URLs hosted on an additional ""mobile site"" alongside the main one.

For example, the motion picture known as ""Ghostbusters"" whose <a class=""localLink"" href=""/titleEIDR"">titleEIDR</a> is ""10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J"" has several edits, e.g. ""10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I"" and ""10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3"".<br/><br/>

Since schema.org types like <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Movie"">Movie</a> and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/TVEpisode"">TVEpisode</a> can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use <a class=""localLink"" href=""/titleEIDR"">titleEIDR</a> alone (for a general description), or alongside <a class=""localLink"" href=""/editEIDR"">editEIDR</a> for a more edit-specific description."

GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.<br/><br/>

The GS1 <a href=""https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/"">digital link specifications</a> express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also <a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809"">schema.org tracking issue</a> for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin"">gtin</a> value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a ""GS1 Digital Link"" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a <a href=""https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator"">valid GS1 check digit</a> and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also <a href=""http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin"">GS1's GTIN Summary</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number"">Wikipedia</a> for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin"">gtin</a> property generalizes the earlier <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin8"">gtin8</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin12"">gtin12</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin13"">gtin13</a>, and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin14"">gtin14</a> properties.<br/><br/>

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details."
