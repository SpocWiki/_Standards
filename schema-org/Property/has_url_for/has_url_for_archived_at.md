Predicate to specify the Url of CreativeWork.

is_part_of = `=this.dv_is_part_of` 

Use it like this: 
- has_url_for_archived_at = `=this.dv_has_url_for_archived_at`  
- has_url_for_archived_at = `=this.dv_has_url_for_archived_at`  

Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content.

Predicate describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
