Predicate to specify the Url of CreativeWork.

#is_/part_of :: pending:  

Use it like this: 
- #has_/url_for_/archived_at :: URL, WebPage   
- #has_url_for_archived_at :: URL, WebPage   

Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content.

Predicate describes that: 

#has_/domain  :: CreativeWork  

(has_/name :: has_url_for_archived_at )
(has_/range :: URL, WebPage )
