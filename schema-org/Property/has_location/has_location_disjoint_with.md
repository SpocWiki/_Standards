Predicate to describe the geo of GeospatialGeometry, Place.

Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/location_/disjoint_with :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] or 
- [ has_location_disjoint_with :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] 

Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) are topologically disjoint: 

"they have no point in common. They form a set of disconnected geometries." 
(A symmetric relationship, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM)) 

Predicate describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ]
( #has_/name :: has_location_disjoint )
( #has_/range :: GeospatialGeometry, Place )
