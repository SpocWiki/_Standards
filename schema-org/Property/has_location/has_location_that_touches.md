Symmetric relation between 2 neighboring, non-overlapping GeospatialGeometry or Place.

Use it like this: 
- #has_/location_that_touches = `=this.dv_has_location_that_touches`  
- has_location_that_touches = `=this.dv_has_location_that_touches`  

Represents spatial relations in which two geometries (or the places they represent) touch: 
"they have at least one boundary point in common, more commonly a boundary line, but no interior points." 

(A symmetric relationship, as defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM).)

Predicate describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
