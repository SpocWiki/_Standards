Symmetric Relation of two overlapping [[../../Class/is_a_/Intangible/geospatial_geometry|GeospatialGeometries]] or [[../../../Earth/Geography/Place|places]].

Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/location_/overlap_with :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] or 
- [ has_location_that_overlaps_with :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] 

Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that geospatially overlaps it, i.e. they have some but not all points in common. As defined in [DE-9IM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM). 

Predicate describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ]
( #has_/name :: has_location_that_overlaps_with )
( #has_/range :: GeospatialGeometry, Place )


[[../../../schema-org|schema-org]] also defines the largely equivalent Relations
	- `GeoIntersects` and 
	- `GeoCrosses`
but these are too granular and create unnecessary Redundancy.
