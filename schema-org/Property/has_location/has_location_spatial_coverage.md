Predicate to describe the geo of CreativeWork.

Use it like this: 
- #has_/location_/spatial_coverage :: Place   
- has_location_spatial_coverage :: Place   

The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
	  contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
	  areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.

Predicate describes that: 

#has_/domain  :: CreativeWork  

(has_/name :: has_location_spatial_coverage )
(has_/range :: Place )

#has_/parent_/property  :: contentLocation  

#has_/sub_properties :: [ announcementLocation, legislationJurisdiction ]
