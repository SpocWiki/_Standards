Predicate to describe the geo of CreativeWork.

Use it like this: 
- #has_/location_/spatial_coverage : : Place   
- has_location_spatial_coverage : : Place   

The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
	  contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
	  areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.

Predicate describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range` 

has_parent_property = `=this.dv_has_parent_property` 

has_child_property = `=this.dv_has_child_property`
