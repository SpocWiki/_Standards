Predicate to describe the Quantity of Vehicle.

#is_/part_of :: https://auto.schema.org  

Use it like this: 
- #has_/value_for_/speed_km_h :: QuantitativeValue   
- #has_value_for_speed_km_h :: QuantitativeValue   

The speed range of the vehicle. If the vehicle is powered by an engine, the upper limit of the speed range (indicated by [[maxValue]]) should be the maximum speed achievable under regular conditions.



Typical unit code(s): KMH for km/h, HM for mile per hour (0.447 04 m/s), KNT for knot



*Note 1: Use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate the range. Typically, the minimal value is zero.
* Note 2: There are many different ways of measuring the speed range. You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property.

Predicate describes that: 

#has_/domain  :: Vehicle  

(has_/name :: has_value_for_speed_km_h )
(has_/range :: QuantitativeValue )
