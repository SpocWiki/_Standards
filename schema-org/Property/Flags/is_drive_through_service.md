Indicates whether some facility (e.g. [[../../../Society/Agent/Organization/Business/Local_Business/Food_Establishment]], [[../../../Society/Agent/Organization/Business/Local_Business/Medical_Business/Medical_Clinic/Covid_Testing_Facility]]) 
offers a service that can be used by driving through in a car. 

In the case of [[../../../Society/Agent/Organization/Business/Local_Business/Medical_Business/Medical_Clinic/Covid_Testing_Facility]] 
such facilities could potentially help with social distancing from other potentially-infected users.

Renamed from `hasDriveThroughService`, because it is a boolean Type.
