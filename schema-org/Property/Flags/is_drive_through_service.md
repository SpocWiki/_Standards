Indicates whether some facility (e.g. [[Food_Establishment]], [[Covid_Testing_Facility]]) 
offers a service that can be used by driving through in a car. 

In the case of [[Covid_Testing_Facility]] 
such facilities could potentially help with social distancing from other potentially-infected users.
