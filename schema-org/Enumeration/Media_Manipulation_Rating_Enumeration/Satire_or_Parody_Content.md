## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Satire** is a genre of the visual,  literary, and performing arts, usually in the form of fiction 
> and less frequently non-fiction, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up 
> to ridicule, often with the intent of exposing or shaming the perceived flaws of individuals, 
> corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. 
> 
> Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, 
> its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, 
> using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. 
> 
> Satire may also poke fun at popular themes in art and film.
>
> A prominent feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm—
> "in satire, irony is militant", according to literary critic Northrop Frye— 
> but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre 
> are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. 
> This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of 
> (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to question.
>
> Satire is found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, 
> literature, plays, commentary, music, film and television shows, and media such as lyrics.
