# [[Now]]

Most Programming Languages have an impure Function named Now, 
which yields the current Date and Time in a fixed Resolution/[[../Science/Physics/Measurement/Precision]]. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The **Present** is the period of time that is occurring right now. The present is in contrast to the past, the period of time that has already occurred; and the future, the period of time that has yet to occur.
>
> It is sometimes represented as a hyperplane in space-time, typically called "now", although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion. The present may also be viewed as a duration.
