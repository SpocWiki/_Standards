# [[Proposition]] 
#is_a_/class  .

Proposition/Claims are the smallest possible Statements in Predicate Logic. 
They are the Building-Blocks of the Semantic Web.
Claims can be 'reified' to make Propositions about Propositions.

Propositions consist of 3 Parts forming a so-called Triple: 
- [[Relation/is/is_subject_of|subjectOf]]
- Predicate
- [[Relation/has/has_object|object]] or Value 

The S-P-O order makes for a nice Reading of Propositions in English.

In Obsidian, the canonical Subject is the current Document. 
Predicates take the form of Verbs or Relations. 

Predicate and Object/Value are sometimes combined into boolean Tags, 
which are natively supported in Obsidian using the # (Hash) Tag-Notation known e.g. from Twitter. 

Tags are problematic though because of their proliferation and missing implicit Semantic. 

Other Document Formats like [[TRTL]] (AKA Turtle) allow to specify Triples directly 
with a formal, but surprisingly readable Syntax similar to natural Language. 

An important Attribute of a Statement is its Factuality, i.e. its Level of 'Truth' measured by experiments with the real world.
Basic Levels of Factuality are 
- Proof 
- Evidence 
- Assumption 
- Question 

> A claim is a statement that one subject, such as a person or organization, makes about a subject. A claim is a debatable statement that an author manifests in a text or theoretical construction, so that the reader accepts it, something that not everyone will accept. 
>
> An objective claim is a statement about a factual matter-one that can be proved true or false.  A subjective claim is not a factual matter; it is an expression of belief, opinion, or personal preference, and can not be proved right or wrong by any generally accepted criteria.
