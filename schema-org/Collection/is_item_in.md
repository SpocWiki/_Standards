# [Collection](../Collection.md) - [[Item]] Relationship, 
in which the aggregated object represents a container. 

For example, a postal package can include different contents 
such as a book, a bottle of wine, and a birthday card. 

These [Collection](../Collection.md) - [Item](Item.md)s are 
- usually generic, but sometimes they are untyped (i.e. `Object`), 
- less uniform than [Instances](../Class/Thing.md), which are [instances_of](../Class/is_instance_of.md) of a [Classes](../../Classes.md) 
- and not as tightly coupled as the [Parts](../Composite/Part.md) that are [parts_of](../Composite/is_part_of.md) a [Composite](../Composite.md)  relationship. 

#is_/inverse_of :: [[has_items]] 

The collection provides functionality, such as iterating over its members
and performing operations on each of them. 

When all Items have the same Type, this may also be called Organization-Member. 

The contents may often be dynamically added to or removed from. 

#class/Relation  

Use it like this: 
- [ #is_/element_of :: Collection] or 
- [ is_element_of :: Collection] 

Relates an Element to its Set. 
Can be implemented with dedicated boolean #Tags for each Set 

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Thing]
( #has_/name :: is_element_of)
( #has_/range :: Collection)
