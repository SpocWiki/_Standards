# [[Homogeneous_Relation]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a **homogeneous relation** (also called endorelation) on a set X 
> is a binary relation between X and itself, i.e. it is a subset of the Cartesian product X × X. 
> 
> This is commonly phrased as "a relation on X" or "a (binary) relation over X". 
> An example of a homogeneous relation is the relation of kinship, where the relation is between people.
>
> Common types of endorelations include orders, graphs, and equivalences. 
> 
> Specialized studies of order theory and graph theory have developed understanding of endorelations. 
> 
> Terminology particular for graph theory is used for description, 
> with an ordinary (undirected) graph presumed to correspond to a symmetric relation, 
> and a general endorelation corresponding to a directed graph. 
> 
> An endorelation R corresponds to a logical square adjacency matrix of 0s and 1s, (in graph terminology)
> where the expression xRy (x is R-related to y) corresponds to an edge between x and y in the graph, 
> and to a 1 in the square matrix of R.
