> In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 
> 
> The equipollence relation between line segments in geometry is a common example of an equivalence relation. 
> A simpler example is numerical equality. 
> - Any number a is equal to itself (reflexive). 
> - If a=b , then b=a (symmetric). 
> - If  a=b and b=x, then a=c (transitive).
>
> Each equivalence relation provides a partition of the underlying set into disjoint equivalence classes. 
> Two elements of the given set are equivalent to each other 
> if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class.
