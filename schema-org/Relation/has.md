The Prefix `has_` makes Predicates much more readable. 
For the same Relation, sometimes both a Relation and a Property are available, 
when the Subject is a Scalar: 

## #has_/examples 

#see [[has/has_lyrics|has_lyrics]]: 

You can use it like this when the Lyrics need to be referenced from multiple places: 
- [ #has_/lyrics  :: CreativeWork ]  
- [ has_lyrics :: CreativeWork ] 

or, when giving the text directly: 
- [ #has_/text_of_/lyrics  :: Text ]
