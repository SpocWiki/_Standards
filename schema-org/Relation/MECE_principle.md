> The MECE principle (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) 
> is a grouping principle for separating a set of items into subsets that are 
> - mutually exclusive (ME) and 
> - collectively exhaustive (CE). 
> 
> It was developed in the late 1960s by Barbara Minto at McKinsey & Company 
> and underlies her Minto Pyramid Principle, and while she takes credit for MECE, 
> according to her interview with McKinsey, she says 
> the idea for MECE goes back as far as to Aristotle.
> 
> The MECE principle has been used in the business mapping process wherein 
> the optimum arrangement of information is exhaustive 
> and does not double count at any level of the hierarchy. 
> 
> Examples of MECE arrangements include categorizing 
> - people by year of birth (assuming all years are known), 
> - apartments by their building number, 
> - letters by postmark, and dice rolls. 
> 
> A non-MECE example would be categorization by nationality, 
> because nationalities are neither mutually exclusive (some people have dual nationality) 
> nor collectively exhaustive (some people have none).
