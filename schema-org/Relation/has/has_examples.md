Inverse Relation to [[../../../W3C/RDF(Resource_Description_Framework)/RDF~Relations/rdf~type|rdf~type]] and [[../../Class/is_instance_of|is_instance_of]] . 

Enumerating Examples is rarely exact or exhaustive, 
but very helpful for Humans to illustrate a Concept with already known Instances. 
Plural Form chosen to indicate the [[../../Collection]]-Nature. 

Therefore this partially(incomplete) inverse Relation is included in the non-standard more generic [[has_examples]] Relation. 

Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/examples :: [[../../Collection]] ] or 
- [ has_examples :: [[../../Collection]]] 

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: [[../../Class|Class]] ]
( #has_/name :: [[has_examples]] )
( #has_/range :: [[../../Collection]] )

[ #is_/inverse_of  :: [[../../Class/is_instance_of]] ]

[ #has_/sub_properties :: [ [[has_work_example]] ] ]
