is_a = `=this.dv_is_a` 
#is_a_/relation 
#class/Relation

- #has_/education_/alignment = `=this.dv_has_education_alignment`  
- has_education_alignment = `=this.dv_has_education_alignment`  

An alignment to an established educational framework.



This property should **not be used** 
where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, 
for example to express that a resource [[teaches]] or [[assesses]] a competency.

Relation describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 
has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
