Use it like this: 
- #has_/broadcast_frequency = `=this.dv_has_broadcast_frequency`  
- has_broadcast_frequency = `=this.dv_has_broadcast_frequency`  

The frequency used for over-the-air broadcasts. Numeric values or simple ranges, e.g. 87-99. In addition a shortcut idiom is supported for frequences of AM and FM radio channels, e.g. "87 FM".

Relation describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 
has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
