Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/broadcast_frequency :: BroadcastFrequencySpecification, Text ] or 
- [ has_broadcast_frequency :: BroadcastFrequencySpecification, Text ] 

The frequency used for over-the-air broadcasts. Numeric values or simple ranges, e.g. 87-99. In addition a shortcut idiom is supported for frequences of AM and FM radio channels, e.g. "87 FM".

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: BroadcastChannel, BroadcastService ]
( #has_/name :: has_broadcast_frequency )
( #has_/range :: BroadcastFrequencySpecification, Text )
