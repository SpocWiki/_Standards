Use it like this: 
- #has_/included_composition = `=this.dv_has_included_composition`  
- has_included_composition = `=this.dv_has_included_composition`  

Smaller compositions included in this work (e.g. a movement in a symphony).

Relation describes that: 

has_domain = `=this.dv_has_domain` 

has_name = `=this.dv_has_name` 
has_range = `=this.dv_has_range`
