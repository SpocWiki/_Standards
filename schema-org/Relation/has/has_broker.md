Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/broker :: Organization, Person ] or 
- [ has_broker :: Organization, Person ] 

An entity that arranges for an exchange between a buyer and a seller.  

In most cases a broker never acquires or releases ownership of a product or service involved in an exchange. 

If it is not clear whether an entity is a broker, seller, or buyer, the latter two terms are preferred.

This `supersedes` the Term `bookingAgent`. 

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Invoice, Order, Reservation, Service ]
( #has_/name :: has_broker )
( #has_/range :: Organization, Person )
