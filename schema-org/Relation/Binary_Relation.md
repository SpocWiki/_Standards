> In mathematics, a **binary relation** associates some elements of one set called the domain with some  elements of another set (possibly the same) called the codomain. Precisely, a binary relation over sets X and Y 
> is a set of  ordered pairs (x,y), where 
>  x is an element of X
>  and 
>  y is an element of Y 
> 
> It encodes the common concept of relation: 
> an element x is related to an element y, 
> if and only if the pair (x,y) belongs to the set of ordered pairs that defines the binary relation.

> An example of a binary relation is the "divides" relation over the set of prime numbers P 
>  and the set of integers Z
> , in which each prime p is related to each integer z
>  that is a multiple of p
> , but not to an integer that is not a multiple of p

> In this relation, for instance,

> - the "is congruent to" relation in geometry;
> - the "is adjacent to" relation in graph theory;
> - the "is orthogonal to" relation in linear algebra.

> A function may be defined as a binary relation with the additional constraint that each x appears at most once. 
> Binary relations are also heavily used in computer science.

> A binary relation over sets X and Y can be identified with

>  Since a powerset is a lattice for set inclusion (⊆), 
>  relations can be manipulated using set operations (union, intersection, and complementation) and algebra of sets.

> In some systems of axiomatic set theory, relations are extended to classes, which are generalizations of sets. 
> This extension is needed for, among other things, 
> modeling the concepts of "is an element of" or "is a subset of" in set theory,
