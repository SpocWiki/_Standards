# [[has_complement]]

#is_/similar_to :: [[WD~opposite of,P461]]

alias: is opposite of 

Use it like this: 
- [has_/complement :: Property] 
- [ has_complement :: Property] 

In lack of a better term this is often used to relate 
disjoint/mutually exclusive, but not necessarily exhaustive Categories as Complements do. 
The Union of multiple Complements form a Universe 
with Partitions following the [[MECE_principle]]. 

Complementary Relations are e.g. Order Relations. 
They relate exactly those pairs of items to each other, 
that the original Relation does NOT relate.

Don't confuse that with the [[has_inverse|inverse_of]] Relation 
where A->Relates->B <=> B->Inverse->A.

Sometimes this is also named "Negative_of", "Negation_of" or "negated".

The Union of any Relation with its Complement is the (trivial) universal Relation, 
which relates everything to everything. 

E.g. [[is/is_less_than]] and [[is/is_greater_than]], 
where an Attribute of one Relation negates the Truth/Existence of the negated Relation. 

Relation `>` has the same Domain for both Arguments which makes it more confusing. 
- Its Complement is `<=`. 
- Its Converse is `<`. 
- It has no Inverse, because it is not a Function. 

Relation describes that: 

#has_/domain  :: Property 

(has_/name :: has_complement)
(has_/range :: Property)
