Boolean Relation to express the relative Fitness of the Object compared to the Subject. 

There is no standard-Relation because the Purpose of this Relation is implicit, not explicit. 
Prefer quantitative Attributes like [[../../Class/is_a_/Intangible/rating|Rating]]  or one of its more specific derivatives which uses an absolute Scale, not a relative and is therefore universally comparable. 

#is_/inverse_of :: [[is_better_than]] 

Use it like this: 
#is_/worse_than :: [[../../Property/has_value_for/has_value_for_rating|has_value_for_rating]]
