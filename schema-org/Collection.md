# [[Collection]]
#is_a_/class  . 
#class/Collection is the Base-Class of all (mutable, finite, at most countable) collections with untyped [Items](../../../Collection/Item.md).
It is the Object of the [[Collection/is_item_in|is_item_in]] Relation from the [[Collection/Item|Item]] to the  [[Collection]]

A collection of items, e.g. creative works or products.

The collection provides functionality, such as iterating over its members
and performing operations on each of them. 

Collections are usually finite and often untyped. 

They can be at most countable, but to allow for Mathematical Induction, 
they also need to be finitely typed (to allow a finite switch-Statement).
