## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Europe** is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere 
> and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. 
> It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, 
> the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. 
> 
> Europe shares the landmass of Eurasia with Asia, 
> and of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa. 
> 
> Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia 
> by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, 
> the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterway of the Bosporus Strait.
> 
> Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), 
> or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), 
> making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). 
> 
> Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, 
> of which Russia is the largest and most populous, 
> spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. 
> 
> Europe had a total population of about 745 million 
> (about 10% of the world population) in 2021; 
> the third-largest after Asia and Africa. 
> 
> The European climate is affected by warm Atlantic currents, 
> such as the Gulf Stream, which produce a temperate climate, 
> tempering winters and summers, on much of the continent. 
> Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable 
> producing more continental climates.
>
> European culture consists of a range of national and regional cultures, 
> which form the central roots of the wider Western civilization, 
> and together commonly reference ancient Greece and ancient Rome, 
> particularly through their Christian successors, as crucial and shared roots. 
> 
> Beginning with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, 
> Christian consolidation of Europe in the wake of the Migration Period 
> marked the European post-classical Middle Ages. 
> 
> The Italian Renaissance, radiating from Florence, 
> spread to the rest of the continent a new humanist interest in art and science 
> which led to the modern era. 
> 
> Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, 
> Europe played a predominant role in global affairs 
> with multiple explorations and conquests around the world.
>
> Between the 16th and 20th centuries, 
> European powers colonised at various times the Americas, 
> almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the majority of Asia.
>
> The Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars 
> shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically 
> from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. 
> 
> The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain 
> at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, 
> cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. 
> 
> Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, 
> contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs 
> by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States 
> took prominence and competed over dominance in Europe and globally. 
> 
> The resulting Cold War divided Europe along the Iron Curtain, 
> with NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East. 
> 
> This divide ended with the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
> and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 
> which allowed European integration to advance significantly.
>
> European integration is being advanced institutionally since 1948 
> with the founding of the Council of Europe, 
> and significantly through the realisation of the European Union (EU), 
> which represents today the majority of Europe. 
> 
> The European Union is a supranational political entity 
> that lies between a confederation and a federation 
> and is based on a system of European treaties. 
> 
> The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward 
> since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
> 
> A majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, 
> and participate in the European single market and a customs union. 
> 
> A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, 
> have also abolished internal border and immigration controls. 
> 
> Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; 
> they are considered to be the second-largest democratic elections in the world after India's. The EU is the third-largest economy in the world.
