#has_/time_/created :: 1985 

> The **Schengen Area** (English:  SHENG-ən, Luxembourgish: [ˈʃæŋən] ) 
> is an area encompassing 29 European countries 
> that have officially abolished border controls at their mutual borders. 
> 
> Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the  [[European_Union]], it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction 
> under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. 
> The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement 
> and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in [[Schengen]], Luxembourg.
>
> Of the 27 EU member states, 25 are part of the Schengen Area. 
> Bulgaria and Romania, the newest members having joined on 31 March 2024, 
> only have air and maritime borders open, 
> with land border controls remaining in place pending agreement to lift them.  
> 
> The only EU member states that are __not part of the Schengen Area are Cyprus and Ireland__. 
> Cyprus is legally obliged to join in the future, 
> while Ireland maintains an opt-out and operates its own visa policy. 
>
> In addition to the member states of the European Union, 
> all member states of the [[EFTA(European Free Trade Association)]],  
> namely Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, 
> have signed association agreements with the EU to be part of the Schengen Area. 
> Moreover, three microstates, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City, 
> are de facto members of the Schengen Area due to their size 
> and impossibility of maintaining active border controls.
>
> The Schengen Area has a population of more than 450 million people 
> and an area of 4,595,131 square kilometres (1,774,190 sq mi). 
> About 1.7 million people commute to work across an internal European border each day, 
> and in some regions these people constitute up to a third of the workforce. 
> In 2015, there were 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 
> Fifty-seven million crossings were due to transport of goods by road, 
> with a value of €2.8 trillion. 
> The decrease in the cost of trade due to Schengen varies from 0.42% to 1.59% 
> depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors. 
> Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit. 
> States in the Schengen Area have 
> strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries.
