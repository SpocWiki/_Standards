# [[Age~3~Meghalayan]] 

A time period from 4_200 thousand years ago to the present. 

> The **Meghalayan** age is the name given in 2018, by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, to the current age or latest geologic age â€“ or uppermost stage of the Quaternary. It is also the upper, or latest, of three subdivisions of the Holocene epoch or series. This way of breaking down time is based only on geology; for example, it is unrelated to the three-age system of historical periods into which human development is sometimes divided.

> The Meghalayan begins 4,200 years BP (c. 2251 BCE or 7750 HE), leaving room for the possible introduction of the Anthropocene. Helama & Oinonen (2019) dated the start of the Meghalayan to 2190-1990 BCE. The age began with a 200-year drought that impacted human civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yangtze River Valley. "The fact that the beginning of this age coincides with a cultural shift caused by a global climate event makes it unique," according to Stanley Finney, Secretary General of the International Union of Geological Sciences.
