# [[Epoch~3~Late_Ordovician]] 

A time period from 458.4 to 443.8 million years ago. 

> The Late Ordovician, also called the Upper Ordovician by geologists, is the third epoch of the Ordovician period. 
> At this time Western and Central Europe and North America collided to form Laurentia, while glaciers built up in Gondwana, which was positioned over the South Pole. This caused a drop in global temperatures, resulting in "ice house" conditions. 
> 
> For most of this time life continued to flourish, but at and near the end of the period there were mass-extinction events that seriously affected planktonic forms like conodonts, graptolites, and some groups of trilobites (Agnostida and Pytchopariida, which completely died out, and the Asaphida which were much reduced). 
> 
> Brachiopods, bryozoans and echinoderms were also heavily affected, and the endocerid cephalopods died out completely, except for possible rare Silurian forms. The Ordovician-Silurian Extinction Events may have been caused by an ice age that occurred at the end of the Ordovician period as the end of the Late Ordovician was __one of the coldest times in the last 600 million years of earth history__.
