# [[Epoch~3~Lopingian]] 

#is_a_/time_/Epoch 

A time period from 259.51 to 251.902 million years ago. 

> The **Lopingian** is the uppermost series/last epoch of the Permian. It is the last epoch of the Paleozoic. The Lopingian was preceded by the Guadalupian and followed by the Early Triassic.
>
> The Lopingian is often synonymous with the informal terms late Permian or upper Permian.
>
> The name was introduced by Amadeus William Grabau in 1931 and derives from Leping, Jiangxi in China. It consists of two stages/ages. The earlier is the Wuchiapingian and the later is the Changhsingian.The International Chronostratigraphic Chart (v2018/07) provides a numerical age of 259.1 ±0.5 Ma. If a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) has been approved, the lower boundary of the earliest stage determines numerical age of an epoch. The GSSP for the Wuchiapingian has a numerical age of 259.8 ± 0.4 Ma.Evidence from Milankovitch cycles suggests that the length of an Earth day during this epoch was approximately 22 hours.
