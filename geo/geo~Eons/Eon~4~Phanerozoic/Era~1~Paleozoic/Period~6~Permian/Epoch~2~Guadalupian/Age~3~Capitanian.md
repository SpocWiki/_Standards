# [[Age~3~Capitanian]] 

A time period from 264.28 to 259.51 million years ago. 

> In the geologic timescale, the **Capitanian** is an age or stage of the Permian. It is also the uppermost or latest of three subdivisions of the Guadalupian Epoch or Series. The Capitanian lasted between 264.28 and 259.51 million years ago. It was preceded by the [[Age~2~Wordian]] and followed by the [[../Epoch~3~Lopingian/Age~1~Wuchiapingian|Age~1~Wuchiapingian]]. 
> 
> A significant mass extinction event occurred at the end of this stage, which was associated with anoxia and acidification in the oceans and possibly caused by the volcanic eruptions that produced the Emeishan Traps. This extinction event may be related to the much larger Permian–Triassic extinction event that followed about 10 million years later.
