RDF-Schema is a simple Language to describe [[RDF~Classes/rdfs~Class|rdfs~Class]] and simple Relations. 
Many RDFS Definitions are included in the more expressive [[OWL(Ontology_Web_Language)]].

> RDF Schema (Resource Description Framework Schema, 
> variously abbreviated as RDFS, RDF(S), RDF-S, or RDF/S) 
> is a set of classes with certain properties 
> using the RDF extensible knowledge representation data model, 
> providing __basic__ elements for the description of __ontologies__. 
> 
> It uses various forms of RDF vocabularies, intended to structure RDF resources. 
> RDF and RDFS can be saved in a triplestore, 
> then one can extract some knowledge from them using a query language, like SPARQL.
