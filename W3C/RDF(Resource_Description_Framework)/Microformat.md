Microformat uses these Attributes, but is not used frequently:
- `class` :: [Classname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) 
- `rel` :: relationship, description of the target address in an anchor-element (`<a href=... rel=...>...</a>`) [[@rel]] 
- `rev` :: reverse relationship, description of the referenced document

Microformats use several pre-defined Vocabularies in Attributes, but only [[hCard]] and [[hCalendar]] have been ratified, the others remaining as drafts: 

> **Microformat**s (Î¼F) are a set of defined HTML classes created 
> to serve as consistent and descriptive metadata about an element, 
> designating it as representing a certain type of data 
> (such as contact information, geographic coordinates, events, blog posts, products, recipes, etc.). 
> 
> They allow software to process the information reliably 
> by having set classes refer to a specific type of data rather than being arbitrary. 
> 
> Microformats emerged around 2005 and were predominantly 
> designed for use by search engines, web syndication and aggregators such as RSS. 
> 
> Although the content of web pages has been capable of some "automated processing" since the inception of the web, 
> such processing is difficult because the markup elements 
> used to display information on the web 
> do not describe what the information means. 
> 
> Microformats can bridge this gap by attaching semantics, 
> and thereby obviating other, more complicated, methods of automated processing, 
> such as natural language processing or screen scraping. 
> 
> The use, adoption and processing of microformats enables data items to be indexed, 
> searched for, saved or cross-referenced, 
> so that information can be reused or combined.
> 
> As of 2013, microformats allow the encoding and extraction of event details, 
> contact information, social relationships and similar information.
>
> Microformats2 abbreviated as mf2 is the updated version of microformats. Mf2 provides a more easy way of interpreting HTML(hypertext Markup Language) structured syntax and vocabularies than the earlier ways that made use of RDFa and microdata.
