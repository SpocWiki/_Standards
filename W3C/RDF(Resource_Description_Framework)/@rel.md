Valid HTML rel=Attributes are [registered with IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations-1.csv)

|contents|Refers to a table of contents.|[[HTML 4.01 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/)]||
|convertedfrom|The document linked to was later converted to the document that contains this link relation. For example, an RFC can have a link to the Internet-Draft that became the RFC; in that case, the link relation would be "convertedFrom".|[[RFC7991](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc7991)]|This relation is different than "predecessor-version" in that "predecessor-version" is for items in a version control system.

There are no constraints on the format or representation of either A or B, neither are there any further constraints on either resource.|[[RFC6892](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6892)]|This link relation type is the inverse of the 'describedby' relation type. While 'describedby' establishes a relation from the described resource back to the resource that describes it, 'describes' established a relation from the describing resource to the resource it describes. If B is 'describedby' A, then A 'describes' B.|

See [[RFC6415](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc6415)] for information about processing this relation type in host-meta documents. When used elsewhere, it refers to additional links and other metadata.

Requested by Joshua Kinberg and Robert Sayre. It is meant as a general way to facilitate acts of payment, and thus this specification makes no assumptions on the type of payment or transaction protocol. Examples may include a web page where donations are accepted or where goods and services are available for purchase. rel="payment" is not intended to initiate an automated transaction. In Atom documents, a link element with a rel="payment" attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or the entry/item level.

|preload|Refers to a resource that should be loaded early in the processing of the link's context, without blocking rendering.|[[Preload](http://www.w3.org/TR/preload/)]|Additional target attributes establish the detailed fetch properties of the link.|

|related|Identifies a related resource.|[[RFC4287](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc4287)]||
