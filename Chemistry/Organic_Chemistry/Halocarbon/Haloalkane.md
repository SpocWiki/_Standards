> The **Haloalkane**s (also known as halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) 
> are alkanes containing one or more halogen substituents of hydrogen atom. 
> 
> They are a subset of the general class of [[../Halocarbon]]s, although the distinction is not often made. 
> Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. 
> 
> They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, 
> and pharmaceuticals. 
> 
> Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, 
> many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. 
> 
> For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. 
> Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. 
> 
> Only haloalkanes that contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, 
> but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. 
> 
> Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties 
> and the United States Environmental Protection Agency 
> has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. 
> 
> For more information, see Halomethane. 
> Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula "RX" 
> where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).
>
> Haloalkanes have been known for centuries. Chloroethane was produced in the 15th century. 
> The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century 
> in step with the development of organic chemistry and the understanding of the structure of alkanes. 
> 
> Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. 
> Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, 
> hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. 
> 
> These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented 
> that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry 
> because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.
>
> While many haloalkanes are human-produced, substantial amounts are biogenic.
