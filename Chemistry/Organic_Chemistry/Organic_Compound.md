> **Organic compound**s are a subclass of chemical compounds of carbon.  
> Little consensus exists among chemists on the exact definition of organic compound; 
> the only universally accepted definition is the quasi-tautological 
> "organic compounds are the subject matter of organic chemistry".  
>
> Generally, any large chemical compound containing a carbon–hydrogen or carbon–carbon bond 
> is accepted as an organic compound.  
> Thus alkanes (e.g. ethane, CH3−CH3) and their derivatives are typically considered organic.  
> For historical and disciplinary reasons, small molecules containing carbon are generally not accepted: 
> cyanide ion (CN−), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), chloroformic acid (ClCO2H), 
> carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbonate ion (CO2−3) may all be excluded.
>
> Due to carbon's ability to catenate (form chains with other carbon atoms), 
> millions of organic compounds are known.  
>
> Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of Earth's crust, 
> they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. 
> Living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds 
> through a network of processes (the carbon cycle) 
> that convert carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like water into simple sugars and other organic molecules. 
>
> In the chemical industry, synthetic organic compounds are ultimately derived from petrochemicals, 
> mainly hydrocarbons.  
> Petrochemicals are themselves formed from the geologic degradation of biological matter 
> at high pressures and temperatures underground. 
>
> Historically, organic compounds were defined as compounds originating in living things, 
> an expression of early-modern scientific vitalism.  
> As vitalism became increasingly untenable, 
> organic chemistry broadened its scope to study all large molecules; 
> at the time, all known large molecules contained carbon.  
> 
> Organic molecules discovered in biological contexts are now known as natural products.  
> In the 20th century, chemists discovered new large molecular species amongst the metal complexes.  
> Such objects are not admitted into general organic chemistry unless they also contain carbon; 
> otherwise their study is a new and separate field, metalorganic chemistry.  
>
> In chemical nomenclature, an organyl group, frequently represented by the letter R, 
> refers to any monovalent substituent whose open valence is on a carbon atom.
