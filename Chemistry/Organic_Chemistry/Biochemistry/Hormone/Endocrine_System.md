> The endocrine system is a messenger system in an organism comprising feedback loops of hormones 
> that are released by internal glands directly into the circulatory system 
> and that target and regulate distant organs. 
> In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems.
>
> In humans, the major endocrine glands are the thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary, pineal, and adrenal glands, 
> and the (male) testis and (female) ovaries. 
> 
> The hypothalamus, pancreas, and thymus also function as endocrine glands, among other functions. 
> (The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are organs of the neuroendocrine system. 
> One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus—
> it is located in the brain adjacent to the pituitary gland—
> is to link the endocrine system to the nervous system via the pituitary gland.) 
> Other organs, such as the kidneys, also have roles within the endocrine system by secreting certain hormones. 
> The study of the endocrine system and its disorders is known as [[endocrinology]].
>
> The thyroid secretes thyroxine, the pituitary secretes growth hormone, the pineal secretes melatonin, the testis secretes testosterone, and the ovaries secrete estrogen and progesterone.
>
> Glands that signal each other in sequence are often referred to as an axis, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. In addition to the specialized endocrine organs mentioned above, many other organs that are part of other body systems have secondary endocrine functions, including bone, kidneys, liver, heart and gonads. For example, the kidney secretes the endocrine hormone erythropoietin. Hormones can be amino acid complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, or prostaglandins.
>
> The endocrine system is contrasted both to exocrine glands, which secrete hormones to the outside of the body, and to the system known as  paracrine signalling between cells over a relatively short distance. Endocrine glands have no ducts, are vascular, and commonly have intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, mammary glands, and submucosal glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.
