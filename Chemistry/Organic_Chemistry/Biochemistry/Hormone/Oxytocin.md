> **Oxytocin** is a peptide hormone and neuropeptide 
> normally produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. 
> 
> Present in animals since early stages of evolution, 
> in humans it plays roles in behavior that include social bonding, love, reproduction, childbirth, 
> and the period after childbirth. 
> 
> Oxytocin is released into the bloodstream as a hormone in response to sexual activity and during childbirth. 
> It is also available in pharmaceutical form. 
> In either form, oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions to speed up the process of childbirth. 
>
> In its natural form, it also plays a role in maternal bonding and milk production. 
> Production and secretion of oxytocin is controlled by a positive feedback mechanism, 
> where its initial release stimulates production and release of further oxytocin. 
> 
> For example, when oxytocin is released during a contraction of the uterus at the start of childbirth, 
> this stimulates production and release of more oxytocin 
> and an increase in the intensity and frequency of contractions. 
> 
> This process compounds in intensity and frequency and continues until the triggering activity ceases. 
> A similar process takes place during lactation and during sexual activity.
>
> Oxytocin is derived by enzymatic splitting from the peptide precursor encoded by the human OXT gene. 
> The deduced structure of the active nonapeptide is:
>
> Cys – Tyr – Ile – Gln – Asn – Cys – Pro – Leu – Gly – NH2, or CYIQNCPLG-NH2.
