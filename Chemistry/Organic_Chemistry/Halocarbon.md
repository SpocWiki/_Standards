> **Halocarbon** compounds are chemical compounds in which one or more carbon atoms are linked by covalent bonds with one or more halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine – group 17) resulting in the formation of organofluorine compounds, organochlorine compounds, organobromine compounds, organoiodine compounds, and organoastatine compounds. Chlorine halocarbons are the most common and are called organochlorides.
>
> Many synthetic organic compounds such as plastic polymers, and a few natural ones, contain halogen atoms; they are known as halogenated compounds or organohalogens. Organochlorides are the most common industrially used organohalides, although the other organohalides are used commonly in organic synthesis. Except for extremely rare cases, organohalides are not produced biologically, but many pharmaceuticals are organohalides. Notably, many pharmaceuticals such as Prozac have trifluoromethyl groups.
