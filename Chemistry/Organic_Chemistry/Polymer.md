> A **Polymer** is a substance or material that consists of very large molecules, or macromolecules, 
> that are constituted by many repeating subunits derived from one or more species of monomers. 
> 
> Due to their broad spectrum of properties, 
> both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. 
> 
> Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene 
> to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins 
> that are fundamental to biological structure and function. 
> 
> Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, 
> known as monomers. 
> 
> Their consequently large molecular mass, relative to small molecule compounds, produces unique physical properties including toughness, high elasticity, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form amorphous and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.
>
> Polymers are studied in the fields of polymer science (which includes polymer chemistry and polymer physics), biophysics and materials science and engineering. Historically, products arising from the linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the primary focus of polymer science. An emerging important area now focuses on supramolecular polymers formed by non-covalent links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber is an example of a natural polymer, and the polystyrene of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids (polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are composed in large part of polymeric components.
