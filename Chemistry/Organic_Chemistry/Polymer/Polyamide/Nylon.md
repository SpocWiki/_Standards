> **Nylon** is a family of synthetic polymers characterized by amide linkages, 
> typically connecting aliphatic or semi-aromatic groups.
>
> Nylons are generally brownish in color and can possess a soft texture, 
> with some varieties exhibiting a silk-like appearance. 
> As thermoplastics, nylons can be melt-processed into fibers, films, and diverse shapes. 
> The properties of nylons are often modified by blending with a variety of additives.
>
> Numerous types of nylon are available. 
> One family, designated nylon-XY, is derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids 
> of carbon chain lengths X and Y, respectively. 
> 
> An important example is nylon-6,6 ((−C(O)(CH2)4C(O)−NH(CH2)6NH−)n). 
> Another family, designated nylon-Z, 
> is derived from aminocarboxylic acids with carbon chain length Z. An example is nylon-[6].
>
> Nylon polymers have extensive commercial applications, including uses in 
> textiles and fibers (such as apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), 
> molded components for automotive and electrical equipment, 
> and films (mostly for food packaging).
