## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Citric acid is an organic compound with the formula C6H8O7. 
> It is a colorless weak organic tri-anion acid. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. 
> In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, 
> which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.
>
> More than two million tons of citric acid are manufactured every year. 
> It is used widely as acidifier, flavoring, preservative, and chelating agent.
>
> A citrate is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the salts, esters, 
> and the polyatomic anion found in solutions and salts of citric acid. 
> An example of the former, a salt is trisodium citrate; an ester is triethyl citrate. 
> 
> When citrate trianion is part of a salt, 
> the formula of the citrate trianion is written as C6H5O3−7 or C3H5O(COO)3−3.
