> In organic chemistry, **Nitro compound**s are organic compounds 
> that contain one or more nitro functional groups (−NO2). 
> 
> The nitro group is one of the most common explosophores 
> (functional group that makes a compound explosive) used globally. 
> 
> The nitro group is also strongly electron-withdrawing. 
> 
> Because of this property, C−H bonds alpha (adjacent) to the nitro group can be acidic. 
> 
> For similar reasons, the presence of nitro groups in aromatic compounds 
> - retards electrophilic aromatic substitution but 
> - facilitates nucleophilic aromatic substitution.  
> 
> Nitro groups are rarely found in nature. 
> They are almost invariably produced by nitration reactions starting with nitric acid.
