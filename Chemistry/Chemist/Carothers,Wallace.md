> Wallace Hume Carothers (April 27, 1896 – April 29, 1937) was 
> an American chemist, inventor, and the leader of organic chemistry at DuPont, 
> who was credited with the invention of nylon.
>
> Carothers was a group leader at the DuPont Experimental Station laboratory, 
> near Wilmington, Delaware, where most polymer research was done. 
> 
> Carothers was an organic chemist who, in addition to first developing nylon, 
> also helped lay the groundwork for neoprene. 
> 
> After receiving his Ph.D., he taught at several universities 
> before he was hired by DuPont to work on fundamental research.
>
> He married Helen Sweetman on February 21, 1936. 
> Carothers had been troubled by periods of depression since his youth. 
> Despite his success with nylon, 
> he felt that he had not accomplished much and had run out of ideas. 
> His unhappiness was exacerbated by the death of his sister, 
> and on April 28, 1937, he committed suicide by drinking potassium cyanide, 
> sixteen months before the public announcement of nylon's discovery on October 27, 1938.  
> 
> His daughter, Jane, was born on November 27, 1937.
