> Fritz Haber (German pronunciation: [ˈfʁɪt͡s ˈhaːbɐ] ; 9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) 
> was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 
> for his invention of the[[../Chemical_Element/Group-15-Nitrogen/Haber–Bosch_Process]]], 
> a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. 
> 
> This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. 
> It is estimated that 
> __a third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process__, 
> and that __this food supports nearly half the world's population__. 
> 
> For this work, Haber has been called one of the 
> __most important scientists and industrial chemists in human history__. 
> Haber also, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle 
> as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. 
>
> Haber, a known German nationalist, is also considered the "father of chemical warfare" for his years of 
> pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I. 
> 
> He first proposed the use of the heavier-than-air chlorine gas as a weapon 
> to break the trench deadlock during the Second Battle of Ypres. 
> His work was later used, without his direct involvement, to develop the Zyklon B pesticide 
> used for the killing of more than 1 million Jews in gas chambers in the greater context of the Holocaust.
>
> After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Haber resigned from his position. 
> Already in poor health, he spent time in various countries 
> before Chaim Weizmann invited him to become the director of the Sieff Research Institute 
> (now the Weizmann Institute) in Rehovot, Mandatory Palestine. 
> He accepted the offer but died of heart failure mid-journey in a Basel, Switzerland hotel 
> on 29 January 1934, aged 65.
