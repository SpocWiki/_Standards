> Josiah Willard Gibbs (February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903) was an American mechanical engineer 
> and scientist who made fundamental theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. 
> 
> His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in 
> transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science. 
> 
> Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, he created statistical mechanics 
> (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics 
> as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system 
> composed of many particles. 
> 
> Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics.  
> As a mathematician, he created modern vector calculus 
> (independently of the British scientist Oliver Heaviside, 
> who carried out similar work during the same period) 
> and described the Gibbs phenomenon in the theory of Fourier analysis.
>
> In 1863, Yale University awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was a professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death in 1903. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by Albert Einstein as "the greatest mind in American history". In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London, "for his contributions to mathematical physics".
>
> Commentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century New England and the great international impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to Robert A. Millikan, in pure science, Gibbs "did for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure".
