> Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier ( lə-VWAH-zee-ay; French: [ɑ̃twan lɔʁɑ̃ də lavwazje]; 
> 26 August 1743 – 8 May 1794), also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution, 
> was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution 
> and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.
>
> It is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry 
> stem largely from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one.
>
> Lavoisier is noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion, 
> opposing the prior phlogiston theory of combustion.  
> He named oxygen (1778), recognizing it as an element, 
> and also recognized hydrogen as an element (1783).  
> 
> By using more precise measurements than previous experimenters, 
> he confirmed the theory that, although matter in a closed system may change its form or shape, 
> its mass always remains the same (now known as the law of conservation of mass), 
> which led to the development of the balanced physical and chemical reaction equations 
> that we still use, today.
>
> Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, 
> in which he predicted the existence of silicon, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. (1787)
>
> His wife and laboratory assistant, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, 
> became a renowned chemist in her own right, 
> and worked with him to develop the metric system of measurements.
>
> Lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils, 
> and an administrator of the Ferme générale. 
> The Ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the Ancien Régime 
> because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, 
> the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. 
> 
> All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. 
> At the height of the French Revolution, he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco, 
> and was guillotined despite appeals to spare his life in recognition of his contributions to science.  
> A year and a half later, he was exonerated by the French government.
