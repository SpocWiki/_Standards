# [[Cavendish_Experiment]] 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Cavendish experiment**, performed in 1797–1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish, 
> was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory 
> and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. 
> 
> Because of the unit conventions then in use, 
> the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. 
> Instead, the result was originally expressed as the relative density of Earth, 
> or equivalently the mass of Earth. 
> 
> His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants.
>
> The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, 
> who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. 
> 
> However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. 
> After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Cavendish, 
> who rebuilt it, but kept close to Michell's original plan. 
> 
> Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment 
> and reported his results in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1798.
