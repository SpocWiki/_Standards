> The word **Metalloid** comes from the Latin metallum ("metal") and the Greek oeides 
> ("resembling in form or appearance"). 
> However, there is no standard definition of a metalloid 
> and no complete agreement on which elements are metalloids. 
> Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature.
>
> The six commonly recognised metalloids are 
> - boron, silicon, 
> - germanium, 
> - arsenic, 
> - antimony and 
> - tellurium. 
> 
> Five elements are less frequently so classified: 
> - carbon, 
> - aluminium, 
> - selenium, 
> - polonium and 
> - astatine. 
> 
> On a standard periodic table, all eleven elements are in a diagonal region of the p-block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right. Some periodic tables include a dividing line between metals and nonmetals, and the metalloids may be found close to this line.
>
> Typical metalloids have a metallic appearance, may be brittle and are only fair conductors of electricity. They can form alloys with metals, and many of their other physical properties and chemical properties are intermediate between those of metallic and nonmetallic elements. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.
>
> The term metalloid originally referred to nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, as a category of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940â€“1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal has a more common usage as a specific kind of electronic band structure of a substance. In this context, only arsenic and antimony are semimetals, and commonly recognised as metalloids.
