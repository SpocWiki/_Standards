> **Formaldehyde** (  for-MAL-di-hide, US also   fər-) (systematic name methanal) is an organic compound 
> with the chemical formula CH2O and structure H−CHO, more precisely H2C=O. 
> 
> The compound is a pungent, colourless gas that polymerises spontaneously into paraformaldehyde. 
> It is stored as aqueous solutions (formalin), which consists mainly of the hydrate CH2(OH)2. 
> It is the simplest of the aldehydes (R−CHO). 
> 
> As a precursor to many other materials and chemical compounds, in 2006 
> the global production of formaldehyde was estimated at 12 million tons per year. 
> 
> It is mainly used in the production of industrial resins, e.g., for particle board and coatings. 
> Small amounts also occur naturally.
>
> Formaldehyde is classified as a carcinogen and can cause respiratory and skin irritation upon exposure.
