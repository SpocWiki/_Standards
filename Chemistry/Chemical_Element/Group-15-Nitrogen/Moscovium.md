> **Moscovium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Mc and atomic number 115. 
> 
> It was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists 
> at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. 
> 
> In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements 
> by the Joint Working Party of international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. 
> On 28 November 2016, it was officially named after the Moscow Oblast, 
> in which the JINR is situated.
>
> Moscovium is an extremely radioactive element: 
> its most stable known isotope, moscovium-290, has a half-life of only 0.65 seconds. 
> 
> In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest pnictogen. Moscovium is calculated to have some properties similar to its lighter homologues, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, and to be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. In particular, moscovium should also have significant similarities to thallium, as both have one rather loosely bound electron outside a quasi-closed shell. Chemical experimentation on single atoms has confirmed theoretical expectations that moscovium is less reactive than its lighter homologue bismuth. Over a hundred atoms of moscovium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 286 to 290.
