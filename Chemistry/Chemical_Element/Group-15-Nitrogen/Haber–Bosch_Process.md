This is the most important chemical Process. 2% of Energy is being invested to that. 
Every 2nd Nitrogen in our body was created by this Process. 
Human Waste is currently NOT re-used as Fertilizer, but degraded to N² by bacteria in [[Sewage]] Wastewater treatment
But the overproduction yields Nutrient-Pollution and [[Eutrophication]] [Harmful algal bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_algal_bloom "Harmful algal bloom"). 
Brennesseln und Brombeeren, die z.B. Blaubeeren überwuchern sind eine Folge, sowohl als auch [Harmful algal bloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_algal_bloom "Harmful algal bloom"). 
Only 20% of Fertilizer is used, the rest contributes to 
Mineral Fertilizer can be fine-adjusted to the soil.

> This reaction is thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, but the kinetics are prohibitively slow. At high temperatures at which catalysts are active enough that the reaction proceeds to equilibrium, the reaction is reactant-favored rather than product-favored. As a result, high pressures are needed to drive the reaction forward.

> The German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed the process in the first decade of the 20th century, and its improved efficiency over existing methods such as the Birkeland-Eyde and Frank-Caro processes was a major advancement in the industrial production of ammonia. The Haber process can be combined with steam reforming to produce ammonia with just three chemical inputs: water, natural gas, and atmospheric nitrogen. Both Haber and Bosch were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry: Haber in 1918 for ammonia synthesis specifically, and Bosch in 1931 for related contributions to high-pressure chemistry.
