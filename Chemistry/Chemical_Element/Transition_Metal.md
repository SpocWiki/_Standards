## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In chemistry, a transition metal (or transition element) 
> is a chemical element in the d-block of the periodic table (groups 3 to 12), 
> though the elements of group 12 (and less often group 3) are sometimes excluded. 
> 
> The lanthanide and actinide elements (the f-block) are called inner transition metals 
> and are sometimes considered to be transition metals as well.
>
> They are lustrous metals with good electrical and thermal conductivity. 
> Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, 
> and have high melting and boiling temperatures. 
> 
> They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states 
> and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. 
> 
> They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form 
> or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. 
> 
> Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, 
> as are many of their compounds. 
> 
> All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals 
> (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium).
>
> English chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890–1968) 
> first used the word transition in this context in 1921, when he referred to 
> a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons 
> (for example n = 3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) 
> from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32. 
> These elements are now known as the d-block.
