> **Darmstadtium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Ds and atomic number 110. 
> It is extremely radioactive: the most stable known isotope, darmstadtium-281, 
> has a half-life of approximately 14 seconds. 
> 
> Darmstadtium was first created in November 1994 
> by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in the city of Darmstadt, Germany, 
> after which it was named.
>
> In the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. 
> It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements, 
> although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out 
> to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum 
> in group 10 as the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals. 
> 
> Darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, 
> nickel, palladium, and platinum.
