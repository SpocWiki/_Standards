> A period 2 element is one of the chemical elements in the second row (or period) 
> of the periodic table of the chemical elements. 
> 
> The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) 
> trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases; 
> a new row is started when chemical behavior begins to repeat, 
> creating columns of elements with similar properties.
>
> The second period contains the elements 
> - lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon. 
> 
> In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, 
> this period corresponds to the filling of the second (n = 2) shell, 
> more specifically its 2s and 2p subshells. 
> 
> Period 2 elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and neon) obey the octet rule in that 
> they need eight electrons to complete their valence shell 
> (lithium and beryllium obey duet rule, boron is electron deficient.), 
> where at most eight electrons can be accommodated: 
> two in the 2s orbital and six in the 2p subshell.
