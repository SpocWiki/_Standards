> A period 1 element is one of the chemical elements 
> in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. 
> 
> The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) 
> trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: 
> a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, 
> meaning that analog elements fall into the same vertical columns. 
> 
> The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: 
> - hydrogen and helium. 
> 
> This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. 
> In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, 
> this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. 
> Period 1 elements obey the duet rule 
> in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell.
>
> Hydrogen and helium are the oldest and the most abundant elements in the universe.
