> A period on the periodic table is a row of chemical elements. 
> All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells. 
> 
> Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor. 
> Arranged this way, elements in the same group (column) 
> have similar chemical and physical properties, reflecting the periodic law. 
> 
> For example, the halogens lie in the second-to-last group (group 17) 
> and share similar properties, such as high reactivity 
> and the tendency to gain one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. 
> As of 2022, a total of 118 elements have been discovered and confirmed.
>
> Modern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties 
> in terms of electron shells. 
> 
> As atomic number increases, shells fill with electrons 
> in approximately the order shown in the ordering rule diagram. 
> The filling of each shell corresponds to a row in the table.
>
> In the f-block and p-block of the periodic table, 
> elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties (vertical trends down groups are more significant). 
> 
> However, in the d-block, trends across periods become significant, 
> and in the f-block elements show a high degree of similarity across periods.
