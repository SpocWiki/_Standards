> A period 3 element is one of the chemical elements 
> in the third row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. 
> 
> The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) 
> trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases: 
> a new row is begun when chemical behavior begins to repeat, 
> meaning that elements with similar behavior fall into the same vertical columns. 
> 
> The third period contains eight elements: 
> - sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine and argon. 
> 
> The first two, sodium and magnesium, are members of the s-block of the periodic table, 
> while the others are members of the p-block. 
> 
> All of the period 3 elements occur in nature and have at least one stable isotope.
