> **Meitnerium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Mt and atomic number 109. 
> 
> It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element 
> (an element not found in nature, but can be created in a laboratory). 
> 
> The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 4.5 seconds, 
> although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67 seconds. 
> The element was first synthesized in August 1982 
> by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, 
> and it was named after Lise Meitner in 1997. 
>
> In the periodic table, meitnerium is a d-block transactinide element. 
> It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements, 
> although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out 
> to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 
> as the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals. 
> 
> Meitnerium is calculated to have properties similar to its lighter homologues, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.
