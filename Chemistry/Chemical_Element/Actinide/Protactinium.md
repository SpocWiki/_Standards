> **Protactinium** is a chemical element; it has symbol Pa and atomic number 91. 
> It is a dense, radioactive, silvery-gray actinide metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor, and inorganic acids. 
> It forms various chemical compounds, in which protactinium is usually present in the oxidation state +5, 
> but it can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. 
> 
> Concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust are typically a few parts per trillion, 
> but may reach up to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits. 
> Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity, and high toxicity, 
> there are currently no uses for protactinium outside scientific research, 
> and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.
>
> The element was first identified in 1913 by Kazimierz Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring 
> and named "brevium" because of the short half-life of the specific isotope studied, protactinium-234m. 
> 
> A more stable isotope of protactinium, 231Pa, was discovered in 1917/18 by Lise Meitner in collaboration with Otto Hahn, 
> and they named the element protactinium. 
> In 1949, the IUPAC chose the name "protactinium" and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as its discoverers. 
> The new name meant "(nuclear) precursor of actinium," 
> suggesting that actinium is a product of radioactive decay of protactinium. 
> John Arnold Cranston (working with Frederick Soddy and Ada Hitchins) 
> is also credited with discovering the most stable isotope in 1915, 
> but he delayed his announcement due to being called for service in the First World War.
>
> The longest-lived and most abundant (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, 
> has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a decay product of uranium-235. 
> Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived protactinium-234 and its nuclear isomer protactinium-234m 
> occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. 
> 
> Protactinium-233 occurs as a result of the decay of thorium-233 as part of the chain of events 
> necessary to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. 
> 
> It is an undesired intermediate product in  thorium-based nuclear reactors, 
> and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. 
> 
> Ocean science utilizes the element to understand the ancient ocean's geography. 
> Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium, and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals 
> is used in radiometric dating of sediments up to 175,000 years old, and in modeling of various geological processes.
