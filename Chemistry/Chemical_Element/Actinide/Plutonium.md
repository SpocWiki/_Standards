## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Plutonium** is a chemical element; it has symbol Pu and atomic number 94. 
> It is a silvery-gray actinide metal that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. 
> The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. 
> It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen. 
> When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, 
> which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. 
> It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.
>
> Plutonium was first synthesized and isolated in late 1940 and early 1941, 
> by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5-metre (60 in) cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. 
> First, neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized, 
> which then beta-decayed to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). 
> 
> Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, 
> element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was also considered a planet. 
> Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948.
>
> Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number known to occur in nature. 
> Trace quantities arise in natural uranium deposits 
> when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms. 
> The heavy isotope plutonium-244 has a half-life long enough that 
> extreme trace quantities should have survived primordially (from the Earth's formation) to the present, 
> but so far experiments have not yet been sensitive enough to detect it.
>
> Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, meaning they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, 
> leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. 
> 
> Plutonium-240 has a high rate of spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.
>
> Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was
>  a major part of the Manhattan Project during World War II 
>  that developed the first atomic bombs. 
>  
>  The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, 
>  and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. 
>  
>  Human radiation experiments studying plutonium 
>  were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, 
>  some lethal, occurred after the war. 
>  
>  Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants 
>  and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War 
>  is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. 
>  
>  Other sources of plutonium in the environment 
>  are fallout from many above-ground nuclear tests, which are now banned.
