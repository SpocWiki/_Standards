> **Oganesson** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Og and atomic number 118. 
> It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, 
> near Moscow, Russia, by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. 
> 
> In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements 
> by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific bodies IUPAC and IUPAP. 
> It was formally named on 28 November 2016. 
> The name honors the nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, 
> who played a leading role in the discovery of the heaviest elements in the periodic table.
>
> Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. 
> On the periodic table of the elements it is a p-block element, a member of group 18, 
> and the last member of period 7. 
> 
> Its only known isotope, oganesson-294, is highly radioactive, with a half-life of 0.7 ms 
> and, as of 2025, only five atoms have been successfully produced. 
> 
> This has so far prevented any experimental studies of its chemistry. 
> Because of relativistic effects, theoretical studies predict 
> that it would be a solid at room temperature, 
> and significantly reactive, unlike the other members of group 18 (the noble gases).
