> **Livermorium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Lv and atomic number 116. 
> It is an extremely radioactive element that has only been created in a laboratory setting 
> and has not been observed in nature. 
> 
> The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, 
> which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, 
> to discover livermorium during experiments conducted between 2000 and 2006. 
> 
> The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California, where it is located, 
> which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. 
> The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. 
> Six isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers of 288–293 inclusive; 
> the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 80 milliseconds. A seventh possible isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.
>
> In the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. 
> It is a member of the 7th period 
> and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, 
> but it has not been confirmed to behave as 
> the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. 
> 
> Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its 
> lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), 
> and be a post-transition metal, 
> though it should also show several major differences from them.
