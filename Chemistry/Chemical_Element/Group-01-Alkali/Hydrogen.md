> **Hydrogen** is a chemical element; it has symbol H and atomic number 1. 
> It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, 
> is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, 
> but more commonly called hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen or simply hydrogen. 
> It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. 
> Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, 
> hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. 
> 
> Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, 
> while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as dihydrogen. 
> The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, 
> one electron, and no neutrons.
>
> In the early universe, the formation of hydrogen's protons occurred 
> in the first second after the Big Bang; 
> neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later 
> during the recombination epoch as the universe cooled 
> and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. 
> 
> Hydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, 
> readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, 
> contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. 
> Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, 
> which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. 
> 
> In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of 
> - either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, 
> - or as a positively charged cation, H+. 
> 
> The cation, usually just a proton (symbol p), 
> exhibits specific behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds 
> involves screening of its electric charge by surrounding polar molecules or anions. 
> 
> Hydrogen's unique position as the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be directly solved, has significantly contributed to the foundational principles of quantum mechanics through the exploration of its energetics and chemical bonding.
>
> Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by reacting acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means "water-former" in Greek.
>
> Most hydrogen production occurs through steam reforming of natural gas; 
> a smaller portion comes from energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water. 
> 
> Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing, such as hydrocracking, 
> and ammonia production, with emerging uses in fuel cells for electricity generation 
> and as a heat source. 
> 
> When used in fuel cells, hydrogen's only emission at point of use is water vapor, 
> though combustion can produce nitrogen oxides. 
> 
> Hydrogen's interaction with metals may cause embrittlement.

Hydrogen is classified by **"color labels"** to indicate the **primary energy source** and **carbon emissions profile** associated with its production.

## TriHydrogen 

### #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The trihydrogen cation or protonated molecular hydrogen is a cation (positive ion) 
> with formula H+3, consisting of three hydrogen nuclei (protons) sharing two electrons.
>
> The trihydrogen cation is one of the most abundant ions in the universe. 
> It is stable in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the low temperature and low density. 
> The role that H+3 plays in the gas-phase chemistry of the ISM 
> is unparalleled by any other molecular ion.
>
> The trihydrogen cation is the simplest triatomic molecule, 
> because its two electrons are the only valence electrons in the system. 
> It is also the simplest example of a three-center two-electron bond system.
