> **Coal** is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, 
> formed as rock strata called coal seams. 
> Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, 
> chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. 
>
> Coal is a type of fossil fuel, formed when dead plant matter decays into peat 
> which is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. 
> Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands 
> called coal forests that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas 
> during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.
>
> Coal is used primarily as a fuel. While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited until the Industrial Revolution. With the invention of the steam engine, coal consumption increased. In 2020, coal supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and over a third of its electricity. Some iron and steel-making and other industrial processes burn coal.
>
> The extraction and burning of coal damages the environment, causing premature death and illness, and it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change. Fourteen billion tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted by burning coal in 2020, which is 40% of total fossil fuel emissions and over 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As part of worldwide energy transition, many countries have reduced or eliminated their use of coal power. The United Nations Secretary General asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020.
>
> Global coal use was 8.3 billion tonnes in 2022, and is set to remain at record levels in 2023. To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming below 2 °C (3.6 °F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030, and "phasing down" coal was agreed upon in the Glasgow Climate Pact.
>
> The largest consumer and importer of coal in 2020 was China, which accounts for almost half the world's annual coal production, followed by India with about a tenth. Indonesia and Australia export the most, followed by Russia.
