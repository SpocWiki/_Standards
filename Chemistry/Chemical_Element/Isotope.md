## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Isotope**s are distinct nuclear species (or nuclides) of the **same chemical element**. 
> They have the same atomic number (number of protons in their nuclei) 
> and position in the periodic table (and hence belong to the same chemical element), 
> but different nucleon numbers (mass numbers) 
> due to different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. 
> While all isotopes of a given element have virtually the same chemical properties, 
> they have different atomic masses and physical properties.
>
> The term isotope comes from the Greek roots isos (ἴσος "equal") and topos (τόπος "place"), meaning "the same place": different isotopes of an element occupy the same place on the periodic table. It was coined by Scottish doctor and writer Margaret Todd in a 1913 suggestion to the British chemist Frederick Soddy, who popularized the term.
>
> The number of protons within the atom's nucleus is called its atomic number and is equal to the number of electrons in the neutral (non-ionized) atom. Each atomic number identifies a specific element, but not the isotope; an atom of a given element may have a wide range in its number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (both protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the atom's mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number.
>
> For example, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13, and 14, respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7, and 8 respectively.
