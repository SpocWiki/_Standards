## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ytterbium** is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::Yb) and atomic number (Charge-e::70). 
> It is a metal, the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series, 
> which is the basis of the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. 
> 
> However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, 
> as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. 
> 
> In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, 
> soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. 
> Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, 
> its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.
>
> In 1878, the Swiss chemist [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac]] 
> separated from the rare earth "erbia" another independent component, which he called "ytterbia", 
> for Ytterby, the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium. 
> 
> He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called "ytterbium" (in total, four elements were named after the village, the others being yttrium, terbium, and erbium). In 1907, the new earth "lutecia" was separated from ytterbia, from which the element "lutecium" (now lutetium) was extracted by Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James. After some discussion, Marignac's name "ytterbium" was retained. A relatively pure sample of the metal was not obtained until 1953. At present, ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media, and less often as a gamma ray source.
>
> Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 0.3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare-earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.
