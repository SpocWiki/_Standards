> Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating liquid flow in and out of cells. Other examples of ionic chlorides include potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Examples of covalent chlorides include methyl chloride (CH3Cl), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2), and monochloramine (NH2Cl).
