## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Phlogiston** theory, a superseded scientific theory, 
> postulated the existence of a fire-like  element dubbed phlogiston 
> contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. 
> 
> The name comes from the Ancient Greek φλογιστόν phlogistón (burning up), 
> from φλόξ phlóx (flame). 
> 
> The idea of a phlogistic substance was first proposed 
> in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher and later put together more formally 
> in 1697 by Georg Ernst Stahl. 
> 
> Phlogiston theory attempted to explain chemical processes 
> such as combustion and rusting, now collectively known as  oxidation. 
> 
> The theory was challenged by the concomitant mass increase 
> and was abandoned before the end of the 18th century 
> following experiments by Antoine Lavoisier in the 1770s and by other scientists. 
> 
> Phlogiston theory led to experiments that ultimately resulted in 
> the identification (c. 1771), and naming (1777), of oxygen by Joseph Priestley 
> and Antoine Lavoisier, respectively.
