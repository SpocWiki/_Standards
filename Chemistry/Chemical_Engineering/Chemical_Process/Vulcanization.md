## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Vulcanisation (American English: **Vulcanization**) 
> is a range of processes for hardening rubbers. 
> 
> The term **originally referred exclusively to** the 
> treatment of natural rubber with sulfur and heat, which remains the most common practice. 
> 
> It has also grown to include the hardening of other (synthetic) rubbers via various means. 
> Examples include silicone rubber via room temperature vulcanising 
> and chloroprene rubber (neoprene) using metal oxides. 
>
> Vulcanisation can be defined as the curing of elastomers, 
> with the terms 'vulcanisation' and 'curing' sometimes used interchangeably in this context. 
> 
> It works by forming cross-links between sections of the polymer chain 
> which results in increased rigidity and durability, 
> as well as other changes in the mechanical and electrical properties of the material. 
> 
> Vulcanisation, in common with the curing of other thermosetting polymers, 
> is **generally irreversible**.
>
> The word was suggested by William Brockedon 
> (a friend of Thomas Hancock who attained the British patent for the process) 
> based on the god Vulcan who was associated with heat and sulfur in volcanoes.
