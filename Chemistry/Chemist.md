> A chemist (from Greek chēm(ía) alchemy; 
> replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchemist) 
> is a graduated scientist trained in the study of chemistry, 
> or an officially enrolled student in the relevant field. 
> 
> **Chemists** study the composition of matter and its properties. 
> Chemists carefully describe the properties they study 
> in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules 
> and their component atoms. 
> 
> Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, 
> chemical reaction rates, and other chemical properties. 
> In Commonwealth English, pharmacists are often called chemists.
>
> Chemists use their knowledge to learn 
> the composition and properties of unfamiliar substances, 
> as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities 
> of useful naturally occurring substances 
> and create new artificial substances and useful processes. 
> 
> Chemists may specialize in subdisciplines of chemistry. 
> 
> Materials scientists and metallurgists share much of the same 
> education and skills with chemists. 
> 
> The work of chemists is often related to 
> the work of chemical engineers, 
> who are primarily concerned with the proper design, 
> construction and evaluation of 
> the most cost-effective large-scale chemical plants 
> and work closely with industrial chemists 
> on the development of new processes and methods 
> for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals 
> and related products.
