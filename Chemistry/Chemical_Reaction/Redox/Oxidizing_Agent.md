## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An oxidizing agent (also known as an oxidant, oxidizer, electron recipient, or electron acceptor) 
> is a substance in a [[../Redox]] chemical reaction that gains or "accepts"/"receives" an electron 
> from a [[Reducing_Agent]] (called the reductant, reducer, or electron donor). 
> 
> In other words, an oxidizer is any substance that oxidizes another substance. The oxidation state, which describes the degree of loss of electrons, of the oxidizer decreases while that of the reductant increases; this is expressed by saying that oxidizers "undergo reduction" and "are reduced" while reducers "undergo oxidation" and "are oxidized".
>
> Common oxidizing agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and the halogens.
>
> In one sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that undergoes a chemical reaction in which it gains one or more electrons. In that sense, it is one component in an oxidationâ€“reduction (redox) reaction. In the second sense, an oxidizing agent is a chemical species that transfers electronegative atoms, usually oxygen, to a substrate. Combustion, many explosives, and organic redox reactions involve atom-transfer reactions.
