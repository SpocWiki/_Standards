> Chemical synthesis (chemical combination) 
> is the artificial execution of chemical reactions to obtain one or several products. 
> This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. 
> In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable.
>
> A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) 
> that will experience a transformation under certain conditions. 
> Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. 
> This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, 
> such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. 
> Many reactions require some form of processing ("work-up") or purification procedure 
> to isolate the final product.
>
> The amount produced by chemical synthesis is known as the reaction yield. 
> Typically, yields are expressed as a mass in grams (in a laboratory setting) 
> or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity that could be produced 
> based on the limiting reagent. 
> 
> A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction that can reduce the desired yield. 
> The word synthesis was used first in a chemical context by the chemist Hermann Kolbe.
