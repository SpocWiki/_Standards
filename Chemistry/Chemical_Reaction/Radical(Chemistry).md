## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In chemistry, a radical, also known as a free radical, 
> is an atom, molecule, or ion that has at least one unpaired valence electron.
>
> With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly chemically reactive. 
> Many radicals spontaneously dimerize. Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.
>
> A notable example of a radical is the hydroxyl radical (HO·), 
> a molecule that has one unpaired electron on the oxygen atom. 
> Two other examples are triplet oxygen and triplet carbene (꞉CH2) 
> which have two unpaired electrons.
>
> Radicals may be generated in a number of ways, but typical methods including 
> redox reactions, ionizing radiation, heat, electrical discharges, and electrolysis 
> are known to produce radicals. 
> 
> Radicals are intermediates in many chemical reactions, 
> more so than is apparent from the balanced equations. 
>
> Radicals are important in combustion, atmospheric chemistry, polymerization, 
> plasma chemistry, biochemistry, and many other chemical processes. 
> 
> A majority of natural products are generated by radical-generating enzymes. 
> 
> In living organisms, the radicals superoxide and nitric oxide 
> and their reaction products regulate many processes, 
> such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. 
> 
> They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. 
> Such radicals are also messengers in a process dubbed redox signaling. 
> 
> A radical may be trapped within a solvent cage or be otherwise bound.
