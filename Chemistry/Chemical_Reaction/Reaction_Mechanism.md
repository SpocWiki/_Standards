> In chemistry, a reaction mechanism is the step by step sequence of elementary reactions 
> by which overall chemical reaction occurs.
>
> A chemical mechanism is a theoretical conjecture 
> that tries to describe in detail what takes place at each stage of an overall chemical reaction. 
> 
> The detailed steps of a reaction are not observable in most cases. 
> The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible 
> and has experimental support in isolated intermediates 
> or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. 
> 
> It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, 
> which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). 
> 
> A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, 
> the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, 
> all products formed and the amount of each. 
>
> The electron or arrow pushing method is often used in illustrating a reaction mechanism; 
> for example, see the illustrations of the mechanisms for Michael addition and benzoin condensation in the following examples section.
>
> 
>
> Mechanisms also are of interest in inorganic chemistry.  A often quoted mechanistic experiment involved the reaction of the labile hexaaquo chromous reductant with the exchange inert pentammine cobalt(III) chloride.
