## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A substitution reaction (AKA single displacement or single substitution reaction) 
> is a chemical reaction during which one functional group in a chemical compound 
> is replaced by another functional group. 
> 
> Substitution reactions are of prime importance in organic chemistry. 
> 
> Substitution reactions in organic chemistry are classified 
> either as electrophilic or nucleophilic depending upon the reagent involved, 
> whether a reactive intermediate involved in the reaction is a carbocation, 
> a carbanion or a free radical, and whether the substrate is aliphatic or aromatic. 
> 
> Detailed understanding of a reaction type helps to predict the product outcome in a reaction. 
> It also is helpful for optimizing a reaction with regard to variables such as temperature and choice of solvent.
>
> A good example of a substitution reaction is halogenation. 
> When chlorine gas (Cl2) is irradiated, some of the molecules are split into two chlorine radicals (Cl•), 
> whose free electrons are strongly nucleophilic. 
> 
> One of them breaks a C–H covalent bond in CH4 
> and grabs the hydrogen atom to form the electrically neutral HCl. 
> 
> The other radical reforms a covalent bond with the CH3• to form CH3Cl (methyl chloride).
