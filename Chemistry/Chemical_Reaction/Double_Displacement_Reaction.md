> A salt metathesis reaction (also called a double displacement reaction, double replacement reaction, or double decomposition) is a type of chemical reaction 
> in which two ionic compounds in aqueous solution 
> exchange their component ions to form two new compounds. 
> AB + CD ⟶ AD + CB
> 
> Often, one of these new compounds is a precipitate, gas, or weak electrolyte, 
> driving the reaction forward.
>
> In older literature, the term double decomposition is common. The term double decomposition is more specifically used when at least one of the substances does not dissolve in the solvent, as the ligand or ion exchange takes place in the solid state of the reactant. For example:
>
> AX(aq) + BY(s) → AY(aq) + BX(s).
