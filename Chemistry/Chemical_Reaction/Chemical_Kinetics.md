## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Chemical kinetics, also known as reaction kinetics, is the branch of physical chemistry 
> that is concerned with understanding the rates of chemical reactions. 
> 
> It is different from chemical thermodynamics, 
> which deals with the direction in which a reaction occurs 
> but in itself tells nothing about its rate. 
> 
> Chemical kinetics includes investigations 
> of how experimental conditions influence the speed of a chemical reaction 
> and yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition states, 
> as well as the construction of mathematical models 
> that also can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.
