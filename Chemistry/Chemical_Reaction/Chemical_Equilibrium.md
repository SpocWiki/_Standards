> In a chemical reaction, chemical equilibrium is the 
> state in which both the reactants and products are present in concentrations 
> which have no further tendency to change with time, 
> so that there is no observable change in the properties of the system. 
> 
> This state results 
> when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction. 
> The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, 
> but they are equal. 
> Thus, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products. 
> Such a state is known as dynamic equilibrium.
>
> It is the subject of study of equilibrium chemistry.
