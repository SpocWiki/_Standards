> A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction 
> in the form of symbols and chemical formulas. 
> 
> The reactant entities are given on the left-hand side 
> and the product entities are on the right-hand side 
> with a plus sign between the entities in both the reactants and the products, 
> and an arrow that points towards the products to show the direction of the reaction. 
> 
> The chemical formulas may be symbolic, structural (pictorial diagrams), or intermixed. 
> The coefficients next to the symbols and formulas of entities 
> are the absolute values of the stoichiometric numbers. 
> The first chemical equation was diagrammed by Jean Beguin in 1615.
