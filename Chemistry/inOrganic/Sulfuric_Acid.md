> **Sulfuric acid** (American spelling and the preferred IUPAC name) 
> or sulphuric acid (Commonwealth spelling), known in antiquity as oil of vitriol, 
> is a mineral acid composed of the elements sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen, 
> with the molecular formula H2SO4. 
> It is a colorless, odorless, and viscous liquid that is miscible with water.
>
> Pure sulfuric acid does not occur naturally due to its strong affinity to water vapor; 
> it is hygroscopic and readily absorbs water vapor from the air. 
> Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidant with powerful dehydrating properties, making it highly corrosive towards other materials, from rocks to metals. Phosphorus pentoxide is a notable exception in that it is not dehydrated by sulfuric acid but, to the contrary, dehydrates sulfuric acid to sulfur trioxide. Upon addition of sulfuric acid to water, a considerable amount of heat is released; thus, the reverse procedure of adding water to the acid is generally avoided since the heat released may boil the solution, spraying droplets of hot acid during the process. Upon contact with body tissue, sulfuric acid can cause severe acidic chemical burns and secondary thermal burns due to dehydration. Dilute sulfuric acid is substantially less hazardous without the oxidative and dehydrating properties; though, it is handled with care for its acidity.

> Many methods for its production are known, including the contact process, the wet sulfuric acid process, and the lead chamber process. Sulfuric acid is also a key substance in the chemical industry. It is most commonly used in fertilizer manufacture but is also important in mineral processing, oil refining, wastewater treating, and chemical synthesis. It has a wide range of end applications, including in domestic acidic drain cleaners, as an electrolyte in lead-acid batteries, as a dehydrating compound, and in various cleaning agents.
