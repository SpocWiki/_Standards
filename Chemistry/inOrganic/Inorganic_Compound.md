> An inorganic compound is a chemical compound that lacks carbonâ€“hydrogen bonds, 
> that is, a compound that is not an organic compound. 
> The study of inorganic compounds is a subfield of chemistry known as inorganic chemistry.
>
> Inorganic compounds comprise most of the Earth's crust, 
> although the compositions of the deep mantle remain active areas of investigation.
>
> All allotropes (structurally different pure forms of an element) 
> and some simple carbon compounds are often considered inorganic. 
> 
> Examples include the allotropes of carbon (graphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene, graphene, etc.), carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, carbides, 
> and salts of inorganic anions such as carbonates, cyanides, cyanates, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, etc. 
> 
> Many of these are normal parts of mostly organic systems, including organisms; 
> describing a chemical as inorganic does not necessarily mean that it cannot occur within living things.
