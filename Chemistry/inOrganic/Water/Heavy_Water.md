> Heavy water (deuterium oxide, 2H2O, D2O) is a form of water 
> in which hydrogen atoms are all deuterium (2H or D, also known as heavy hydrogen) 
> rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope (1H, also called protium) 
> that makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. 
> 
> The presence of the heavier isotope gives the water different nuclear properties, 
> and the increase in mass gives it slightly different physical and chemical properties 
> when compared to normal water.
>
> Deuterium is a heavy hydrogen isotope. 
> Heavy water contains deuterium atoms and is used in nuclear reactors. 
> Semiheavy water (HDO) is more common than pure heavy water, 
> while heavy-oxygen water is denser but lacks unique properties. 
> Tritiated water is radioactive due to tritium content.
>
> Heavy water has different physical properties from regular water, 
> such as being 10.6% denser and having a higher melting point. 
> 
> Heavy water is less dissociated at a given temperature, 
> and it does not have the slightly blue color of regular water. 
> It can taste slightly sweeter than regular water, though not to a significant degree. 
> 
> Heavy water affects biological systems by altering enzymes, hydrogen bonds, and cell division in eukaryotes. 
> It can be lethal to multicellular organisms at concentrations over 50%. 
> However, some prokaryotes like bacteria can survive in a heavy hydrogen environment. 
> Heavy water can be toxic to humans, but a large amount would be needed for poisoning to occur.
>
> The most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the Girdler sulfide process. 
> Heavy water is used in various industries and is sold in different grades of purity. 
> Some of its applications include nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, 
> neutron moderation, neutrino detection, metabolic rate testing, neutron capture therapy, 
> and the production of radioactive materials such as plutonium and tritium.
