> **Dew** is water in the form of droplets 
> that appears on thin, exposed objects in the morning or evening due to condensation. 
>
> As the exposed surface cools by radiating its heat, 
> atmospheric moisture condenses at a rate greater than that at which it can evaporate, 
> resulting in the formation of water droplets.
>
> When temperatures are low enough, dew takes the form of ice, called frost.
>
> Because dew is related to the temperature of surfaces, in late summer it forms most easily on surfaces 
> that are not warmed by conducted heat from deep ground, 
> such as grass, leaves, railings, car roofs, and bridges.
