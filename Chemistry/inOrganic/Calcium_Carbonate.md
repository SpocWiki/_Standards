> Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CaCO3. 
> It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite, 
> most notably in chalk and limestone, eggshells, gastropod shells, shellfish skeletons and pearls. 
> Materials containing much calcium carbonate or resembling it are described as calcareous. 
> Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime 
> and is produced when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to form limescale. 
> 
> It has medical use as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, 
> but excessive consumption can be hazardous and cause hypercalcemia and digestive issues.
