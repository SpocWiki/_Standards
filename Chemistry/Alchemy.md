> **Alchemy** (from the Arabic word al-kīmīā, الكیمیاء) is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, 
> a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practised in China, India, 
> the Muslim world, and Europe. 
> 
> In its Western form, alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts 
> written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries AD. 
> Greek-speaking alchemists often referred to their craft as "the Art" (τέχνη) or "Knowledge" (ἐπιστήμη), 
> and it was often characterised as mystic (μυστική), sacred (ἱɛρά), or divine (θɛíα).
>
> Alchemists attempted to purify, mature, and perfect certain materials. 
> Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e.g., lead) 
> into "noble metals" (particularly gold); 
> the creation of an elixir of immortality; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease. 
> 
> The perfection of the human body and soul 
> was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ("Great Work"). 
> The concept of creating the philosophers' stone was variously connected with all of these projects.
>
> Islamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques, 
> theories, and terms, some of which are still in use today. 
> They did not abandon the Ancient Greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements, 
> and they tended to guard their work in secrecy, often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism. 
> 
> In Europe, the 12th-century translations of medieval Islamic works on science 
> and the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy. 
> This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role 
> in the development of early modern science (particularly chemistry and medicine).
>
> Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into 
> - an examination of its exoteric practical applications 
> - and its esoteric spiritual aspects, 
> despite criticisms by scholars such as Eric J. Holmyard and Marie-Louise von Franz 
> that they should be understood as complementary. 
> 
> The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences, 
> who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry, medicine, and charlatanism, 
> and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. 
> 
> The latter interests historians of esotericism, psychologists, and some philosophers and spiritualists. 
> The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.
