## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of chemistry represents a time span from ancient history to the present. 
> By 1000 BC, civilizations used technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples include the discovery of fire, extracting metals from ores, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into soap, making glass,
>
> and making alloys like bronze.
>
> The protoscience of chemistry, and alchemy, was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations. However, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry.
>
> The history of chemistry is intertwined with the history of thermodynamics, especially through the work of Willard Gibbs.
