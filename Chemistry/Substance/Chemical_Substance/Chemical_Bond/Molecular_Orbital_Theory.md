> In chemistry, molecular orbital theory (MO theory or MOT) 
> is a method for describing the electronic structure of molecules using quantum mechanics. 
> It was proposed early in the 20th century. 
> The MOT explains the paramagnetic nature of O2, which valence bond theory cannot explain.
>
> In molecular orbital theory, 
> electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, 
> but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. 
> 
> Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons 
> as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule 
> and contain valence electrons between atoms.
>
> Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding 
> by approximating the states of bonded electrons – the molecular orbitals – 
> as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). 
> 
> These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) 
> or Hartree–Fock (HF) models to the Schrödinger equation.
>
> Molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory 
> are the foundational theories of quantum chemistry.
