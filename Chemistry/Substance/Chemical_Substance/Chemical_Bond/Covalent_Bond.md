# [[Covalent_Bond]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[../../../../WikiData/WD~Covalent_bond,127920|WD~Covalent_bond,127920]] 

Covalent Bonds allow for less localized States of the electrons, 
which corresponds to a smaller Momentum uncertainty 
and therefore (since the average momentum is 0), also lower-energy. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electrons to form electron pairs between atoms. 
> These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs. 
> The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, 
> when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. 
> 
> For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, 
> corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. 
> In organic chemistry, covalent bonding is much more common than ionic bonding.
>
> Covalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including 
> σ-bonding, π-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, 
> three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds. 
> 
> The term "covalence" was introduced by Irving Langmuir in 1919, 
> with Nevil Sidgwick using "co-valent link" in the 1920s. 
> Merriam-Webster dates the specific phrase covalent bond to 1939, recognizing its first known use. 
> The prefix co- (jointly, partnered) indicates that "co-valent" bonds involve shared "valence", 
> as detailed in valence bond theory.
>
> In the molecule H2, the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. 
> Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. 
> Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, 
> only that they be of **comparable electronegativity**. 
> Covalent bonding that entails the sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized.
