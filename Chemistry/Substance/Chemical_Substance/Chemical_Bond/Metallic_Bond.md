> **Metallic bond**ing is a type of chemical bonding 
> that arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons 
> (in the form of an electron cloud of delocalized electrons) and positively charged metal ions. 
> 
> It may be described as the sharing of free electrons among a structure of positively charged ions (cations). 
> Metallic bonding accounts for many physical properties of metals, 
> such as strength, ductility, thermal and electrical resistivity and conductivity, opacity, and lustre.
>
> Metallic bonding is not the only type of chemical bonding a metal can exhibit, even as a pure substance. 
> 
> For example, elemental gallium consists of covalently-bound pairs of atoms in both liquid and solid-state—
> these pairs form a crystal structure with metallic bonding between them. 
> 
> Another example of a metal–metal covalent bond is the mercurous ion (Hg2+2).
