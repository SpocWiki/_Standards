> A cation is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons (e.g. K+ (potassium ion)) 
> while an anion is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons (e.g. Cl− (chloride ion) and OH− (hydroxide ion)). Opposite electric charges are pulled towards one another by electrostatic force, so cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds. Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed monatomic ions, atomic ions or simple ions, while ions consisting of two or more atoms are termed polyatomic ions or molecular ions.
>
> If only a + or − is present, it indicates a +1 or −1 charge, as seen in Na+ (sodium ion) and F− (fluoride ion). To indicate a more severe charge, the number of additional or missing electrons is supplied, as seen in O2−2 (peroxide, negatively charged, polyatomic) and He2+ (alpha particle, positively charged, monatomic).

> In the case of physical ionization in a fluid (gas or liquid), "ion pairs" are created by spontaneous molecule collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion. Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a direct current through a conducting solution, dissolving an anode via ionization.
