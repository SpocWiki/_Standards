> In chemistry, **Peroxide**s are a group of compounds with the structure R−O−O−R, 
> where each R represents a radical (a portion of a complete molecule; not necessarily a free radical) 
> and the Os are single oxygen atoms. 
> 
> Oxygen atoms are joined to each other and to adjacent elements through single covalent bonds, 
> denoted by dashes or lines. 
> 
> The O−O group in a peroxide is often called the peroxide group, 
> though some nomenclature discrepancies exist. 
> 
> This linkage is recognized as a common polyatomic ion, and exists in many molecules.
