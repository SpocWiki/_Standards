> **Hydrolysis** (; from Ancient Greek  hydro- 'water' and  lysis 'to unbind') 
> is any chemical reaction in which a molecule of water breaks one or more chemical bonds. 
> The term is used broadly for substitution, elimination, and solvation reactions 
> in which water is the nucleophile.
>
> Biological hydrolysis is the cleavage of biomolecules where a water molecule is consumed 
> to effect the separation of a larger molecule into component parts. 
> 
> When a carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis 
> (e.g., sucrose being broken down into glucose and fructose), 
> this is recognized as saccharification.
>
> Hydrolysis reactions can be the reverse of a condensation reaction 
> in which two molecules join into a larger one and eject a water molecule. 
> Thus hydrolysis adds water to break down, whereas condensation builds up by removing water.
