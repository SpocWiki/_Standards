> Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bonding 
> that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, 
> or between two atoms with sharply different electronegativities, 
> and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds. 
> 
> It is one of the main types of bonding, along with covalent bonding and metallic bonding. 
> Ions are atoms (or groups of atoms) with an electrostatic charge. 
> Atoms that gain electrons make negatively charged ions (called anions). 
> Atoms that lose electrons make positively charged ions (called cations). 
> 
> Ionic compounds **conduct electricity when molten or in solution**, typically not when solid. 
> Ionic compounds generally have a **high melting point**, depending on the charge of the ions they consist of. 
> The higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting point. 
> They also tend to be soluble in water; the stronger the cohesive forces, the lower the solubility.
>
> This transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to covalence. 
> In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, 
> but these ions can be more complex, e.g. polyatomic ions like NH+4 or SO2−4. 
> In simpler words, an ionic bond results from the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal 
> to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.
>
> Clean ionic bonding — in which one atom or molecule completely transfers an electron to another — 
> cannot exist: all ionic compounds have some degree of covalent bonding or electron sharing. 
> Thus, the term "ionic bonding" is given when the ionic character is greater than the covalent character – 
> that is, a bond in which there is a large difference in electronegativity between the cation and anion, 
> causing the bonding to be more polar (ionic) than in covalent bonding where electrons are shared more equally. 
> Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent characters are called **polar covalent bonds**.
