> A chemical formula is a way of  presenting information about the 
> chemical proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, 
> using chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, 
> such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (−) signs. 
> 
> These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, 
> which may include subscripts and superscripts. 
> A chemical formula is not a chemical name since it does not contain any words. 
> 
> Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, 
> it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula.

> Chemical formulae can fully specify the structure of

> The simplest types of chemical formulae are called empirical formulae, 
> which use letters and numbers indicating the numerical proportions of atoms of each type. 
> Molecular formulae indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, 
> with no information on structure. 
> For example, the empirical formula for glucose is CH2O 
> (twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon and oxygen), 
> while its molecular formula is C6H12O6 (12 hydrogen atoms, six carbon and oxygen atoms).

> This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension.

> Chemical formulae may be used in chemical equations to describe chemical reactions and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulae do not have the full power of structural formulae to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus balancing chemical equations so that these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric charge.
