> A chemical bond is the association of atoms or ions to form molecules, crystals, and other structures. 
> The bond may result from the electrostatic force between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds 
> or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds, or some combination of these effects. 
> 
> Chemical bonds are described as having different strengths: 
> there are "strong bonds" or "primary bonds" such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonds, 
> and "weak bonds" or "secondary bonds" such as dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, 
> the London dispersion force, and hydrogen bonding.  
>
> Since opposite electric charges attract, the negatively charged electrons surrounding the nucleus 
> and the positively charged protons within a nucleus attract each other. 
> Electrons shared between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them. 
> "Constructive quantum mechanical wavefunction interference" stabilizes the paired nuclei 
> (see Theories of chemical bonding). 
> Bonded nuclei maintain an optimal distance (the bond distance) 
> balancing attractive and repulsive effects explained quantitatively by quantum theory.
>
> The atoms in molecules, crystals, metals and other forms of matter are held together by chemical bonds, 
> which determine the structure and properties of matter.
>
> All bonds can be described by quantum theory, but, in practice, 
> simplified rules and other theories allow chemists to predict the strength, directionality, and polarity of bonds. 
> 
> The octet rule and VSEPR theory are examples. 
> More sophisticated theories are valence bond theory, which includes orbital hybridization and resonance, 
> and molecular orbital theory which includes the linear combination of atomic orbitals and ligand field theory. 
> Electrostatics are used to describe bond polarities and the effects they have on chemical substances.
