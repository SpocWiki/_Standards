> In chemistry, a **Solution** is defined by IUPAC as 
> "A liquid or solid phase containing more than one substance, 
> when for convenience one (or more) substance, which is called the solvent, 
> is treated differently from the other substances, which are called solutes." 
> 
> When, as is often but not necessarily the case, the sum of the mole fractions of solutes 
> is small compared with unity, the solution is called a dilute solution. 
> 
> A superscript attached to the ∞ symbol for a property of a solution 
> denotes the property in the limit of infinite dilution. 
> 
> One parameter of a solution is the concentration, 
> which is a measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solution or solvent. 
> 
> The term "aqueous solution" is used when one of the solvents is water.
