> A dispersion is a system in which distributed particles of one material 
> are dispersed in a continuous phase of another material. 
> The two phases may be in the same or different states of matter.
>
> Dispersions are classified in a number of different ways, 
> including how large the particles are in relation to the particles of the continuous phase, 
> whether or not precipitation occurs, and the presence of Brownian motion.  
> 
> In general, dispersions of particles sufficiently large for sedimentation are called suspensions, 
> while those of smaller particles are called colloids and solutions.
