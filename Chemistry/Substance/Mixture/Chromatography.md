## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In chemical analysis, **Chromatography** is a laboratory technique 
> for the separation of a mixture into its components. 
> 
> The mixture is dissolved in a fluid solvent (gas or liquid) called the mobile phase, 
> which carries it through a system (a column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) 
> on which a material called the stationary phase is fixed. 
> 
> As the different constituents of the mixture tend to have different affinities for the stationary phase 
> and are retained for different lengths of time depending on their interactions with its surface sites, 
> the constituents travel at different apparent velocities in the mobile fluid, causing them to separate. 
> 
> The separation is based on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. 
> Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient 
> result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus affect the separation.
>
> Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. 
> The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for later use, 
> and is thus a form of purification. 
> This process is associated with higher costs due to its mode of production. 
> 
> Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material 
> and is for establishing the presence or measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. 
> The two types are not mutually exclusive.
