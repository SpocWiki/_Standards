## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A colloid is a mixture in which one substance consisting of 
> microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. 
> Some definitions specify that the particles must be dispersed in a liquid, 
> while others extend the definition to include substances like aerosols and gels. 
> 
> The term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture 
> (although a narrower sense of the word suspension is distinguished from **colloids** by larger particle size). 
> A colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). 
>
> Since the definition of a colloid is so ambiguous, 
> the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) formalized a modern definition of colloids: 
> "The term colloidal refers to a state of subdivision, 
> implying that the molecules or polymolecular particles dispersed in a medium 
> have at least in one direction a dimension roughly between 1 nanometre and 1 micrometre, 
> or that in a system discontinuities are found at distances of that order. 
> It is not necessary for all three dimensions to be in the colloidal range…
> Nor is it necessary for the units of a colloidal system to be discrete…
> The size limits given above are not rigid since they will depend to some extent on the properties under consideration.” 
> 
> This IUPAC definition is particularly important because it highlights the flexibility inherent in colloidal systems. 
> However, much of the confusion surrounding colloids arises from oversimplifications. 
> IUPAC makes it clear that exceptions exist, and the definition should not be viewed as a rigid rule. 
> D.H. Everett—the scientist who wrote the IUPAC definition—
> emphasized that colloids are often better understood through examples rather than strict definitions.
>
> Some colloids are translucent because of the Tyndall effect, which is the scattering of light by particles in the colloid. Other colloids may be opaque or have a slight color.
>
> Colloidal suspensions are the subject of interface and colloid science. 
> This field of study began in 1845 by Francesco Selmi, who called them pseudosolutions, 
> and expanded by Michael Faraday and Thomas Graham, who coined the term colloid in 1861.
