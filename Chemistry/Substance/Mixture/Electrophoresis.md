> **Electrophoresis** is the motion of charged dispersed particles 
> or dissolved charged molecules relative to a fluid 
> under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. 
> 
> As a rule, these are zwitterions with a positive or negative net charge.
>
> Electrophoresis is used in laboratories to separate macromolecules based on their charges. 
> The technique normally applies a negative charge called cathode 
> so anionic protein molecules move towards a positive charge called anode. 
> Therefore, electrophoresis of positively charged particles or molecules (cations) is sometimes called cataphoresis, 
> while electrophoresis of negatively charged particles or molecules (anions) is sometimes called anaphoresis.
>
> Electrophoresis is the basis for analytical techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate particles, molecules, or ions by size, charge, or binding affinity, either freely or through a supportive medium using a one-directional flow of electrical charge. It is used extensively in DNA, RNA and protein analysis.
>
> Liquid "droplet electrophoresis" is significantly different from the classic "particle electrophoresis" because of droplet characteristics such as a mobile surface charge and the nonrigidity of the interface. Also, the liquid–liquid system, where there is an interplay between the hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces in both phases, adds to the complexity of electrophoretic motion.
