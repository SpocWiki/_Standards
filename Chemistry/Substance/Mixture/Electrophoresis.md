> **Electrophoresis** is the motion of charged dispersed particles 
> or dissolved charged molecules relative to a fluid 
> under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. 
> 
> As a rule, these are zwitterions with a positive or negative net charge.
>
> Electrophoresis is used in laboratories to separate macromolecules based on their charges. 
> The technique normally applies a negative charge called cathode 
> so anionic protein molecules move towards a positive charge called anode. 
> Therefore, electrophoresis of positively charged particles or molecules (cations) is sometimes called cataphoresis, 
> while electrophoresis of negatively charged particles or molecules (anions) is sometimes called anaphoresis.
>
> Electrophoresis is the basis for analytical techniques used in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate particles, molecules, or ions by size, charge, or binding affinity, either freely or through a supportive medium using a one-directional flow of electrical charge. It is used extensively in DNA, RNA and protein analysis.
>
> Liquid "droplet electrophoresis" is significantly different from the classic "particle electrophoresis" because of droplet characteristics such as a mobile surface charge and the nonrigidity of the interface. Also, the liquidâ€“liquid system, where there is an interplay between the hydrodynamic and electrokinetic forces in both phases, adds to the complexity of electrophoretic motion.
