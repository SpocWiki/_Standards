> **organometallic** [[../../Knowledge/Chemistry|chemistry]] is the study of organometallic compounds, 
> chemical compounds containing at least one chemical bond 
> - between a carbon atom of an organic molecule 
> - and a metal, including alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metals, 
> - and sometimes broadened to include metalloids like [[Chemical_Element/Group-13-Boron/Boron|boron]], [[Chemical_Element/Group-14-Carbon/Silicon|silicon]], and [[Chemical_Element/Group-16-Chalcogene/Selenium|selenium]], as well. 
> 
> Aside from bonds to organyl fragments or molecules, 
> bonds to 'inorganic' [[Chemical_Element/Group-14-Carbon/Carbon|carbon]], like carbon monoxide (metal carbonyls), cyanide, or carbide, 
> are generally considered to be organometallic as well.  
> 
> Some related compounds such as transition metal hydrides and metal phosphine complexes 
> are often included in discussions of organometallic compounds, 
> though strictly speaking, they are not necessarily organometallic. 
> 
> The related but distinct term "metalorganic compound" refers to metal-containing compounds 
> lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands.  
> 
> Metal Î²-diketonates, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and metal phosphine complexes 
> are representative members of this class.  
> The field of organometallic chemistry combines aspects of traditional [[Inorganic_Chemistry]] and [[Organic_Chemistry]] chemistry.
>
> Organometallic compounds are widely used both stoichiometrically in research and industrial chemical reactions, 
> as well as in the role of catalysts to increase the rates of such reactions (e.g., as in uses of homogeneous catalysis), 
> where target molecules include polymers, pharmaceuticals, and many other types of practical products.
