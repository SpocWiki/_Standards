## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The classical elements typically refer to earth, water, air, fire, and (later) aether 
> which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances. 
> Ancient cultures in Greece, Angola, Tibet, India, and Mali had similar lists 
> which sometimes referred, in local languages, to "air" as "wind", and to "aether" as "space".
>
> These different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations 
> concerning their attributes and how they related to observable phenomena as well as cosmology. 
> Sometimes these theories overlapped with mythology and were personified in deities. 
> Some of these interpretations included atomism (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter), 
> but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces 
> without changing their nature.
>
> While the classification of the material world in ancient India, Hellenistic Egypt, and ancient Greece 
> into air, earth, fire, and water was more philosophical, 
> during the Middle Ages medieval scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials. 
> In Europe, the ancient Greek concept, devised by Empedocles, 
> evolved into the systematic classifications of Aristotle and Hippocrates. 
> This evolved slightly into the medieval system, 
> and eventually became the object of experimental verification in the 17th century, 
> at the start of the Scientific Revolution.
>
> Modern science does not support the classical elements to classify types of substances. 
> Atomic theory classifies atoms into more than a hundred chemical elements 
> such as oxygen, iron, and mercury, which may form chemical compounds and mixtures. 
> 
> The modern categories roughly corresponding to the classical elements 
> are the states of matter produced under different temperatures and pressures. 
> 
> Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma share many attributes 
> with the corresponding classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire, 
> but these states describe the similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels, 
> not the characteristic behavior of certain atoms or substances.
