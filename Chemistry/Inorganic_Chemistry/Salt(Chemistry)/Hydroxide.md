## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hydroxide** is a diatomic anion with chemical formula OH−. 
> It consists of an oxygen and hydrogen atom held together by a single covalent bond, 
> and carries a negative electric charge. 
> It is an important but usually minor constituent of water. 
> 
> It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile, and a catalyst. 
> The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous solution, 
> liberating solvated hydroxide ions. 
> Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-ton per annum commodity chemical.
>
> The corresponding electrically neutral compound HO• is the hydroxyl radical. 
> The corresponding covalently bound group −OH of atoms is the hydroxy group.
>
> Both the hydroxide ion and hydroxy group are nucleophiles and can act as catalysts in organic chemistry.
>
> Many inorganic substances which bear the word hydroxide in their names 
> are not ionic compounds of the hydroxide ion, 
> but covalent compounds which contain hydroxy groups.
