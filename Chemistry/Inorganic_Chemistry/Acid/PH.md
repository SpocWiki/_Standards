> In chemistry, **PH** (pee-HAYCH or pee-AYCH) is a logarithmic scale 
> used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. 
> 
> Acidic solutions (solutions with higher concentrations of hydrogen (H+) cations) 
> are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions. 
> 
> While the origin of the symbol 'pH' can be traced back to its original inventor, 
> and the 'H' refers clearly to hydrogen, 
> the exact original meaning of the letter 'p' in pH is still disputed; 
> it has since acquired a more general technical meaning that is used in numerous other contexts.
>
> The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the activity of hydrogen cations in the solution
>           pH = − log(10, a H+) ≈ − lg([H+] / M)
> where [H+] is the equilibrium molar concentration of H+ (in M = mol/L) in the solution. 
> 
> At 25 °C (77 °F), solutions of which the pH is less than 7 are acidic, 
> and solutions of which the pH is greater than 7 are basic. 
> Solutions with a pH of 7 at 25 °C are neutral 
> (i.e. have the same concentration of H+ ions as OH− ions, i.e. the same as pure water). 
> 
> The neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature 
> and is lower than 7 if the temperature increases above 25 °C. 
> 
> The pH range is commonly given as zero to 14, but a pH value **can be less than 0** 
> for very concentrated strong acids or greater than 14 for very concentrated strong bases.
>
> The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions 
> whose pH is established by international agreement. 
> 
> Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference 
> by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode 
> such as the silver chloride electrode. 
> 
> The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a color-changing indicator 
> or a glass electrode and a pH meter. 
> 
> Measurements of pH are important in chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water treatment, and many other applications.
