## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Silicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum, 
> is a hard chemical compound containing silicon and carbon. 
> 
> A **wide bandgap semiconductor**, 
> it occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite, 
> but has been mass-produced as a powder and crystal since 1893 for use as an abrasive. 
> 
> Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, 
> such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. 
> Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method 
> and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite.
>
> Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
> and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. 
> SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures 
> or high voltages, or both.
