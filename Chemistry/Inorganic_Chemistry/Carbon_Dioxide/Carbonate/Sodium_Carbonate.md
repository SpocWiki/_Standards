> Sodium carbonate (also known as washing soda, soda ash, sal soda, and soda crystals) 
> is the inorganic compound with the formula Na2CO3 and its various hydrates. 
> 
> All forms are white, odorless, water-soluble salts that yield alkaline solutions in water. 
> Historically, it was extracted from the ashes of plants grown in sodium-rich soils, 
> and because the ashes of these sodium-rich plants were 
> noticeably different from ashes of wood (once used to produce potash), 
> sodium carbonate became known as "soda ash". 
> 
> It is produced in large quantities from sodium chloride and limestone 
> by the Solvay process, 
> as well as by carbonating sodium hydroxide which is made using the chloralkali process.
