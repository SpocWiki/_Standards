> In chemistry, hydrophobicity is the chemical property of a molecule (called a **Hydrophobe**) that is seemingly repelled from a mass of water. 
> In contrast, hydrophiles are attracted to water.
>
> Hydrophobic molecules tend to be nonpolar and, thus, 
> prefer other neutral molecules and nonpolar solvents. 
> 
> Because water molecules are polar, hydrophobes do not dissolve well among them. 
> Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together, forming micelles. 
> Water on hydrophobic surfaces will exhibit a high contact angle.
>
> Examples of hydrophobic molecules include the alkanes, oils, fats, and greasy substances in general. 
> Hydrophobic materials are used for oil removal from water, 
> the management of oil spills, and chemical separation processes 
> to remove non-polar substances from polar compounds. 
>
> The term hydrophobic—which comes from the Ancient Greek ὑδρόφοβος (hydróphobos), "having a fear of water", 
> constructed from Ancient Greek  ὕδωρ (húdōr) 'water' and Ancient Greek  φόβος (phóbos) 'fear'—
> is often used interchangeably with lipophilic, "fat-loving". 
> However, the two terms are not synonymous. 
> 
> While hydrophobic substances are usually lipophilic, 
> there are exceptions, such as the silicones and fluorocarbons.
