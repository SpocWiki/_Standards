> **Asbestos** ( ass-BES-təs) is a group of naturally occurring, toxic, carcinogenic and fibrous silicate minerals. 
> There are six types, all of which are composed of long and thin fibrous crystals, 
> each fibre (particulate with length substantially greater than width) 
> being composed of many microscopic "fibrils" 
> that can be released into the atmosphere by abrasion and other processes. 
> 
> Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various dangerous lung conditions, 
> including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer. 
> As a result of these health effects, asbestos is considered a serious health and safety hazard.
>
> Archaeological studies have found evidence of asbestos being used as far back as the Stone Age 
> to strengthen ceramic pots, but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century 
> when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. 
> 
> Asbestos is an excellent thermal and electrical insulator, and is highly fire-resistant, 
> so for much of the 20th century, it was very commonly used around the world 
> as a building material (particularly for its fire-retardant properties), 
> until its adverse effects on human health were more widely recognized and acknowledged in the 1970s. 
> Many buildings constructed before the 1980s contain asbestos.
>
> The use of asbestos for construction and fireproofing has been made illegal in many countries. 
> Despite this, around 255,000 people are thought to die each year from diseases related to asbestos exposure. 
> In part, this is because many older buildings still contain asbestos; 
> in addition, the consequences of exposure can take decades to arise. 
> 
> The latency period (from exposure until the diagnosis of negative health effects) is typically 20 years. 
> The most common diseases associated with chronic asbestos exposure are asbestosis 
> (scarring of the lungs due to asbestos inhalation) and mesothelioma (a type of cancer).
>
> Many developing countries still support the use of asbestos as a building material, 
> and mining of asbestos is ongoing, with the top producer, 
> Russia, having an estimated production of 790,000 tonnes in 2020.
