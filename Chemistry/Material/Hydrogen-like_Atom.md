> A hydrogen-like atom (or hydrogenic atom) is any atom or ion with a single valence electron. 
> These atoms are isoelectronic with hydrogen. 
> 
> Examples of hydrogen-like atoms include, but are not limited to, hydrogen itself, 
> all alkali metals such as Rb and Cs, singly ionized alkaline earth metals such as Ca+ and Sr+ and other ions such as He+, Li2+, and Be3+ and isotopes of any of the above. 
> 
> A hydrogen-like atom includes a positively charged core consisting of the atomic nucleus 
> and any core electrons as well as a single valence electron. 
> Because helium is common in the universe, the spectroscopy of singly ionized helium is important in EUV astronomy, for example, of DO white dwarf stars.
>
> The non-relativistic SchrÃ¶dinger equation and relativistic Dirac equation 
> for the hydrogen atom can be solved analytically, 
> owing to the simplicity of the two-particle physical system. 
> 
> The one-electron wave function solutions are referred to as hydrogen-like atomic orbitals. 
> Hydrogen-like atoms are of importance because their corresponding orbitals 
> bear similarity to the hydrogen atomic orbitals.
>
> Other systems may also be referred to as "hydrogen-like atoms", such as 
> - muonium (an electron orbiting an antimuon), 
> - positronium (an electron and a positron), 
> - certain exotic atoms (formed with other particles), 
> - or Rydberg atoms (in which one electron is in such a high energy state that it sees the rest of the atom effectively as a point charge).
