# [[Marble]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[WD~Marble,40861]] 

Marble is moderately hard, which makes for versatile Application, but gets very slippery when wet!

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Marble** is a metamorphic rock consisting of carbonate minerals 
> (most commonly calcite (CaCO³) or dolomite (CaMg(CO³)²) 
> that have recrystallized under the influence of heat and pressure. 
> It has a crystalline texture, and is typically not foliated (layered), although there are exceptions. 
>
> In geology, the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone, 
> but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone. 
>
> Pure white marble arises from very clean limestone or rock also called dolomite. 
> However, its signature veins and swirls result from impurities like clay, sand, iron oxides, 
> or chert originally present in the protolith—
> magnesium-rich varieties may show green tones due to serpentine. 
> These impurities are redistributed and recrystallized during metamorphism.  
>
> Because of its high hardness and strong wear resistance, 
> and because it will not be deformed by temperature, 
> marble is often used in sculpture and construction. 
> 
> In sculpture marble is ideal for fine detail due to its uniform grain, moderate hardness, 
> and ability to scatter light beneath the surface (**subsurface scattering**), 
> lending the sculpture a lifelike, **waxy appearance**. 
> 
> In architecture marble is valued for its polishable surface, hardness, and wear resistance. 
> In stonemasonry, "marble" may broadly include similar crystalline rocks, 
> even if not true geological marble.
>
> The extraction of marble is performed by quarrying. 
> Marble production is dominated by four countries: China, Italy, India and Spain, 
> which account for almost half of world production of marble and decorative stone.
