> In the context of the periodic table, a **Nonmetal** is a chemical element that mostly lacks distinctive metallic properties. They range from colorless gases like hydrogen to shiny crystals like iodine. Physically, they are usually lighter (less dense) than elements that form metals and are often poor conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically, nonmetals have relatively high electronegativity or usually attract electrons in a chemical bond with another element, and their oxides tend to be acidic.
>
> Seventeen elements are widely recognized as nonmetals. Additionally, some or all of six borderline elements (metalloids) are sometimes counted as nonmetals.
>
> The two lightest nonmetals, hydrogen and helium, together account for about 98% of the mass of the observable universe. Five nonmetallic elements—hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon—form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, crust and oceans, although metallic elements are believed to be slightly more than half of the overall composition of the Earth.
>
> Chemical compounds and alloys involving multiple elements including nonmetals are widespread. Industrial uses of nonmetals as the dominant component include in electronics, combustion, lubrication and machining.
>
> Most nonmetallic elements were identified in the 18th and 19th centuries. While a distinction between metals and other minerals had existed since antiquity, a classification of chemical elements as metallic or nonmetallic emerged only in the late 18th century. Since then about twenty properties have been suggested as criteria for distinguishing nonmetals from metals. In contemporary research usage it is common to use a distinction between metal and not-a-metal based upon the electronic structure of the solids; the elements carbon, arsenic and antimony are then semimetals, a subclass of metals. The rest of the nonmetallic elements are insulators, some of which such as silicon and germanium can readily accommodate dopants that change the electrical conductivity leading to semiconducting behavior.
