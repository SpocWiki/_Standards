## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Gasoline** (North American English) or petrol (Commonwealth English) 
> is a petrochemical product characterized as a transparent, yellowish and flammable liquid 
> normally used as a fuel for spark-ignited internal combustion engines. 
> 
> When formulated as a fuel for engines, gasoline is chemically composed of organic compounds 
> derived from the fractional distillation of petroleum 
> and later chemically enhanced with gasoline additives. 
> It is a high-volume profitable product produced in crude oil refineries.
>
> The ability of a particular gasoline blend to resist premature ignition 
> (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating. 
> Tetraethyl lead was once widely used to increase the octane rating 
> but is not used in modern automotive gasoline due to the health hazard. 
> 
> Aviation, off-road motor vehicles, and racing car engines still use leaded gasolines. 
> Other substances are frequently added to gasoline 
> to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosion, 
> and provide fuel system cleaning. 
> 
> Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as ethanol, MTBE, or ETBE to improve combustion.
