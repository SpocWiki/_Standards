> **Papyrus** ( pə-PY-rəs) is a material similar to thick paper 
> that was used in ancient times as a writing material. 
> 
> It was made from the pith of the papyrus plant, Cyperus papyrus, a wetland sedge. 
> 
> Papyrus (plural: papyri or papyruses) can also refer to a document 
> written on sheets of such material, joined side by side and rolled up into a scroll, 
> an early form of a book.
>
> Papyrus was first known to have been used in Egypt (at least as far back as the First Dynasty), 
> as the papyrus plant was once abundant across the Nile Delta. 
> 
> It was also used throughout the Mediterranean region. 
> Apart from writing material, 
> ancient Egyptians employed papyrus in the construction of other artifacts, such as 
> reed boats, mats, rope, sandals, and baskets.
