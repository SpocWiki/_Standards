> **Lumber**, also called timber in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, 
> is wood that has been processed into uniform and useful sizes (dimensional lumber), 
> including beams and planks or boards. 
> 
> Lumber is mainly used for construction framing, as well as finishing 
> (floors, wall panels, window frames). 
> 
> Lumber has many uses beyond home building. 
> In some parts of the world, including the United States and Canada, 
> the term timber refers specifically to unprocessed wood fiber, 
> such as cut logs or standing trees that have yet to be cut.
>
> Lumber may be supplied either rough-sawn, or surfaced on one or more of its faces. 
> Rough lumber is the raw material for furniture-making, and manufacture of other items requiring cutting and shaping. It is available in many species, including hardwoods and softwoods, such as white pine and red pine, because of their low cost.
>
> Finished lumber is supplied in standard sizes, mostly for the construction industry – primarily softwood, from coniferous species, including pine, fir and spruce (collectively spruce-pine-fir), cedar, and hemlock, but also some hardwood, for high-grade flooring. It is more commonly made from softwood than hardwoods, and 80% of lumber comes from softwood.
