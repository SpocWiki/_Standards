> **Chlorofluorocarbon**s (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) 
> are fully or partly halogenated hydrocarbons 
> that contain carbon (C), hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), and fluorine (F). 
> They are produced as volatile derivatives of methane, ethane, and propane.
>
> The most common example of a CFC is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12). 
> R-12, also commonly called Freon, is used as a refrigerant. 
> Many CFCs have been widely used as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), 
> gaseous fire suppression systems, and solvents. 
> 
> As a result of CFCs contributing to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, 
> the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, 
> and they are being replaced with other products such as [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) 
> and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) including R-410A, R-134a and R-1234yf.
