> **Methane** (US:  METH-ayn, UK:  MEE-thayn) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CH4 
> (one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms). 
> It is a group-14 hydride, the simplest alkane, and the main constituent of natural gas. 
> 
> The abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, 
> although capturing and storing it is difficult because it is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. 
> 
> In the Earth's atmosphere methane is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, 
> acting as a greenhouse gas. 
>
> Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor 
> and is formed by both geological and biological processes. 
> 
> The largest reservoir of methane is under the seafloor in the form of methane clathrates. 
> When methane reaches the surface and the atmosphere, it is known as atmospheric methane.
>
> The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 160% since 1750, 
> with the overwhelming percentage caused by human activity. 
> 
> It accounted for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases, 
> according to the 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. 
> 
> Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions could limit near-term warming 
> and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone.
>
> Methane has also been detected on other planets, including Mars, which has implications for astrobiology research.
