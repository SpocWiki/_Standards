> **Benzene** is an organic chemical compound with the molecular formula C6H6. 
> The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms 
> joined in a planar hexagonal ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. 
> Because it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon.
>
> Benzene is a natural constituent of petroleum and is one of the elementary petrochemicals. 
> Due to the cyclic continuous pi bonds between the carbon atoms 
> and satisfying HÃ¼ckel's rule, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon. 
> 
> Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, 
> and is partially responsible for the aroma of gasoline. 
> It is used primarily as a precursor 
> to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structures, 
> such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced annually. 
> 
> Although benzene is a major industrial chemical, 
> it finds limited use in consumer items because of its toxicity. 
> Benzene is a volatile organic compound.
>
> Benzene is classified as a carcinogen. 
> Its particular effects on human health, such as the long-term results of accidental exposure, 
> have been reported on by news organizations such as The New York Times. 
> 
> For instance, a 2022 article stated 
> that benzene contamination in the Boston metropolitan area 
> caused hazardous conditions in multiple places, 
> with the publication noting that the compound 
> may eventually cause leukemia in some individuals.
