> **Dopamine** (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) 
> is a neuromodulatory molecule that plays several important roles in cells. 
> 
> It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. 
> Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. 
> It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, 
> which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. 
> 
> Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. 
> In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitterâ€”a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) 
> to send signals to other nerve cells. 
> 
> Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain but affect many regions systemically. 
> The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, 
> one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. 
> 
> The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, 
> and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. 
> 
> Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. 
> These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.
>
> In popular culture and media, dopamine is often portrayed as the main chemical of pleasure, 
> but the current opinion in pharmacology is that __dopamine instead confers motivational salience__; 
> dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, 
> which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.
>
> Outside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a __local paracrine messenger__. 
> - In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; 
> - in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; 
> - in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; 
> - in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; 
> - and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. 
> With the (natural) exception of the blood vessels, 
> dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.
>
> Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, 
> and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. 
> 
> Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, 
> is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. 
> Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; Levodopa, a pure form of L-DOPA, 
> is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's. 
> 
> There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, 
> and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. 
> 
> Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. 
> Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
> are associated with decreased dopamine activity. 
> 
> Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. 
> 
> It is useful in the treatment of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock. 
> In newborn babies it may be used for hypotension and septic shock.
>
> Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection.
