## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In classical physics and general chemistry, 
> matter is any **Substance** that has mass and takes up space by having volume. 
> 
> All everyday objects that can be touched are ultimately composed of atoms, 
> which are made up of interacting subatomic particles. 
> In everyday as well as scientific usage, matter generally includes atoms and anything made up of them, 
> and any particles (or combination of particles) that act as if they have both rest mass and volume. 
> 
> However it does not include massless particles such as photons, 
> or other energy phenomena or waves such as light or heat. 
> Matter exists in various states (also known as phases). 
> These include classical everyday phases such as solid, liquid, and gas – 
> for example water exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – 
> but other states are possible, including plasma, Bose–Einstein condensates, fermionic condensates, 
> and quark–gluon plasma.
>
> Usually atoms can be imagined as a nucleus of protons and neutrons, 
> and a surrounding "cloud" of orbiting electrons which "take up space". 
> However, this is only somewhat correct 
> because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their quantum nature, 
> which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like waves as well as particles, 
> and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. 
> 
> In the Standard Model of particle physics, matter is not a fundamental concept 
> because the elementary constituents of atoms are quantum entities 
> which do not have an inherent "size" or "volume" in any everyday sense of the word. 
> 
> Due to the exclusion principle and other fundamental interactions, 
> some "point particles" known as fermions (quarks, leptons), and many composites and atoms, 
> are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; 
> this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space.
>
> For much of the history of the natural sciences, people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. 
> The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called particulate theory of matter, 
> appeared in both ancient Greece and ancient India. 
> 
> Early philosophers who proposed the particulate theory of matter include 
> - the Indian philosopher Kaṇāda (c. 6th century BCE), and 
> - the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Leucippus (c. 490 BCE) and Democritus (c. 470–380 BCE).
