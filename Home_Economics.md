## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Home Economics**, also called domestic science or family and consumer sciences 
> (often shortened to FCS or FACS), is a subject concerning human development, 
> personal and family finances, consumer issues, housing and interior design, 
> nutrition and food preparation, as well as textiles and apparel. 
> 
> Although historically mostly taught in secondary school or high school, 
> dedicated home economics courses are much less common today.
>
> Home economics courses are offered around the world and across multiple educational levels. 
> Historically, the purpose of these courses was to professionalize housework, 
> to provide intellectual fulfillment for women, to emphasize the value of "women's work" in society, 
> and to prepare them for the traditional roles of sexes. 
> 
> Family and consumer sciences are taught as an elective or required course in secondary education, 
> as a continuing education course in institutions, and at the primary level.  
>
> Beginning in Scotland in the 1850s, it was a woman-dominated course, teaching women to be homemakers with sewing being the lead skill. The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences at the beginning of the 20th century saw Americans desiring youth to learn vocational skills as well. Politics played a role in home economics education, and it wasn't until later in the century that the course shifted from being woman-dominated to now required for both sexes.  
>
> Now family and consumer science have been included in the broader subject of Career Technical Education, a program that teaches skilled trades, applied sciences, modern technologies, and career preparation.  Despite the widening of the subject matter over the past century, there has been a major decline in home economics courses offered by educational institutions.
