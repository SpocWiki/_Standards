> **Inorganic Chemistry** deals with synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds. 
> 
> This field covers chemical compounds that are not carbon-based, which are the subjects of organic chemistry. 
> 
> The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, 
> as there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of [[organoMetallic]] chemistry. 
> 
> It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, 
> including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.
