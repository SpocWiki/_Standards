the RIC is aligned with the EU [[Recycling_codes]]. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Resin identification code** (RIC) is a technical standard 
> with a set of symbols appearing on plastic products 
> that identify the plastic resin out of which the product is made. 
> 
> It was developed in 1988 by the Society of the Plastics Industry 
> (now the Plastics Industry Association) in the United States, 
> but since 2008 it has been administered by ASTM International, an international standards organization.
>
> Due to resemblance to the recycling symbol, RIC symbols are often mistaken for the former. 
> Subsequent revisions to the RIC have replaced the arrows with a solid triangle, 
> but the old symbols are still in common use.
