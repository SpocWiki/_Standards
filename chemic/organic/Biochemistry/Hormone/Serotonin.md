> **Serotonin** () or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. 
> Its biological function is complex, touching on diverse functions including mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, 
> and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction.
>
> Serotonin is produced in the central nervous system (CNS), 
> specifically in the brainstem's raphe nuclei, the skin's Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells 
> and the tongue's taste receptor cells. 
> 
> Approximately 90% of the serotonin the human body produces is in the gastrointestinal tract's enterochromaffin cells, 
> where it regulates intestinal movements. 
> 
> Additionally, it is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction, 
> where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets. About 8% is found in platelets and 1–2% in the CNS.
>
> The serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally, 
> which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, 
> which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. 
> 
> The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, 
> where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.
>
> Serotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. 
> There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. 
> When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, 
> where it can serve as a vasoconstrictor or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. 
> 
> In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor 
> by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly 
> or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II and norepinephrine). 
> 
> The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium – 
> such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. 
> 
> In normal physiologic states, vasodilation occurs 
> through the serotonin-mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells, 
> and the inhibition of release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. 
> 
> Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. 
> There are various serotonin receptors.
>
> Biochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan. 
> Serotonin is metabolized mainly to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), chiefly by the liver.
>
> Several classes of antidepressants, 
> such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
> and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), 
> interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal, 
> therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses.
>
> Besides mammals, __serotonin is found in all bilateral animals__ 
> including worms and insects, as well as in fungi and in plants. 
> 
> Serotonin's presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain, 
> which is a side-effect of serotonin injection. 
> 
> Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, causing diarrhea in the human gut. 
> Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to stimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.
