## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Estrogen** (also spelled oestrogen in British English) is a category of sex hormone 
> responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system 
> and secondary sex characteristics. 
> 
> There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: 
> - estrone (E1), 
> - estradiol (E2), and 
> - estriol (E3). Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent. 
> - Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy.
>
> Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates and some insects. 
> Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women. 
> While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, 
> estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males.
>
> Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. 
> Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs) 
> which in turn modulate the expression of many genes. 
> Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), 
> such as GPER (GPR30).
>
> In addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as medications, 
> for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, hormonal birth control 
> and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, intersex people, and nonbinary people.
>
> Synthetic and natural estrogens have been found in the environment 
> and are referred to as xenoestrogens. 
> 
> Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) 
> and can cause health issues and reproductive disfunction in both wildlife and humans.
