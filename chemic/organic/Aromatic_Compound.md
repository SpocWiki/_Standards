## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Aromatic compounds or arenes are organic compounds 
> "with a chemistry typified by benzene" and "cyclically conjugated."
>
> The word "aromatic" originates from the past grouping of molecules based on odor, 
> before their general chemical properties were understood. 
> 
> The current definition of aromatic compounds does not have any relation to their odor. 
> Aromatic compounds are now defined as cyclic compounds satisfying HÃ¼ckel's rule.
>
> Aromatic compounds have the following general properties:
> - Typically unreactive 
> - Often non polar and hydrophobic 
> - High carbon-hydrogen ratio 
> - Burn with a strong sooty yellow flame, due to high C:H ratio 
> - Undergo electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions 
>
> Arenes are typically split into two categories 
> - benzoids, that contain a benzene derivative and follow the benzene ring model, and 
> - non-benzoids that contain other aromatic cyclic derivatives. 
> 
> Aromatic compounds are commonly used in organic synthesis and are involved in many reaction types, 
> following both additions and removals, as well as saturation and dearomatization.
