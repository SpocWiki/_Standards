> Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is an acidic, colourless liquid 
> and organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H, C2H4O2, or HC2H3O2). 
> 
> Vinegar is at least 4% acetic acid by volume, 
> making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Historically, vinegar was produced from the third century BC and was likely the first acid to be produced in large quantities.
>
> Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). 
> It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical across various fields, 
> used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, 
> polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. 
> 
> In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. 
> In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 
> as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. 
> 
> In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. 
> When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.
>
> The global demand for acetic acid as of 2023 is about 17.88 million metric tonnes per year (t/a). Most of the world's acetic acid is produced via the carbonylation of methanol. Its production and subsequent industrial use poses health hazards to workers, including incidental skin damage and chronic respiratory injuries from inhalation.
