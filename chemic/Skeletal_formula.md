> The **Skeletal formula**, line-angle formula, bond-line formula 
> or shorthand formula of an organic compound is a type of minimalist structural formula 
> representing a molecule's atoms, bonds and some details of its geometry. 
> 
> The lines in a skeletal formula represent bonds between carbon atoms, 
> unless  labelled with another element. 
> Labels are optional for carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms attached to them.
>
> An early form of this representation was first developed by organic chemist August Kekulé, 
> while the modern form is closely related to and influenced by the 
> Lewis structure of molecules and their valence electrons. 
> Hence they are sometimes termed Kekulé structures or Lewis–Kekulé structures.  
> 
> Skeletal formulas have become ubiquitous in organic chemistry, 
> partly because they are relatively quick and simple to draw, 
> and also because the curved arrow notation used for discussions of reaction mechanisms 
> and electron delocalization can be readily superimposed.  
>
> Several other ways of depicting chemical structures are also commonly used in organic chemistry 
> (though less frequently than skeletal formulae).  
> For example, conformational structures look similar to skeletal formulae 
> and are used to depict the approximate positions of atoms in 3D space, as a perspective drawing.  
> 
> Other types of representation, such as Newman projection, Haworth projection 
> or Fischer projection, also look somewhat similar to skeletal formulae. 
> However, there are slight differences in the conventions used, and the reader 
> needs to be aware of them in order to understand the structural details encoded in the depiction. 
> 
> Skeletal and conformational structures are also used in organometallic and inorganic chemistry.
