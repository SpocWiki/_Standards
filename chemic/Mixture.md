## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In chemistry, a **Mixture** is a material made up of two or more different chemical substances 
> which can be separated by physical method. 
> 
> It is an impure substance made up of 2 or more elements or compounds 
> mechanically mixed together in any proportion. 
> 
> A mixture is the physical combination of two or more substances in which the identities are retained 
> and are mixed in the form of solutions, suspensions or colloids.
>
> Mixtures are one product of mechanically blending or mixing chemical substances 
> such as elements and compounds, without chemical bonding or other chemical change, 
> so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup. 
> 
> Despite the fact that there are no chemical changes to its constituents, 
> the physical properties of a mixture, such as its melting point, may differ from those of the components. 
> 
> Some mixtures can be separated into their components by using physical (mechanical or thermal) means. 
> Azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually poses considerable difficulties 
> regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents 
> (physical or chemical processes or, even a blend of them).
