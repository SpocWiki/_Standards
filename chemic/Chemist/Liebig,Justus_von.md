> Justus Freiherr von Liebig (12 May 1803 – 18 April 1873) was a German scientist 
> who made major contributions to agricultural and biological chemistry, 
> and is considered one of the principal founders of organic chemistry. 
> 
> As a professor at the University of Giessen, he devised the modern laboratory-oriented teaching method, 
> and for such innovations, he is regarded as one of the greatest chemistry teachers of all time. 
> 
> He has been described as the "father of the fertilizer industry" 
> for his emphasis on nitrogen and trace minerals as essential plant nutrients, 
> and his formulation of the law of the minimum, 
> which described how plant growth relied on the scarcest nutrient resource, 
> rather than the total amount of resources available. 
> 
> He also developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts, and with his consent 
> a company, called Liebig Extract of Meat Company, was founded to exploit the concept; 
> it later introduced the Oxo brand beef bouillon cube.
