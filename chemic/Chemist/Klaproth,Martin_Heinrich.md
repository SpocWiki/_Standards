> Klaproth was a major systematizer of analytical chemistry, 
> and an independent inventor of gravimetric analysis. 
> His attention to detail and refusal to ignore discrepancies in results 
> led to improvements in the use of apparatus.  
> He was a major figure in understanding the composition of minerals and characterizing the elements.
