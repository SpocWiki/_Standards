## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Lead** is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::Pb) (from the Latin plumbum) and atomic number (Charge-e::82). 
> It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. 
> Lead is soft and malleable, and also has a relatively low melting point. 
> 
> When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. 
> It tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. 
> 
> Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element 
> and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements. 
> 
> Lead is toxic, even in small amounts, especially to children.
>
> Lead is a relatively unreactive post-transition metal. 
> Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; 
> lead and lead oxides react with both acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. 
> 
> Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state 
> rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. 
> 
> Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. 
> Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; 
> it can form chains and polyhedral structures.
>
> Since lead is easily extracted from its ores, prehistoric people in the Near East were aware of it. 
> Galena is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver. 
> Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome. 
> Lead production declined after the fall of Rome 
> and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. 
> 
> Lead played a crucial role in the development of the printing press, 
> as movable type could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys. 
> 
> In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, 
> over half of which was from recycling. 
> 
> Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. 
> These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, 
> resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.
>
> Lead's toxicity became widely recognized in the late 19th century, 
> although a number of well-educated __ancient Greek and Roman writers were aware of this fact__ 
> and even knew some of the symptoms of lead poisoning. 
> 
> Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones; 
> it damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of biological enzymes, 
> causing neurological disorders ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, 
> and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems.

Due to the large Silver Refining in the Roman Empire, it is likely that it was detrimental to general health.
