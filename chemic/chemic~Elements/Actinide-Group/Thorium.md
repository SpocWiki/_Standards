## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Thorium** is a chemical element; it has symbol Th and atomic number 90. 
> Thorium is a weakly radioactive light silver metal which tarnishes olive grey when it is exposed to air, 
> forming thorium dioxide; it is moderately soft, malleable, and has a high melting point. 
> Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state; 
> it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.
>
> All known thorium isotopes are unstable. 
> The most stable isotope, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.05 billion years, or about the age of the universe; 
> it decays very slowly via alpha decay, 
> starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb. 
> 
> On Earth, thorium and uranium are the only elements with no stable or nearly-stable isotopes 
> that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. 
> Thorium is estimated to be over three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust, 
> and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth elements.
>
> Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark 
> and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, 
> who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder and war, because of its power. 
> 
> Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. 
> Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. 
> In the second half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses 
> due to concerns about its radioactivity.
>
> Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in TIG welding electrodes 
> but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. 
> 
> It was also material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, 
> used in some broadcast vacuum tubes, and as the light source in gas mantles, 
> but these uses have become marginal. 
> 
> It has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, 
> and several thorium reactors have been built. 
> 
> Thorium is also used in strengthening magnesium, 
> coating tungsten wire in electrical and welding equipment, 
> controlling the grain size of tungsten in electric lamps, high-temperature crucibles, 
> and glasses including camera and scientific instrument lenses. 
> 
> Other uses for thorium include heat-resistant ceramics, aircraft engines, and in light bulbs. 
> Ocean science has utilised 231Pa/230Th isotope ratios to understand the ancient ocean.
