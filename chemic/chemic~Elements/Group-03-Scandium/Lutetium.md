> **Lutetium** is a chemical element; it has symbol Lu and atomic number 71. 
> It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, but not in moist air. 
> Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series, 
> and it is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements; 
> it can also be classified as the first element of the 6th-period transition metals.
>
> Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, 
> Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. 
> All of these researchers found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, 
> which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium and oxygen. 
> 
> The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, 
> with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results 
> influenced by the published research of the other; 
> the naming honor went to Urbain, as he had published his results earlier. 
> 
> He chose the name lutecium for the new element, but in 1949 the spelling was changed to lutetium. 
> In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; 
> however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 
> proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s.
>
> Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element, 
> although it is significantly more common than silver in the Earth's crust. It has few specific uses. 
> Lutetium-176 is a relatively abundant (2.5%) radioactive isotope 
> with a half-life of about 38 billion years, used to determine the age of minerals and meteorites. 
> 
> Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium 
> and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. 
> 
> 177Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy on neuroendocrine tumours. 
> (see Nuclear medicine) 
> 
> Lutetium has the highest Brinell hardness of any lanthanide, at 890–1300 MPa.
