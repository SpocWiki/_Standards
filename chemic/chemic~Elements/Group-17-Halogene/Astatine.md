## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> **Astatine** is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::At) and atomic number (Charge-e::85). 
> It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust, 
> occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. 
> All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. 
> A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, 
> because any macroscopic specimen 
> would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.
>
> The bulk properties of astatine are not known with certainty. 
> Many of them have been estimated from the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, and a member of the halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). However, astatine also falls roughly along the dividing line between metals and nonmetals, and some metallic behavior has also been observed and predicted for it. Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine, but it also sometimes displays metallic characteristics and shows some similarities to silver.

> The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio G. Segrè at the University of California, Berkeley, who named it from the Ancient Greek ἄστατος (astatos) 'unstable'. Four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found to be naturally occurring, although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding bismuth-209 with alpha particles.
