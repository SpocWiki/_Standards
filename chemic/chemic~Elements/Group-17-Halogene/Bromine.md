## #has_/text_of_/abstract 


> **Bromine** is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::Br) and atomic number (Charge-e::35). 
> It is a volatile red-brown liquid at room temperature 
> that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured vapour. 
> 
> Its properties are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. 
> Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) 
> and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), 
> its name was derived from the Ancient Greek βρῶμος (bromos) meaning "stench", 
> referring to its sharp and pungent smell.
>
> Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur as a native element in nature 
> but it occurs in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. 
> In fact, bromine and all the halogens are so reactive that they form bonds in pairs—
> never in single atoms. 
> 
> While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) 
> has caused its accumulation in the oceans. 
> Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine evaporation ponds, 
> mostly in the United States and Israel. 
> The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.
>
> At standard conditions for temperature and pressure it is a liquid; 
> the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is mercury. 
> 
> At high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, 
> a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions. 
> This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants, 
> and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. 
> The same property causes ultraviolet sunlight 
> to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms, 
> causing ozone depletion. 
> 
> As a result, many organobromine compounds—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—
> are no longer used. 
> 
> Bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, 
> and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals.
>
> Large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ions, causing bromism. However, a clear biological role for bromide ions and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated, and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans. The role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.
