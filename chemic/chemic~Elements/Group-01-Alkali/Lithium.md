> **Lithium** (from Greek: λίθος, romanized: lithos, lit. 'stone') 
> is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. 
> Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. 
> 
> Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, 
> inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. 
> 
> When cut, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, 
> then black tarnish. 
> 
> It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals, 
> which were once the main source of lithium. 
> 
> Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. 
> Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.
>
> The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, 
> since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature 
> have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. 
> Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system 
> than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: 
> it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. 
> 
> For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. 
> The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, 
> and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons. 
> 
> Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, 
> including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, 
> steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. 
> These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.
>
> Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts; its functions are uncertain. 
> Lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood stabilizer 
> and antidepressant in the treatment of mental illness such as bipolar disorder.
