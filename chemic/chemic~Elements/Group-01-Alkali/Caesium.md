> **Caesium** (IUPAC spelling) (or cesium in American English) 
> is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::Cs) and atomic number (Charge-e::55). 
> 
> It is a soft, silvery-golden alkali metal with a melting point of [MeltingPoint-C::28.4] °C (83.3 °F), 
> which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. 
> 
> Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. 
> It is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at −116 °C (−177 °F). 
> 
> It is the least electronegative element, with a value of [Electronegative::0.79] on the Pauling scale. 
> It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. 
> 
> Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite. 
> The element has 40 known isotopes, making it, along with barium and mercury, 
> one of the elements with the most isotopes. Caesium-137, 
> a fission product, is extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.

> The German chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "getter" in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells. In 1967, acting on Einstein's proof that the speed of light is the most-constant dimension in the universe, the International System of Units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium-133 to co-define the second and the metre. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks.

> Since the 1990s, the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids, 
> but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. 
> 
> The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years 
> and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. 
> 
> Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic, 
> but the pure metal's tendency to react explosively with water means that 
> caesium is considered a hazardous material, 
> and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.
