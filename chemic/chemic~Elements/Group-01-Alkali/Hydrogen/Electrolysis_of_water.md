## Challenges 

### Corrosion 

Use non-corrosive Electrodes from [[../../Group-10-Nickel/Platinum]] or [[../../Group-09-Cobalt/Iridium]]
use an alkaline rather than a sour Electrolyte allows to use [[../../Group-10-Nickel/Nickel]]. 


### Efficiency 

Both Electrolysis and [[Fuel_Cell]] / Electrochemical Combustion create excess heat, reducing their Efficiency.

### Storage 

To efficiently store Hydrogen you need to pressurize it. 
Instead of mechanical pressure, you can just create the 
### Separation of Oxygen and Hydrogen 

Use a Membrane to avoid contamination, which could lead to an explosive Mixture. 
Rather vent some Hydrogen, reducing [[#Efficiency]].

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Electrolysis of water is 
> using electricity to split water into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) gas by electrolysis. 
> 
> Hydrogen gas released in this way can be used as hydrogen fuel, 
> but must be kept apart from the oxygen as the mixture would be extremely explosive.  
> Separately pressurised into convenient 'tanks' or 'gas bottles', 
> hydrogen can be used for oxyhydrogen  welding and other applications, 
> as the hydrogen / oxygen flame can reach approximately 2,800°C.
>
> Water electrolysis requires a minimum potential difference of 1.23 volts, 
> although at that voltage external heat is also required.  
> Typically 1.5 volts is required. 
> 
> Electrolysis is rare in industrial applications 
> since hydrogen can be produced less expensively from fossil fuels. 
> 
> Most of the time, hydrogen is made by splitting methane (CH4) into carbon dioxide (CO2) 
> and hydrogen (H2) via steam reforming. 
> 
> This is a carbon-intensive process that means for every kilogram of “grey” hydrogen produced, 
> approximately 10 kilograms of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere.
