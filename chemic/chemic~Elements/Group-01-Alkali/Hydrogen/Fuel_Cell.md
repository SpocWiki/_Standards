> A **Fuel Cell** is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of a fuel (often hydrogen) 
> and an oxidizing agent (often oxygen) into electricity through a pair of redox reactions. 
> 
> Fuel cells are different from most batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen 
> (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, 
> whereas in a battery the chemical energy usually comes 
> from substances that are already present in the battery. 
> Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.

> The first fuel cells were invented by Sir William Grove in 1838. 
> The first commercial use of fuel cells came almost a century later 
> following the invention of the hydrogenâ€“oxygen fuel cell by Francis Thomas Bacon in 1932.

Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in start-up time ranging from 1 second for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). A related technology is flow batteries, in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are "stacked", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements. In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water vapor, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. PEMFC cells generally produce fewer nitrogen oxides than SOFC cells: they operate at lower temperatures, use hydrogen as fuel, and limit the diffusion of nitrogen into the anode via the proton exchange membrane, which forms NOx. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40 and 60%; however, if waste heat is captured in a cogeneration scheme, efficiencies of up to 85% can be obtained.
