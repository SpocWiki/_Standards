> **Platinum** is a chemical element with the symbol (Abbr::Pt) and atomic number (Charge-e::78). 
> It is a dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, precious, silverish-white transition metal. 
> Its name originates from Spanish platina, a diminutive of plata "silver".
> 
> Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements 
> and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. 
> 
> It has six naturally occurring isotopes. 
> It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5 μg/kg. 
> It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, 
> mostly in South Africa, which accounts for ~80% of the world production. 
> Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, 
> and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.
> 
> Platinum is one of the least reactive metals. 
> It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, 
> and is therefore considered a noble metal. 
> Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. 
> Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, 
> it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. 
> 
> It was referenced in European writings as early as the 16th century, 
> but it was not until Antonio de Ulloa published a report on 
> a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.
>
> Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, 
> platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. 
> 
> Platinum is used in the glass industry to manipulate molten glass which does not "wet" platinum. 
> 
> As a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; 
> but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. 
> Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, 
> are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer. 
> 
> Pure platinum is currently less expensive than pure gold, having been so continuously since 2015, 
> but has been twice as expensive or more, mostly prior to 2008. 
> In early 2021, the value of platinum ranged from US$1,055 to US$1,320 per troy ounce.
