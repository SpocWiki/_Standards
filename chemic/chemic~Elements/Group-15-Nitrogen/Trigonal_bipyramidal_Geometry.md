> In chemistry, a trigonal bipyramid formation is a molecular geometry with 
> - 1 atom at the center 
> - 3 atomes in the plane and 
> - 2 more atoms at the 2 Tips of the triangular bipyramid. 
> 
> This is one geometry for which the bond angles surrounding the central atom are not identical 
> (see also pentagonal bipyramid), 
> because there is no geometrical arrangement with five terminal atoms in equivalent positions. 
> Examples of this molecular geometry are phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5), 
> and phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) in the gas phase.
