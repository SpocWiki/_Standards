> In chemistry, trigonal planar is a molecular geometry model with 
> - 1 atom at the center and 
> - 3 atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle, called peripheral atoms, 
> all in one plane. 
> 
> In an ideal trigonal planar species, all three ligands are identical and all bond angles are 120°. 
> Such species belong to the point group D3h. 
> 
> Examples of molecules with trigonal planar geometry include boron trifluoride (BF3), 
> formaldehyde (H2CO), phosgene (COCl2), and sulfur trioxide (SO3). 
> 
> Some ions with trigonal planar geometry include nitrate (NO−3), carbonate (CO2−3), 
> and guanidinium (C(NH2)+3). 
> In organic chemistry, planar, three-connected carbon centers that are trigonal planar 
> are often described as having [[sp2-hybridization]].
>
> Molecules where the three ligands are not identical, such as H2C=O, 
> deviate from this idealized geometry. 
> 
> Nitrogen inversion is the distortion of pyramidal amines through a transition state that is trigonal planar.
>
> Pyramidalization is a distortion of this molecular shape towards a tetrahedral molecular geometry. 
> One way to observe this distortion is in pyramidal alkenes.
