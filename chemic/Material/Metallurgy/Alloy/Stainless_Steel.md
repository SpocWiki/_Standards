## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Stainless steel**, also known as inox, corrosion-resistant steel (CRES), and rustless steel, is an  
> iron-based alloy containing a minimum level of chromium that is resistant to rusting and corrosion. 
> Stainless steel's resistance to corrosion results from the 10.5%, or more, chromium content 
> which forms a passive film that can protect the material and self-heal in the presence of oxygen.â€Š 
> 
> It can also be alloyed with other elements such as molybdenum, carbon, nickel and nitrogen 
> to develop a range of different properties depending on its specific use. 
>
> The alloy's properties, such as luster and resistance to corrosion, are useful in many applications. 
> Stainless steel can be rolled into sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing.  
> These can be used in cookware, cutlery, surgical instruments, major appliances, vehicles, 
> construction material in large buildings, industrial equipment (e.g., in paper mills, chemical plants, 
> water treatment), and storage tanks and tankers for chemicals and food products. 
> Some grades are also suitable for forging and casting.
>
> The biological cleanability of stainless steel is superior to both aluminium and copper, 
> and comparable to glass. Its cleanability, strength, and corrosion resistance 
> have prompted the use of stainless steel in pharmaceutical and food processing plants.
>
> Different types of stainless steel are labeled with an AISI three-digit number. 
> The ISO 15510 standard lists the chemical compositions of stainless steels of the specifications 
> in existing ISO, ASTM, EN, JIS, and GB standards in a useful interchange table.
