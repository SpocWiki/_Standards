## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Alloy** is a mixture of chemical elements of which in most cases at least one is a metallic element, 
> although it is also sometimes used for mixtures of elements; herein only metallic alloys are described. 
> 
> Most alloys are metallic and show good electrical conductivity, ductility, opacity, and luster, 
> and may have properties that differ from those of the pure elements 
> such as increased strength or hardness. In some cases.
> An alloy may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. 
> In other cases, the mixture imparts synergistic properties 
> such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength.
>
> In an alloy, the atoms are joined by metallic bonding 
> rather than by covalent bonds typically found in chemical compounds. 
> 
> The alloy constituents are usually measured by __mass percentage__ for practical applications, 
> and in atomic fraction for basic science studies. 
> 
> Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys, 
> depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. 
> 
> They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), 
> or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or intermetallic. 
> 
> An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements 
> (a single phase, where all metallic grains (crystals) are of the same composition) 
> or a mixture of metallic phases 
> (two or more solutions, forming a microstructure of different crystals within the metal).
>
> Examples of alloys include red gold (gold and copper), white gold (gold and silver), 
> sterling silver (silver and copper), 
> steel or silicon steel (iron with non-metallic carbon or silicon respectively), 
> solder, brass, pewter, duralumin, bronze, and amalgams.
>
> Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications, from the steel alloys, used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools, to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry, to beryllium-copper alloys for non-sparking tools.
