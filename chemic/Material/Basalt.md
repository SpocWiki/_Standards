> **Basalt** (UK: ; US: ) is an aphanitic (fine-grained) extrusive igneous rock 
> formed from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron (mafic lava) 
> exposed at or very near the surface of a rocky planet or moon. 
> 
> More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt. 
> Rapid-cooling, fine-grained basalt has the same chemical composition and mineralogy 
> as slow-cooling, coarse-grained gabbro. 
> 
> The eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year. 
> Basalt is also an important rock type on other planetary bodies in the Solar System. 
> For example, the bulk of the plains of Venus, which cover ~80% of the surface, are basaltic; 
> the lunar maria are plains of flood-basaltic lava flows; 
> and basalt is a common rock on the surface of Mars.
>
> Molten basalt lava has a low viscosity due to its relatively low silica content 
> (between 45% and 52%), resulting in rapidly moving lava flows 
> that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidifying. 
> Flood basalts are thick sequences of many such flows 
> that can cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometres 
> and constitute the most voluminous of all volcanic formations.
>
> Basaltic magmas within Earth are thought to originate from the upper mantle. 
> The chemistry of basalts thus provides clues to processes deep in Earth's interior.
