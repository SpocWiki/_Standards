# [[Molecule]] 


> A **Molecule** is a group of two or more atoms held together by attractive forces known as chemical bonds. 
> Depending on context, the term may or may not include ions which satisfy this criterion. 
> In quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the distinction from ions is dropped 
> and molecule is often used when referring to polyatomic ions.
>
> A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, 
> e.g. two atoms in the oxygen molecule (O2); 
> or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, 
> e.g. water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; H2O). 
> 
> In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle 
> regardless of its composition. This relaxes the requirement that a molecule contains two or more atoms, 
> since the noble gases are individual atoms. 
> 
> Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent interactions, 
> such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are typically not considered single molecules. 
> 
> Concepts similar to molecules have been discussed since ancient times, 
> but modern investigation into the nature of molecules and their bonds began in the 17th century. 
> Refined over time by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Amedeo Avogadro, Jean Perrin, and Linus Pauling, 
> the study of molecules is today known as molecular physics or molecular chemistry.
