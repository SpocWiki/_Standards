## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> A **Metal** (from Ancient Greek  μέταλλον (métallon) 'mine, quarry, metal') 
> is a material that, when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, 
> and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. 
> 
> These properties are all associated with having electrons available at the Fermi level, 
> as against nonmetallic materials which do not. 
> Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets).
>
> A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; 
> or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride. 
> 
> The general science of metals is called metallurgy, a subtopic of materials science; 
> aspects of the electronic and thermal properties 
> are also within the scope of condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry, it is a multidisciplinary topic. 
> In colloquial use materials such as steel alloys are referred to as metals, 
> while others such as polymers, wood or ceramics are nonmetallic materials.
>
> A metal conducts electricity at a temperature of absolute zero, 
> which is a consequence of delocalized states at the Fermi energy. 
> 
> Many elements and compounds become metallic under high pressures, for example, 
> iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. 
> Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, 
> and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.
>
> When discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used 
> to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions 
> are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above.  
> 
> The related term metallic may also be used for types of dopant atoms or alloying elements.
>
> In astronomy metal refers to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium. 
> In this sense the first four "metals" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis 
> are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. 
> A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. 
> The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.
>
> The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, 
> for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, 
> as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. 
> 
> Precious metals were historically used as coinage, 
> but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. 
> 
> There is also extensive use of multi-element metals such as titanium nitride 
> or degenerate semiconductors in the semiconductor industry.
>
> The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. 
> 
> Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use 
> before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. 
> 
> Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; 
> the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; 
> and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.
