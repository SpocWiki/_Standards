> Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a III-V direct band gap semiconductor 
> with a zinc blende crystal structure.
>
> Gallium arsenide is used in the manufacture of devices such as 
> - microwave frequency integrated circuits, 
> - monolithic microwave integrated circuits, 
> - infrared light-emitting diodes, 
> - laser diodes, 
> - solar cells and 
> - optical windows.
>
> GaAs is often used as a substrate material for the epitaxial growth of other III-V semiconductors, 
> including indium gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide and others.
