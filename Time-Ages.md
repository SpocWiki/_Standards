Describes the Earth Eons and Ages down to the Events of the Human Era, the [[Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~3~Cenozoic/Period~3~Quaternary/Epoch~3~Anthropocene|Epoch~3~Anthropocene]]. 
Geographically localized Events may be described in the Sub-Sections of [[Earth]]. 
But different geographical Configurations of Earth's Surface are described here. 

This follows the logic to provide intuitive access to content relevant to the current time and location, 
but putting it into a greater Context. 

Ages of different Planets like Mars are described there.
