> The dalton or unified atomic mass unit (symbols: Da or u, respectively) 
> is a unit of mass defined as ⁠1/12⁠ of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 
> in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest. 
> 
> It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI. 
> 
> The word "unified" emphasizes that the definition was accepted by both IUPAP and IUPAC. 
> The atomic mass constant, denoted mu, is defined identically. 
> 
> Expressed in terms of ma(12C), the atomic mass of carbon-12: mu = ma(12C)/12 = 1 Da. 
> The dalton's numerical value in terms of the fixed-h kilogram 
> is an experimentally determined quantity 
> that, along with its inherent uncertainty, is updated periodically. 
> 
> The 2022 CODATA recommended value of the atomic mass constant 
> expressed in the SI base unit kilogram is:mu = 1.66053906892(52)×10−27 kg. 
> As of June 2025, the value given for the dalton (1 Da = 1 u = mu) in the SI Brochure 
> is still listed as the 2018 CODATA recommended value:1 Da = mu = 1.66053906660(50)×10−27 kg. 
>
> This was the value used in the calculation of g/Da, the traditional definition of the Avogadro number,
> g/Da = 6.022140762081123e23, 
> which was then rounded to 9 significant figures 
> and fixed at exactly that value for the 2019 redefinition of the mole.
>
> The value serves as a conversion factor of mass from daltons to kilograms, 
> which can easily be converted to grams and other metric units of mass. 
> 
> The 2019 revision of the SI redefined the kilogram by fixing the value of the Planck constant (h), 
> improving the precision of the atomic mass constant expressed in SI units 
> by anchoring it to fixed physical constants. 
> Although the dalton remains defined via carbon-12, 
> the revision enhances traceability and accuracy in atomic mass measurements.
>
> The mole is a unit of amount of substance used in chemistry and physics, 
> such that the mass of one mole of a substance expressed in grams 
> (i.e., the molar mass in g/mol or kg/kmol) 
> is numerically equal to the average mass of an elementary entity of the substance 
> (atom, molecule, or formula unit) expressed in daltons. 
> 
> For example, the average mass of one molecule of water is about 18.0153 Da, 
> and the mass of one mole of water is about 18.0153 g. 
> 
> A protein whose molecule has an average mass of 64 kDa would have a molar mass of 64 kg/mol. 
> However, while this equality can be assumed for practical purposes, 
> it is only approximate, because of the 2019 redefinition of the mole.
