# [[Mass]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[Moment_of_Inertia]] 

This measures the Inertia of a Body 
when exposed to a Force. 
This is equivalent to the [[Angular_Dimension/Moment_of_Inertia|Moment_of_Inertia]] for Rotation. 

Due to the equivalence of Gravitation 
and Curvature of Space, 
the same Value operates as Weight, 
so inert Mass and heavy Mass are always proportional to each other. 

There are many Units for Mass, but the SI-Unit is the [[../Unit/SI-Unit/Unit~Gram|Unit~Gram]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Mass** is an intrinsic property of a body. 
> It was traditionally believed to be related to the quantity of matter in a body, 
> until the discovery of the atom and particle physics. 
> 
> It was found that different atoms and different elementary particles, 
> theoretically with the same amount of matter, have nonetheless different masses. 
> 
> Mass in modern physics has multiple definitions which are conceptually distinct, but physically equivalent. 
> Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body's inertia, 
> meaning the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied. 
> The object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
>
> The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). 
> In physics, mass is not the same as weight, 
> even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, 
> rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. 
> 
> An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, 
> but it would still have the same mass. 
> This is because weight is a force, 
> while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.
>
> In the Standard Model of physics, 
> the mass of elementary particles is believed to be a result of their coupling with the Higgs boson 
> in what is known as the Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism.
