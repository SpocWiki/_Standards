## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Decibel** (symbol: dB) is a relative unit of measurement equal to one tenth of a bel (B). 
> It expresses the ratio of two values of a power or root-power quantity on a logarithmic scale. 
> Two signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10 (approximately 1.26) 
> or root-power ratio of 101/20 (approximately 1.12). 
>
> The strict original usage above only expresses a relative change. 
> However, the word decibel has since also been used for expressing an absolute value 
> that is relative to some fixed reference value, 
> in which case the dB symbol is often suffixed with letter codes that indicate the reference value. 
> For example, for the reference value of 1 volt, a common suffix is "V" (e.g., "20 dBV").
>
> As it originated from a need to express power ratios, 
> two principal types of scaling of the decibel are used to provide consistency 
> depending on whether the scaling refers to ratios of power quantities or root-power quantities. 
> 
> When expressing a power ratio, it is defined as ten times the logarithm with base 10. 
> That is, a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level. 
> When expressing root-power ratios, 
> a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level. 
> The decibel scales differ by a factor of two, 
> so that the related power and root-power levels change by the same value in linear systems, 
> where power is proportional to the square of amplitude.
>
> The definition of the decibel originated in the measurement of transmission loss and power 
> in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. 
> 
> The bel was named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, but the bel is seldom used. 
> Instead, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, 
> most prominently for sound power in acoustics, in electronics and control theory. 
> In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, 
> and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.
