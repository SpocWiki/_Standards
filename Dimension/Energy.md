> **Energy** (from Ancient Greek  ἐνέργεια (enérgeia) 'activity') 
> is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, 
> recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. 
> 
> Energy is a conserved quantity—
> the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, 
> but not created or destroyed. 
> The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J).
>
> Forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system, and rest energy associated with an object's rest mass. These are not mutually exclusive.
>
> All living organisms constantly take in and release energy. The Earth's climate and ecosystems processes are driven primarily by radiant energy from the sun.
