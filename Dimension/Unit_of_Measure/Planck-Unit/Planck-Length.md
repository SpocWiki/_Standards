## lₚ = √(ℏ G/c³) 

This is about 1e−20 times the diameter of a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton"). 
This would be the Size a particle whose [reduced Compton wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_Compton_wavelength "Reduced Compton wavelength") 
is comparable to its [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius), 
so that it would immediately decay via [[Hawking-Radiation]].

Any attempt to investigate at these distances, 
by performing higher-energy collisions, 
would result in black hole production.
