# [[Dim~Mass]] 

This measures the Inertia of a Body 
when exposed to a Force. 

Due to the equivalence of Gravitation 
and Curvature of Space, 
the same Value operates as Weight, 
so inert Mass and heavy Mass are always proportional to each other. 

There are many Units for Mass, but the SI-Unit is the [[../Unit/SI-Unit/Unit~Gram|Unit~Gram]]
