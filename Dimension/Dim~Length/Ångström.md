> The angstrom (; ANG-strəm) is a unit of length equal to 
> - 10−10 m; that is, 
> - one ten-billionth of a metre, 
> - a hundred-millionth of a centimetre, 
> - 0.1 nanometre, or 
> - 100 picometres. 
> 
> The unit is named after the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas **Ångström** (1814–1874).  
> It was originally spelled with Swedish letters, as Ångström and later as ångström.  
> The latter spelling is still listed in some dictionaries, but is now rare in English texts. 
> Some popular US dictionaries list only the spelling angstrom.
>
> The unit's symbol is Å, which is a letter of the Swedish alphabet, 
> regardless of how the unit is spelled. 
> However, "A" or "A.U." may be used in less formal contexts or typographically limited media.
>
> The angstrom is often used in the natural sciences and technology 
> to express sizes of atoms, molecules, microscopic biological structures, 
> and lengths of chemical bonds, arrangement of atoms in crystals, 
> wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, and dimensions of integrated circuit parts. 
> 
> The atomic (covalent) radii of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine are about 1 angstrom, 
> while that of hydrogen is about 0.5 angstroms. 
> Visible light has wavelengths in the range of 4000–7000 Å.

> In the late 19th century, spectroscopists adopted 10−10 of a metre as a convenient unit to express the wavelengths of characteristic spectral lines (monochromatic components of the emission spectrum) of chemical elements. However, they soon realized that the definition of the metre at the time, based on a material artifact, was not accurate enough for their work.  So, around 1907 they defined their own unit of length, which they called "Ångström", based on the wavelength of a specific spectral line. It was only in 1960, when the metre was redefined in the same way, that the angstrom became again equal to 10−10 metre.  Yet the angstrom was never part of the SI system of units, and has been increasingly replaced by the nanometre (10−9 m) or picometre (10−12 m).
