> The calorie is a unit of energy that originated from the caloric theory of heat. 
> The large calorie, food calorie, dietary calorie,  or kilocalorie 
> is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one liter of water 
> by one degree Celsius (or one kelvin). 
> 
> The small calorie or gram calorie is defined as the amount of heat needed 
> to cause the same 1°K increase in one milliliter of water. 
> Thus, 1 large calorie is equal to 1,000 small calories.
>
> In nutrition and food science, the term calorie and the symbol cal 
> may refer to the large unit or to the small unit in different regions of the world. 
> 
> It is generally used in publications and package labels 
> to express the energy value of foods in per serving or per weight, 
> recommended dietary caloric intake, metabolic rates, etc. 
> 
> Some authors recommend the spelling Calorie and the symbol Cal (both with a capital C) 
> if the large calorie is meant, to avoid confusion; however, this convention is often ignored.
>
> In physics and chemistry, the word calorie and its symbol usually refer to the small unit, the large one being called kilocalorie (kcal). However, the kcal is not officially part of the International System of Units (SI), and is regarded as obsolete, having been replaced in many uses by the SI derived unit of energy, the joule (J), or the kilojoule (kJ) for 1000 joules.
>
> The precise equivalence between calories and joules has varied over the years, but in thermochemistry and nutrition it is now generally assumed that one (small) calorie (thermochemical calorie) is equal to exactly 4.184 J, and therefore one kilocalorie (one large calorie) is 4184 J or 4.184 kJ.
