> The internal energy of a thermodynamic system 
> is the energy of the system as a state function, 
> measured as the quantity of energy necessary 
> to bring the system from its standard internal state to its present internal state of interest, 
> accounting for the gains and losses of energy due to changes in its internal state, 
> including such quantities as magnetization. 
> 
> It excludes the kinetic energy of motion of the system as a whole 
> and the potential energy of position of the system as a whole, 
> with respect to its surroundings and external force fields. 
> 
> It includes the thermal energy, i.e., the constituent particles' kinetic energies of motion relative to the motion of the system as a whole. 
> 
> Without a thermodynamic process, the internal energy of an isolated system cannot change, 
> as expressed in the law of conservation of energy, 
> a foundation of the first law of thermodynamics.

> The notion has been introduced to describe the systems characterized by temperature variations, temperature being added to the set of state parameters, the position variables known in mechanics (and their conjugated generalized force parameters), in a similar way to potential energy of the conservative fields of force, gravitational and electrostatic.

> of substance, or of energy, as heat, or by thermodynamic work.  
> These processes are measured by changes in the system's properties,

> The internal energy depends only on the internal state of the system

> Thermodynamics defines internal energy macroscopically, for the body as a whole. In statistical mechanics, the internal energy of a body can be analyzed microscopically in terms of the kinetic energies of microscopic motion of the system's particles from translations, rotations, and vibrations, and of the potential energies associated with microscopic forces, including chemical bonds.

> The unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). The internal energy relative to the mass with unit J/kg is the specific internal energy. The corresponding quantity relative to the amount of substance with unit J/mol is the molar internal energy.
