# [[Dim~Energy]] 

Energy and [[../Mass]] are convertible, 
but at low-energy, the Change in Mass is negligible. 

It's SI Unit is the [[../Unit_of_Measure/SI-Unit/derived_Unit/Unit~Joule]].  

Due to the [[Isotropy]] of Time, it is a conserved Unit. 

In[[../../../Knowledge/Physics.internal/Quantum-Physics|Quantum-Physics]]] the [[Dim~Frequency]] of a Particle is 
given by its [[Dim~Energy]]:  ___E = h * f_ __
