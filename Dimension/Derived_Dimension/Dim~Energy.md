# [[Dim~Energy]] 

Energy and [[../Dim~Mass]] are convertible, 
but at low-energy, the Change in Mass is negligible. 

It's SI Unit is the [[../../Unit/SI-Unit/derived_Unit/Unit~Joule]].  

Due to the [[Isotropy]] of Time, it is a conserved Unit. 

In [[../../../Knowledge/Physics/Quantum-Physics|Quantum-Physics]] the [[Dim~Frequency]] of a Particle is 
given by its [[Dim~Energy]]:  ___E = h * f_ __
