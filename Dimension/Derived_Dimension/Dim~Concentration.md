> In chemistry, **Concentration** is the amount of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. 
> 
> Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: 
> mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration. 
> 
> The concentration can refer to any kind of chemical mixture, 
> but most frequently refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. 
> 
> The molar (amount) concentration has variants, 
> such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration. 
> 
> Dilution is reduction of concentration, e.g., by adding solvent to a solution. 
> The verb to concentrate means to increase concentration, the opposite of dilute.
