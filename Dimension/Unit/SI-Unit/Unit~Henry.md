> The henry (symbol: H) is the unit of electrical inductance in the International System of Units 
> (SI), defined as 1 kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅A−2. 
> If a current of 1 ampere flowing through a coil produces flux linkage of 1 weber turn, 
> that coil has a self-inductance of 1 henry.‌ 
> 
> The unit is named after Joseph Henry (1797–1878), 
> the American scientist who discovered electromagnetic induction independently of 
> and at about the same time as Michael Faraday (1791–1867) in England.
