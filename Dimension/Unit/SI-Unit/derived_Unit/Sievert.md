> The **Sievert** (symbol: Sv) is a derived unit in the International System of Units (SI) 
> intended to represent the stochastic health risk of ionizing radiation, 
> which is defined as the probability of causing radiation-induced cancer and genetic damage. 
> 
> The sievert is important in dosimetry and radiation protection. 
> It is named after Rolf Maximilian Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist 
> renowned for work on radiation dose measurement 
> and research into the biological effects of radiation.
>
> The sievert unit is used for radiation dose quantities such as equivalent dose and effective dose, 
> which represent the risk of external radiation from sources outside the body, 
> and committed dose, which represents the risk of internal irradiation 
> due to inhaled or ingested radioactive substances. 
> 
> According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), 
> one sievert results in a 5.5% probability of eventually developing fatal cancer 
> based on the disputed linear no-threshold model of ionizing radiation exposure.
>
> To calculate the value of stochastic health risk in sieverts, 
> the physical quantity absorbed dose is converted into equivalent dose and effective dose 
> by applying factors for radiation type and biological context, published by the ICRP 
> and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU).  
> One sievert equals 100 rem, which is an older, CGS radiation unit. 
>
> Conventionally, deterministic health effects due to acute tissue damage 
> that is certain to happen, produced by high dose rates of radiation, 
> are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the unit gray (Gy).
