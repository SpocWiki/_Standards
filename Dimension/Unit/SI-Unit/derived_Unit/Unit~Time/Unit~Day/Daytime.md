> **Daytime** or day as observed on Earth is the period of the day 
> during which a given location experiences natural illumination from direct sunlight. 
> 
> Daytime occurs when the Sun appears above the local horizon, 
> that is, anywhere on the globe's hemisphere facing the Sun. 
> 
> In direct sunlight the movement of the sun can be recorded and observed 
> using a sundial that casts a shadow that slowly moves during the day. 
> 
> Other planets and natural satellites that rotate relative to a luminous primary body, 
> such as a local star, also experience daytime, 
> but this article primarily discusses daytime on Earth.
>
> Very broadly, most humans tend to be awake during some of the daytime period 
> at their location, and asleep during some of the night period.
