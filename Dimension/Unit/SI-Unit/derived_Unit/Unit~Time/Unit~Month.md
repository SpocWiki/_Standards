## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Month** is an irregular unit of time, used with calendars, 
> that is approximately as long as a natural phase cycle of the Moon; 
> the words month and Moon are cognates. 
> 
> The traditional concept of months arose with the cycle of Moon phases; 
> such lunar months ("lunations") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days, 
> making for roughly  12.37 such months in one Earth year. 
> 
> From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced 
> that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. 
> Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, 
> are still the basis of many calendars today and are used to divide the year.
>
> Calendars that developed from the Roman calendar system, 
> such as the internationally used Gregorian calendar, divide the year into 12 months, 
> each of which lasts between 28 and 31 days. 
> 
> The names of the months were Anglicized 
> from various Latin names and events important to Rome, except for the months 9–12, 
> which are named after the Latin numerals 7–10 (septem, octo, novem, and decem) 
> because they were originally the seventh through tenth months in the Roman calendar. 
> 
> In the modern Gregorian calendar, the only month with a variable number of days 
> is the second month, February, which has 29 days during a leap year and 28 days otherwise.
