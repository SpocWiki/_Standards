> The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one 
> proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). 
> 
> It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit. 
> Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, 
> but the original paper suggests the lower defining point, 0 °F, 
> was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine 
> made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt). 
> The other limit established was his best estimate of the average human body temperature, originally set at 90 °F, 
> then 96 °F (about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale).
>
> For much of the 20th century, the Fahrenheit scale was defined by two fixed points with a 180 °F separation: 
> the temperature at which pure water freezes was defined as 32 °F 
> and the boiling point of water was defined to be 212 °F, both at sea level and under standard atmospheric pressure. 
> It is now formally defined using the Kelvin scale.
>
> It continues to be used in the United States (including its unincorporated territories), 
> its freely associated states in the Western Pacific 
> (Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands), the Cayman Islands, and Liberia.
>
> Fahrenheit is commonly still used alongside the Celsius scale in other countries that use the U.S. metrological service, 
> such as Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas, and Belize. 
> 
> A handful of British Overseas Territories, including the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Anguilla, and Bermuda, 
> also still use both scales. 
> All other countries now use Celsius ("centigrade" until 1948), which was invented 18 years after the Fahrenheit scale.
