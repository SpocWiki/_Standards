> The imperial system of units, imperial system or imperial units 
> (also known as British Imperial or Exchequer Standards of 1826) 
> is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act 1824 
> and continued to be developed through a series of Weights and Measures Acts and amendments.
>
> The imperial system developed from earlier English units 
> as did the related but differing system of customary units of the United States. 
> The imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards, 
> which were in effect from 1588 to 1825. 
> The system came into official use across the British Empire in 1826.
>
> By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire 
> had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement, 
> but imperial units are still used alongside metric units in the United Kingdom 
> and in some other parts of the former empire, notably Canada.
>
> The modern UK legislation defining the imperial system of units 
> is given in the Weights and Measures Act 1985 (as amended).
