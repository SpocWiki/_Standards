> The **Newton-metre** (also non-hyphenated, newton metre; symbol N⋅m or N m) 
> is the unit of torque (also called moment) in the International System of Units (SI). 
> 
> One newton-metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton 
> **applied perpendicularly** to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long.
>
> The unit is also used less commonly as a unit of work, or energy, 
> in which case it is equivalent to the more common and standard SI unit of energy, the joule. 
> 
> In this usage the metre term represents the distance travelled or displacement 
> in the direction of the force, and not the perpendicular distance from a fulcrum 
> (i.e. the lever arm length) as it does when used to express torque. 
> 
> This usage is generally discouraged, since it can lead to confusion as to whether a 
> given quantity expressed in newton-metres is a torque or a quantity of energy. 
> 
> "Even though torque has the same dimension as energy (SI unit joule), 
> the joule is never used for expressing torque".
>
> Newton-metres and joules are dimensionally equivalent in the sense that 
> they have the same expression in SI base units,
> but are distinguished in terms of applicable kind of quantity, 
> to avoid misunderstandings when a torque is mistaken for an energy or vice versa. 
> 
> Similar examples of dimensionally equivalent units include 
> Pa versus J/m3, Bq versus Hz, and ohm versus ohm per square.
