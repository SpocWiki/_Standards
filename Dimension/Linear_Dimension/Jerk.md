# [[Jerk]] 

#is_/similar_to :: [[Angular_Jerk]] 

In physics, jerk (also known as jolt) is the 
rate of change of an object's acceleration over time, or 
the 3rd Derivative of the [[../../Mathematics/Geometry/Position-Vector|Position-Vector]] by [[../Dim~Time]]. 

It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction). 
Jerk is most commonly denoted by the symbol j 
and expressed in m/sÂ³ (SI units) or 
standard gravities per second (g0/s).

The corresponding [[../Angular_Dimension|Angular_Dimension]] is 

Engineers expend considerable design effort 
minimizing "jerky motion" on [elevators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator "Elevator"), [trams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram "Tram"), and other conveyances.

To minimize the jerk, curves along roads are designed to be [clothoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral "Euler spiral") 
as are railroad curves and [roller coaster loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_loop "Vertical loop").

Jump-discontinuity in acceleration can be modeled 
using a [Dirac delta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta "Dirac delta") in jerk, scaled to the height of the jump.
