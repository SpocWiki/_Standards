> In classical mechanics, **Impulse** (symbolized by J or Imp) 
> is the **change in [[../Momentum|Momentum]]** of an object. 
> 
> If the initial momentum of an object is p1, and a subsequent momentum is p2, the object has received an impulse J = p_2 - p_1
>
> Momentum is a vector quantity, so impulse is also a vector quantity:
>         ∑ F × Δt = Δp
>
> Newton's second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object 
> is equal to the resultant force F acting on the object:
>           F = (p_2 - p_1) / Δt
> so the impulse J delivered by a steady force F acting for time Δt is:
>           J = F Δt
>
> The impulse delivered by a varying force acting from time a to b is the integral of the force F with respect to time: 
> J = ∫ F dt
>   
> The SI unit of impulse is the newton-second (N⋅s), 
> and the unit of momentum is the kilogram-metre per second (kg⋅m/s). 
> 
> The corresponding English engineering unit is the pound-second (lbf⋅s), 
> and in the British Gravitational System, the unit is the slug-foot per second (slug⋅ft/s).
