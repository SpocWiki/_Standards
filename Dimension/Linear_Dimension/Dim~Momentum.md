# [[Dim~Momentum]] 

[[Dim~Momentum]] is the Product of [[../Dim~Mass|Dim~Mass]] and [[../Linear_Dimension/Dim~Speed]]. 

Due to the [[Isotropy]] of Space, it is a conserved Unit. 

In [[../../../Knowledge/Physics/Quantum-Physics|Quantum-Physics]] the [[Wavelength]] of a Particle is 
given by its inverse [[Dim~Momentum]]:  ___Î» = h / p___ 

A change in Momentum is also called Impulse, 
a Distinction similar to that between [[../../Mathematics/Geometry/Position-Vector|Position-Vector]] and [[../../Mathematics/Geometry/Vector|Vector]]
