> In physics, a **Force** is an influence that can cause an object to change its velocity, 
> unless counterbalanced by other forces, or its shape. 
> 
> In mechanics, force makes ideas like 'pushing' or 'pulling' mathematically precise. 
> Because the magnitude and direction of a force are both important, force is a vector quantity (force vector). 
> The SI unit of force is the newton (N), and force is often represented by the symbol F.
>
> Force plays an important role in classical mechanics. The concept of force is central to all three of Newton's laws of motion. Types of forces often encountered in classical mechanics include elastic, frictional, contact or "normal" forces, and gravitational. The rotational version of force is torque, which produces changes in the rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. In the case of multiple forces, if the net force on an extended body is zero the body is in equilibrium.

> In modern physics, which includes relativity and quantum mechanics, the laws governing motion are revised to rely on fundamental interactions as the ultimate origin of force. However, the understanding of force provided by classical mechanics is useful for practical purposes.
