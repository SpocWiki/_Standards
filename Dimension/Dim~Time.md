# [[Dim~Time]]   

There are many Units for Time-Duration, 
but the SI-Unit is the [[Unit_of_Measurement/SI-Unit/Unit~Second|Unit~Second]].

> **Time** is the continuous progression of existence 
> that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession 
> from the past, through the present, and into the future. 
> 
> Time dictates all forms of action, age, and causality, 
> being a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, 
> to compare the duration of events (or the intervals between them), 
> and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. 
> Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.
>
> Time is primarily measured in linear spans or periods, ordered from shortest to longest. 
> Practical, human-scale measurements of time are performed using clocks and calendars, 
> reflecting a 24-hour day collected into a 365-day year linked to the astronomical motion of the Earth. 
> 
> Scientific measurements of time instead vary from Planck time at the shortest 
> to billions of years at the longest. 
> 
> Measurable time is believed to have effectively begun with the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, 
> encompassed by the chronology of the universe. 
> 
> Modern physics understands time to be inextricable from space 
> within the concept of spacetime described by general relativity. 
> Time can therefore be dilated by velocity and matter to pass faster or slower for an external observer, 
> though this is considered negligible outside of extreme conditions, 
> namely relativistic speeds or the gravitational pulls of black holes.
>
> Throughout history, time has been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science. 
> 
> Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, 
> and has been a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. 
> 
> Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value ("time is money") 
> as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day ("carpe diem") 
> and in human life spans.
