# [[Dim~Angular_Momentum]] 

[[Dim~Angular_Momentum]] is the Product of [[../Dim~Mass|Dim~Mass]] and [[../Linear_Dimension/Dim~Speed]]. 

Due to the [[Isotropy]] of Space, it is a conserved Unit. 

In [[../../../Knowledge/Physics/Quantum-Physics|Quantum-Physics]] the [[Wavelength]] of a Particle is 
given by its inverse [[Dim~Angular_Momentum]]:  ___Î» = h / p___
