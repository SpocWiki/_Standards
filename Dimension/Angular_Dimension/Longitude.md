> **Longitude** is a geographic coordinate that 
> specifies the east-west position of a point on the surface of a celestial body. 
> 
> It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees 
> and denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ). 
> 
> Meridians are imaginary semicircular lines running from pole to pole 
> that connect points with the same longitude. 
> The prime meridian defines 0° longitude; 
> by convention the International Reference Meridian for the Earth 
> passes near the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, south-east London, Great Britain. 
> Positive longitudes are east of the prime meridian, and negative ones are west.
>
> Because of the Earth's rotation, 
> there is a close connection between longitude and time measurement. 
> Scientifically precise local time varies with longitude: 
> a difference of 15° longitude corresponds to a one-hour difference in local time, 
> due to the differing position in relation to the Sun. 
> Comparing local time to an absolute measure of time 
> allows longitude to be determined. 
> 
> Depending on the era, the absolute time might be obtained from a celestial event 
> visible from both locations, such as a lunar eclipse, 
> or from a time signal transmitted by telegraph or radio. 
> 
> The principle is straightforward, but in practice 
> finding a reliable method of determining longitude took centuries 
> and required the effort of some of the greatest scientific minds.
>
> A location's north-south position along a meridian is given by its latitude, 
> which is approximately the angle between the equatorial plane 
> and the normal from the ground at that location.
>
> Longitude is generally given using the geodetic normal or the gravity direction. 
> The astronomical longitude can differ slightly from the ordinary longitude 
> because of vertical deflection, small variations in Earth's gravitational field (see astronomical latitude).
