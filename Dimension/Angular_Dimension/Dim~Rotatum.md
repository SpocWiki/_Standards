# [[Dim~Rotatum]] 

[[Dim~Rotatum]] is the Change in [[Dim~Torque]] over Time, 
i.e. the Derivative of [[Dim~Torque]] by [[../Dim~Time]], 
or equivalently the 2nd Derivative of [[../Angular_Dimension/Dim~Angular_Momentum|Dim~Angular_Momentum]] by [[../Dim~Time]]. 

The corresponding [[../Linear_Dimension]] is [[Dim~Yank]].
