> In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux through a surface 
> is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B over that surface.  
> 
> It is usually denoted Φ or ΦB. 
> 
> The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb; in derived units, volt–seconds or V⋅s), 
> and the CGS unit is the maxwell. 
> 
> Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils, and it calculates the magnetic flux from the change of voltage on the coils.
