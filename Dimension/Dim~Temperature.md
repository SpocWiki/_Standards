# [[Dim~Temperature]]  

There are many Units for Temperature, but the SI-Unit is the [[../Unit/SI-Unit/Unit~Kelvin|Unit~Kelvin]].   

Temperature is a macroscopic, statistical Unit that measures the average undirected kinetic Energy of a Body in any [[Aggregate_State]].  

This Energy is not evenly distributed among the Body Elements. 
The Distribution depends on the Elements' Character: 

## Classic Maxwell Distribution 


## Fermionic Distribution 


## Bosonic Distribution
