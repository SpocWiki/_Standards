> In physics, the Stoney units form a system of units 
> named after the Irish physicist [[Stoney~George_Johnstone]], 
> who first proposed them in 1881. 
> 
> They are the earliest example of natural units, 
> i.e., a coherent set of units of measurement designed 
> so that chosen physical constants fully define and are included in the set.
