## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Month** is a unit of time, used with calendars, that 
> is approximately as long as a natural phase cycle of the Moon; 
> the words month and Moon are cognates. 
> 
> The traditional concept of months arose with the cycle of Moon phases; 
> such lunar months ("lunations") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days, 
> making for roughly  12.37 such months in one Earth year. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today and are used to divide the year.
>
> Calendars that developed from the Roman calendar system, such as the internationally used Gregorian calendar, divide the year into 12 months, each of which lasts between 28 and 31 days. The names of the months were Anglicized from various Latin names and events important to Rome, except for the months 9–12, which are named after the Latin numerals 7–10 (septem, octo, novem, and decem) because they were originally the seventh through tenth months in the Roman calendar. In the modern Gregorian calendar, the only month with a variable number of days is the second month, February, which has 29 days during a leap year and 28 days otherwise.
