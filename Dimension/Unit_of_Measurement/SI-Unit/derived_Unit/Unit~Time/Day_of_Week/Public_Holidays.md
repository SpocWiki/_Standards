#is_a_/public_holidays

This stands for any day that is a public holiday; it is a placeholder for all official public holidays in some particular location. While not technically a "day of the week", it can be used with [[OpeningHoursSpecification]]. In the context of an opening hours specification it can be used to indicate opening hours on public holidays, overriding general opening hours for the day of the week on which a public holiday occurs.
