> Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, a state at which a system's internal energy, 
> and in ideal cases entropy, reach their minimum values. 
> 
> The Kelvin scale is defined so that absolute zero is 0 K, 
> equivalent to −273.15 °C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale. 
> 
> The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by design. 
> This limit can be estimated by extrapolating the ideal gas law 
> to the temperature at which the volume and pressure of a classical gas becomes zero.
>
> At absolute zero, there is no thermal motion. 
> However, due to quantum effects, the particles still exhibit minimal motion 
> mandated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
> and additionally, for a system of fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle. 
> Even if absolute zero could be achieved, this residual quantum motion would persist. 
>
> Although absolute zero can be approached, it cannot be reached. 
> Some isentropic processes, such as adiabatic expansion, 
> can lower the system's temperature without relying on a colder medium. 
> 
> Nevertheless, the third law of thermodynamics implies that 
> no physical process can reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps. 
> 
> As a system nears this limit, further reductions in temperature become increasingly difficult, 
> regardless of the cooling method used. 
> 
> In the 21st century, scientists have achieved temperatures below 100 picokelvin (pK). 
> At low temperatures, matter displays exotic quantum phenomena such as 
> - superconductivity, 
> - superfluidity, and 
> - Bose–Einstein condensation.
