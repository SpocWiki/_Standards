> In materials science, **Hardness** (antonym: softness) 
> is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation, 
> such as an indentation (over an area) or a scratch (linear), 
> induced mechanically either by pressing or abrasion. 
> 
> In general, different materials differ in their hardness; for example 
> - hard metals such as titanium and beryllium are harder than 
> - soft metals such as sodium and metallic tin, or wood and common plastics. 
> 
> Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, 
> but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; 
> therefore, hardness can be measured in different ways, such as 
> - scratch hardness, 
> - indentation hardness, and 
> - rebound hardness. 
> 
> Hardness is dependent on ductility, elastic stiffness, plasticity, strain, strength, toughness, viscoelasticity, and viscosity. 
> 
> Common examples of hard matter are ceramics, concrete, certain metals, 
> and superhard materials, which can be contrasted with soft matter.
