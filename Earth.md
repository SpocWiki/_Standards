> **Earth** is the third planet from the Sun 
> and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
> This is enabled by Earth being a water world, 
> the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. 
> 
> Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. 
> The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located 
> in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. 
> 
> Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, 
> while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water 
> than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. 
> 
> Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, 
> which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. 
> 
> Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere 
> capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation. 
>
> Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions 
> and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. 
> It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. 
> Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, 
> forming clouds that cover most of the planet. 
> The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, 
> together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), 
> creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist 
> via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. 
> 
> This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), 
> at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. 
> Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions 
> (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) 
> drive atmospheric and ocean currents, 
> producing a global climate system with different climate regions, 
> and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, 
> allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.
>
> Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. 
> It is the densest planet in the Solar System. 
> Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. 
> Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, 
> taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. 
> 
> Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day 
> (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). 
> Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane around the Sun, 
> producing seasons. 
> 
> Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, 
> which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) 
> and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. 
> 
> The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, 
> causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation. 
> Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.
>
> Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, 
> formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust in the early Solar System. 
> 
> During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed 
> and then life developed within it. 
> Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, 
> leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. 
> Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa 
> and have spread across every continent on Earth. 
> 
> Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, 
> but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. 
> Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, 
> threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, 
> and causing widespread extinctions.
