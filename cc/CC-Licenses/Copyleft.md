Copyleft is a Reaction to the [[US_Copyright_Act,1976]] on Software, 
which was followed up by the [[DMCA(Digital Millennium Copyright Act)]] of 1998. 

> **Copyleft** is the legal technique of granting certain freedoms 
> over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement 
> that the same rights be preserved in derivative works. 
> 
> In this sense, freedoms refers to the use of the work for any purpose, 
> and the ability to modify, copy, share, and redistribute the work, with or without a fee. 
> 
> Licenses which implement copyleft can be used 
> to maintain copyright conditions for works ranging from computer software, 
> to documents, art, scientific discoveries and even certain patents.
>
> Copyleft software licenses are considered protective or reciprocal 
> in contrast with permissive free software licenses, 
> and require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work 
> must be made available to recipients of the software program, 
> which are often distributed as executables. 
> 
> This information is most commonly in the form of source code files, 
> which usually contain a copy of the license terms 
> and acknowledge the authors of the code. 
> 
> Copyleft help ensuring everyone's rights to freely use the product 
> but is prohibited from owning, registering copyright and earning royalties from copyright.
>
> Notable copyleft licenses include the GNU General Public License (GPL), 
> originally written by Richard Stallman, 
> which was the first software copyleft license to see extensive use; 
> the Mozilla Public License; the Free Art License; 
> and the Creative Commons share-alike license conditionâ€”
> with the last two being intended for non-software works, 
> such as documents and pictures, both academic or artistic in nature.
