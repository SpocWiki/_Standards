## Properties:

### EndTime
The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g. FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g. John wrote a book from January to \*December\*. For media, including audio and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.

Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future revisions.

EndTime:: {"type":"Date","options":{"dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD","defaultInsertAsLink":"false"}}

### PartySize
Number of people the reservation should accommodate.

PartySize:: {"type":"Number","options":{}}

### StartTime
