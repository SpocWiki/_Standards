# ComputerLanguage
This is a kind of [[FileClass~Intangible]]

This type covers computer programming languages such as Scheme and Lisp, as well as other language-like computer representations. Natural languages are best represented with the [[Language]] type.

Computer Languages are used both for instructing Computers 
and for programming them (by creating Blocks and adding Flow-Statements), 
therefore this is not named [[../../../schema-org/Relation/has/has_programming_language|has_programming_language]]  , 
which is a relation between [[../../../schema-org/Class/is_a_/creative_work/software_source_code|SoftwareSourceCode]] and a [[../../../schema-org/Class/is_a_/Intangible/computer_language|ComputerLanguage]].
