# Play
This is a kind of [[FileClass~CreativeWork]]

A play is a form of literature, usually consisting of dialogue between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading. Note: A performance of a Play would be a [[TheaterEvent]] or [[BroadcastEvent]] - the \*Play\* being the [[workPerformed]].
