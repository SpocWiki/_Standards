# SatiricalArticle
This is a kind of [[FileClass~Article]]

An [[Article]] whose content is primarily [satirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) in nature, i.e. unlikely to be literally true. A satirical article is sometimes but not necessarily also a [[NewsArticle]]. [[ScholarlyArticle]]s are also sometimes satirized.
