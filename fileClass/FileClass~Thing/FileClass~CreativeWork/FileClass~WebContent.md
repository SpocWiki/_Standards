# WebContent
This is a kind of [[FileClass~CreativeWork]]

WebContent is a type representing all [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] content. It is sometimes the case that detailed distinctions between Web pages, sites and their parts are not always important or obvious. The  [[WebContent]] type makes it easier to describe Web-addressable content without requiring such distinctions to always be stated. (The intent is that the existing types [[WebPage]], [[WebSite]] and [[WebPageElement]] will eventually be declared as subtypes of [[WebContent]].)
