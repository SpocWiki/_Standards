# CovidTestingFacility
This is a kind of [[FileClass~MedicalClinic]]

A CovidTestingFacility is a [[MedicalClinic]] where testing for the COVID-19 Coronavirus  
 disease is available. If the facility is being made available from an established [[Pharmacy]], [[Hotel]], or other  
 non-medical organization, multiple types can be listed. This makes it easier to re-use existing schema.org information  
 about that place, e.g. contact info, address, opening hours. Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.
