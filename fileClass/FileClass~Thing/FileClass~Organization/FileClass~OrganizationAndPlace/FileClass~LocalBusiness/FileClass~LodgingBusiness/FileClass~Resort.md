A resort is a place used for relaxation or recreation, attracting visitors for holidays or vacations. Resorts are places, towns or sometimes commercial establishments operated by a single company (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort&lt;/a&gt;).  
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  
 See also the &lt;a href="/docs/hotels.html"&gt;dedicated document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations&lt;/a&gt;.
