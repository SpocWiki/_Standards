A hotel is an establishment that provides lodging paid on a short-term basis (source: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel).  
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  
 See also the &lt;a href="/docs/hotels.html"&gt;dedicated document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations&lt;/a&gt;.
