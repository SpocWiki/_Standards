# CheckInAction
This is a kind of [[FileClass~CommunicateAction]]

The act of an agent communicating (service provider, social media, etc) their arrival by registering/confirming for a previously reserved service (e.g. flight check-in) or at a place (e.g. hotel), possibly resulting in a result (boarding pass, etc).

Related actions:

\* [[CheckOutAction]]: The antonym of CheckInAction.
\* [[ArriveAction]]: Unlike ArriveAction, CheckInAction implies that the agent is informing/confirming the start of a previously reserved service.
\* [[ConfirmAction]]: Unlike ConfirmAction, CheckInAction implies that the agent is informing/confirming the \*start\* of a previously reserved service rather than its validity/existence.
