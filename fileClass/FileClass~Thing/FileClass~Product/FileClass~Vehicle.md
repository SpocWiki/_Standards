# Vehicle
This is a kind of [[FileClass~Product]]

A vehicle is a device that is designed or used to transport people or cargo over land, water, air, or through space.


## Use one of these Tags for Objects of this Type:

#is_a_/Vehicle
#class/Vehicle
#class/Thing/Product/Vehicle

## Properties:

### AccelerationTime
The time needed to accelerate the vehicle from a given start velocity to a given target velocity.

Typical unit code(s): SEC for seconds

\* Note: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for seconds/0..100 km/h or seconds/0..60 mph. Simply use "SEC" for seconds and indicate the velocities in the [[name]] of the [[QuantitativeValue]], or use [[valueReference]] with a [[QuantitativeValue]] of 0..60 mph or 0..100 km/h to specify the reference speeds.
