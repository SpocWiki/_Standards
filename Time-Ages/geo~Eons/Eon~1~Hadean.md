# [[Eon~1~Hadean]] 

#is_a_/time_/Eon

A time period from 4567 to 4031 million years ago.

> The **Hadean** (IPA:  hay-DEE-ən, HAY-dee-ən) is the first and oldest of the four known  geologic eons of Earth's history, starting with the planet's formation about 4.54 Bya, now defined as (4567.30 ± 0.16) Mya set by the age of the oldest solid material in the Solar System found in some meteorites about 4.567 billion years old. 
> 
> The supposed interplanetary collision that created the Moon occurred early in this eon. 
> 
> The Hadean ended 4.031 billion years ago and was succeeded by the Archean eon, with the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesized to have occurred at the Hadean-Archean boundary.
>
> Hadean rocks are very rare, largely consisting of granular zircons from one locality (Jack Hills) in Western Australia. Hadean geophysical models remain controversial among geologists: it appears that plate tectonics and the growth of continents may have started in the Hadean. 
> 
> Earth in the early Hadean had a very thick carbon dioxide- and methane-rich prebiotic atmosphere, but eventually oceans made of liquid water were formed.
