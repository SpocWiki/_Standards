> **Milankovitch cycle**s describe the collective effects of changes in the Earth's movements 
> on its climate over thousands of years. 
> 
> The phenomenon 
> is named after the Serbian geophysicist and astronomer Milutin Milanković. 
> In the 1920s, he provided a more definitive and quantitative analysis 
> than James Croll's earlier hypothesis that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, 
> and precession combined to result in cyclical variations 
> in the intra-annual and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation at the Earth's surface, 
> and that this orbital forcing strongly influenced the Earth's climatic patterns.
