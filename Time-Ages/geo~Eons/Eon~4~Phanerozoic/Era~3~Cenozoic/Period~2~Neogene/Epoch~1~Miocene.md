> The **Miocene** ( MY-ə-seen, -⁠oh-) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period 
> and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago (Ma). 
> 
> The Miocene was named by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell; 
> the name comes from the Greek words μείων (meíōn, "less") and καινός (kainós, "new") 
> and means "less recent" 
> because it has 18% fewer modern marine invertebrates than the Pliocene has. 
> The Miocene is preceded by the [[../Period~1~Paleogene/Epoch~3~Oligocene|Epoch~3~Oligocene]] and is followed by the [[Epoch~2~Pliocene]].
>
> As Earth went from the Oligocene through the Miocene and into the Pliocene, 
> the __climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages__. 
> The Miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event 
> but consist rather of regionally defined boundaries 
> between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene Epoch.
>
> During the Early Miocene, Afro-Arabia collided with Eurasia, 
> severing the connection between the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans, 
> and allowing a faunal interchange to occur between Eurasia and Africa, 
> including the dispersal of proboscideans into Eurasia. 
> 
> During the late Miocene, the connections between the Atlantic and Mediterranean closed, 
> causing the Mediterranean Sea to nearly completely evaporate, 
> in an event called the [[Messinian_salinity_crisis]]. 
> The Strait of Gibraltar opened and the Mediterranean refilled 
> at the Miocene–Pliocene boundary, in an event called the [[Zanclean_flood]].
>
> The apes first evolved, arose, and diversified during the early Miocene 
> (Aquitanian and Burdigalian Stages), becoming widespread in the Old World. 
> By the end of this epoch and the start of the following one, 
> the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chimpanzees 
> to follow their own evolutionary path 
> during the final Messinian Stage (7.5–5.3 Ma) of the Miocene. 
> 
> As in the Oligocene before it, grasslands continued to expand and forests to dwindle in extent. 
> In the seas of the Miocene, kelp forests made their first appearance 
> and soon became one of Earth's most productive ecosystems.
> The plants and animals of the Miocene were recognizably modern. 
> Mammals and birds were well-established. Whales, pinnipeds, and kelp spread.
>
> The Miocene is of particular interest to geologists and palaeoclimatologists 
> as major phases of the geology of the Himalaya occurred during the Miocene, 
> affecting monsoonal patterns in Asia, 
> which were interlinked with glacial periods in the northern hemisphere.
