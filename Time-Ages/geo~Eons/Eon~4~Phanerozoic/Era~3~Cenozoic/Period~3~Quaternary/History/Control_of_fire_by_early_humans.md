## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The control of fire by early humans was a critical technology enabling the evolution of humans. 
> Fire provided a source of warmth and lighting, protection from predators (especially at night), 
> a way to create more advanced hunting tools, and a method for cooking food. 
> 
> These cultural advances allowed human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, 
> and changes to diet and behavior. 
> Additionally, creating fire allowed human activity 
> to continue into the darker and colder hours of the evening.
>
> Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire 
> by a member of Homo range from 1.7 to 2.0 million years ago (Mya). 
> 
> Evidence for the "microscopic traces of wood ash" as controlled use of fire by Homo erectus, 
> beginning roughly 1 million years ago, has wide scholarly support. 
> Some of the earliest known traces of controlled fire were found 
> at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge, Israel, and dated to ~790,000 years ago. 
> 
> At the site, archaeologists also found the oldest likely evidence 
> (mainly, fish teeth that had been heated deep in a cave) 
> for the controlled use of fire to cook food ~780,000 years ago. 
> However, some studies suggest cooking started ~1.8 million years ago.
>
> Flint blades burned in fires roughly 300,000 years ago 
> were found near fossils of early but not entirely modern Homo sapiens in Morocco. 
> Fire was used regularly and systematically by early modern humans 
> to heat treat silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking 
> approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point. 
> 
> Evidence of widespread control of fire by anatomically modern humans 
> dates to approximately 125,000 years ago.
