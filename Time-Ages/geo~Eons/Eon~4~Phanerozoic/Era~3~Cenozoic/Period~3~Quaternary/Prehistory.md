> **Prehistory**, also called pre-literary history, is the period of human history 
> between the first known use of stone tools by hominins c. 3.3 million years ago 
> and the beginning of recorded history with the invention of writing systems. 
> 
> The use of symbols, marks, and images appears very early among humans, 
> but the earliest known writing systems appeared c. 5,200 years ago. 
> It took thousands of years for writing systems to be widely adopted, 
> with writing having spread to almost all cultures by the 19th century. 
> The end of prehistory therefore came at different times in different places, 
> and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.
>
> In the early Bronze Age, Sumer in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley Civilisation, and ancient Egypt 
> were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts and keep historical records, 
> with their neighbours following. 
> 
> Most other civilizations reached their end of prehistory during the following Iron Age. 
> The three-age division of prehistory into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age 
> remains in use for much of Eurasia and North Africa, 
> but is not generally used in those parts of the world 
> where the working of hard metals arrived abruptly from contact with Eurasian cultures, 
> such as Oceania, Australasia, much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Americas. 
> With some exceptions in pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, 
> these areas did not develop writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, 
> so their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; 
> for example, 1788 is usually taken as the end of the prehistory of Australia.
>
> The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed its own writing system, 
> is often known as the protohistory of the culture. 
> By definition, there are no written records from human prehistory, 
> which can only be known from material archaeological and anthropological evidence: 
> prehistoric materials and human remains. 
> 
> These were at first understood by the collection of folklore 
> and by analogy with pre-literate societies observed in modern times. 
> The key step to understanding prehistoric evidence is dating, 
> and reliable dating techniques have developed steadily since the nineteenth century. 
> 
> The most common of these dating techniques is radiocarbon dating. 
> Further evidence has come from the reconstruction of ancient spoken languages. 
> More recent techniques include forensic chemical analysis to reveal the use and provenance of materials, 
> and genetic analysis of bones to determine kinship and physical characteristics of prehistoric peoples.
