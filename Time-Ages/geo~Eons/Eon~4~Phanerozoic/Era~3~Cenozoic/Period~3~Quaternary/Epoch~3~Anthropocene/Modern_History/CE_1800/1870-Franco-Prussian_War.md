> The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War, often referred to in France as the War of 1870, 
> was a conflict between the Second French Empire 
> and the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. 
> 
> Lasting from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871, the conflict was caused primarily 
> by France's determination to reassert its dominant position in continental Europe, 
> which appeared in question following the decisive Prussian victory over Austria in 1866. 
>
> After in 1870 a prince of the Roman Catholic branch Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen 
> had been offered the vacant Spanish throne, and had withdrawn his acceptance, 
> the French ambassador once more approached Prussian King Wilhelm I at his vacationing site in Ems 
> to demand Wilhelm renounce any future claims. 
> 
> The internal Ems dispatch reported this to Berlin on July 13, 
> Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck quickly made it public with altered wording. 
> Thus the French newspapers for July 14, the French national holiday 
> contained translations of Bismarck's press release, but not a report from their own ambassador. 
> A crowd in the streets of Paris demanded war, and soon French mobilization was ordered. 
>
> According to some historians, 
> Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked the French into declaring war on Prussia 
> in order to induce four independent southern German states—
> Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—to join the North German Confederation. 
> Other historians contend that Bismarck exploited the circumstances as they unfolded. 
> All agree that Bismarck recognized the potential for new German alliances, given the situation as a whole.
>
> France mobilised its army on 15 July 1870, 
> leading the North German Confederation to respond with its own mobilisation later that day. 
> On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on Prussia; 
> France invaded German territory on 2 August. 
> The German coalition mobilised its troops much more effectively than the French 
> and invaded northeastern France on 4 August. 
> German forces were superior in numbers, training, and leadership 
> and made more effective use of modern technology, particularly railways and artillery.
>
> A series of hard-fought Prussian and German victories in eastern France, 
> culminating in the Siege of Metz and the Battle of Sedan, 
> resulted in the capture of the French Emperor Napoleon III 
> and the decisive defeat of the army of the Second Empire; 
> a Government of National Defense was formed in Paris on 4 September 
> and continued the war for another five months. 
> 
> German forces fought and defeated new French armies in northern France, 
> then besieged Paris for over four months before it fell on 28 January 1871, effectively ending the war.
>
> In the final days of the war, with German victory all but assured, 
> the German states proclaimed their union as the German Empire 
> under the Prussian king Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck. 
> 
> With the notable exceptions of Austria and German Switzerland, 
> the vast majority of German-speakers were united under a nation-state for the first time. 
> Following an armistice with France, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed on 10 May 1871, 
> giving Germany billions of francs in war indemnity, as well as most of Alsace and parts of Lorraine, 
> which became the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen).
>
> The war had a lasting impact on Europe. 
> By hastening German unification, the war significantly altered the balance of power on the continent, 
> with the new German state supplanting France as the dominant European land power. 
> Bismarck maintained great authority in international affairs for two decades, 
> developing a reputation for Realpolitik that raised Germany's global stature and influence. 
> In France, it brought a final end to imperial rule and began the first lasting republican government. 
> 
> Resentment over the French government's handling of the war and its aftermath 
> triggered the Paris Commune, 
> a revolutionary uprising which seized and held power for two months before its suppression; 
> the event would influence the politics and policies of the Third Republic.
