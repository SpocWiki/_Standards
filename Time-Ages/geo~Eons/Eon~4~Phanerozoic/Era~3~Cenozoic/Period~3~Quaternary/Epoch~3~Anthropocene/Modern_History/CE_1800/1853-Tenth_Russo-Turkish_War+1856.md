> The Crimean War was fought between the Russian Empire 
> and an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, the Second French Empire, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont from October 1853 to February 1856. 
> 
> Geopolitical causes of the war included 
> - the "Eastern question" (the decline of the Ottoman Empire), 
> - expansion of Imperial Russia in the preceding Russo-Turkish wars, and 
> - the British and French preference to preserve the Ottoman Empire 
>   to maintain the balance of power in the Concert of Europe.
>
> The war's proximate cause was a dispute between France and Russia 
> over the rights of Catholic and Orthodox minorities in Palestine. 
> 
> After the Sublime Porte refused Tsar Nicholas I's demand 
> that the Empire's Orthodox subjects be placed under his protection, 
> Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities in July 1853. 
> 
> The Ottomans declared war on Russia in October. Fearing the growth of Russian influence 
> and compelled by public outrage over the annihilation of the Ottoman squadron at Sinop, 
> Britain and France joined the war on the Ottoman side in March 1854. 
> The Russian advance was halted at Silistria in June.
>
> In September 1854, after extended preparations, allied forces landed in Crimea 
> in an attempt to capture Russia's main naval base in the Black Sea, Sevastopol. 
> 
> They scored an early victory at the Battle of the Alma. 
> The Russians counterattacked in late October in what became the Battle of Balaclava 
> and were repulsed, and a second counterattack at Inkerman ended in a stalemate. 
> The front settled into the 11-month Siege of Sevastopol, 
> involving brutal conditions for troops on both sides. 
> 
> Smaller military actions took place in the Caucasus (1853–1855), 
> the White Sea (July–August 1854) and the North Pacific (1854–1855). 
> The Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont entered on the allies' side in 1855.
>
> Sevastopol ultimately fell after a renewed French assault on the Malakoff redoubt 
> in September 1855. 
> Diplomatically isolated and facing the prospect of invasion from the west if the war continued, 
> Russia sued for peace in March 1856. 
> 
> France and Britain welcomed the development due to the conflict's domestic unpopularity. 
> The Treaty of Paris, signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war. 
> 
> It forbade Russia to base warships in the Black Sea. 
> The Ottoman vassal states of Wallachia and Moldavia became largely independent. 
> Christians in the Ottoman Empire gained a degree of official equality, 
> and the Orthodox Church regained control of the Christian churches in dispute.
>
> The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts 
> in which military forces used modern technologies such as 
> explosive naval shells, railways, and telegraphs. 
> 
> It was also one of the first to be documented extensively 
> in written reports and in photographs. 
> 
> The war quickly symbolized logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement. 
> The reaction in Britain led to a demand for the professionalization of medicine, 
> most famously achieved by Florence Nightingale, who gained worldwide attention for pioneering modern nursing while she treated the wounded.
>
> The Crimean War also marked a turning point for the Russian Empire. 
> It weakened the Imperial Russian Army, drained the treasury, 
> and undermined its influence in Europe. 
> 
> The defeat forced Russia's educated elites to identify the country's fundamental problems. 
> It became a catalyst for reforms of Russia's social institutions, 
> including the emancipation reform of 1861, which abolished serfdom in Russia, 
> and overhauls in the justice system, local self-government, education, and military service.
