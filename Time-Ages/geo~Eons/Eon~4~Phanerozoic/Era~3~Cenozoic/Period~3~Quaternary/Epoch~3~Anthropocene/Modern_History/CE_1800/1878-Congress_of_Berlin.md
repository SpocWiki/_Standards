## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> At the Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878), the major European powers 
> revised the territorial and political terms imposed by the Russian Empire 
> on the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of San Stefano (March 1878), 
> which had ended the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. 
> 
> The Congress was the result of escalating tensions; 
> particularly British opposition to Russian hegemony over the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, 
> through the creation of a Russian-aligned 'Greater Bulgaria'. 
> To secure the European balance of power in favour of its splendid isolation 
> achieved after the Crimean War, Britain stationed the Mediterranean Fleet near Constantinople 
> to enforce British demands. 
> 
> To avoid war, Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of the newly formed German Empire, 
> was asked to mediate a solution that would restore the Ottoman Empire's position 
> as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, 
> in line with the principles of the 1856 Treaty of Paris.
>
> Attended by delegates from Europe's then six great powers: 
> Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany; the Ottomans 
> as well as representatives of four Balkan states (Greece, Serbia, Romania and Montenegro), 
> the Congress culminated in the Treaty of Berlin (13 July 1878). 
> 
> This agreement essentially dismantled the autonomous Greater Bulgarian State of San Stefano, 
> and reorganised the borders of south-eastern Europe. 
> 
> The main results were the Austro-Hungarian forcible occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
> the British de facto annexation of Cyprus under false pretenses, 
> and the formal recognition of the self-declared independence of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro; 
> allies of Russia in the previous war. 
> 
> While the settlement averted war, it exacerbated nationalist grievances in the Balkans 
> and deepened the rivalry between Britain and Russia (The Great Game), 
> contributing to long-term regional instability that foreshadowed the Balkan Wars and World War I. 
>
> As mediator of the Congress, Otto von Bismarck negotiated along the lines 
> laid down by Britain in its secret negotiations before the Congress. 
> 
> He also wanted to avoid Russian domination of the Balkans, or the formation of a Greater Bulgaria, 
> and to keep Constantinople in Ottoman hands. 
> Finally, Bismarck helped to secure civil rights for Jews in the region, 
> as a precondition for international recognition of the newly formed states.
>
> The affected territories were instead granted varying degrees of independence. Romania became fully independent, though was forced to give part of Bessarabia to Russia, and gained Northern Dobruja. Serbia and Montenegro were also granted full independence but lost territory, with Austria-Hungary occupying the Sanjak of Novi Pazar along with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Britain took possession of Cyprus. Of the territory that remained within the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria was made a semi-independent principality, Eastern Rumelia became a special administration, and the region of Macedonia was returned to the Ottomans on condition of reforms to its governance.
>
> The results were initially hailed as a success for peace in the region, but most of the participants were not satisfied with the outcome. The Ottomans were humiliated and had their weakness confirmed as the "sick man of Europe". Russia resented the lack of rewards, despite having won the war that the conference was supposed to resolve, and felt humiliated by the other great powers in their rejection of the San Stefano settlement. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece all received far less than they thought they deserved, especially Bulgaria which was left with less than half of the territory envisioned by the Treaty of San Stefano. Bismarck became hated by Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and later found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria-Hungary in the Balkans. Although Austria-Hungary gained substantial territory, this angered the South Slavs and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, culminating in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
>
> In the long term, the settlement led to rising tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, and disputes over nationalism in the Balkans. Grievances with the results of the congress festered until they exploded in the First and Second Balkan Wars (1912 and 1913 respectively). Continuing nationalism in the Balkans was was a major factor for the First World War in 1914.
