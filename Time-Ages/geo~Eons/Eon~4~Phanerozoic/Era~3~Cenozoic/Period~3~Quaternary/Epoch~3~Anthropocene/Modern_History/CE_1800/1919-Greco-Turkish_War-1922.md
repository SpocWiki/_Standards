> The Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 was fought between Greece 
> and the Turkish National Movement during the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire 
> in the aftermath of World War I, between 15 May 1919 and 14 October 1922. 
> This conflict was a part of the Turkish War of Independence.
>
> The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies, 
> particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, 
> had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, 
> recently defeated in World War I. 
> 
> Greek claims stemmed from the fact that Western Anatolia had been part of Ancient Greece 
> and the Byzantine Empire before the Turks conquered the area in the 12th–15th centuries. 
> The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna (now İzmir), on 15 May 1919. 
> 
> They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, 
> including the cities of Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, Kütahya, Bursa, and Eskişehir. 
> Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the Battle of the Sakarya in 1921. 
> The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922, 
> and the war effectively ended with the recapture of Smyrna by Turkish forces 
> and the great fire of Smyrna.
>
> As a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement 
> and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving Eastern Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. 
> 
> The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres 
> to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. 
> The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey 
> and its sovereignty over Anatolia, Istanbul, and Eastern Thrace. 
> The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in a [[../../../../../../../../Society/Military/Population_Exchange|Population_Exchange]].
