## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The **Holocaust** was the genocide of European Jews during World War II. 
> Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators 
> systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe, 
> around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population. 
> The murders were carried out primarily through mass shootings 
> and poison gas in extermination camps, chiefly [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Treblinka]], [[Belzec]], 
> [[Sobibor]], and [[Chełmno]] in occupied Poland.
>
> The Nazis developed their ideology based on racism and pursuit of "living space", 
> and seized power in early 1933. 
> Meant to force all German Jews regardless of means to attempt to emigrate, 
> the regime passed anti-Jewish laws, encouraged harassment, 
> and orchestrated a nationwide pogrom in November 1938. 
> After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, 
> occupation authorities began to establish ghettos to segregate Jews. 
> Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, 
> 1.5 to 2 million Jews were shot by German forces and local collaborators.
>
> Later in 1941 or early 1942, 
> the highest levels of the German government decided to murder all Jews in Europe. 
> 
> Victims were deported by rail to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, 
> most were killed with poison gas. 
> Other Jews continued to be employed in forced labor camps 
> where many died from starvation, abuse, exhaustion, 
> or being used as test subjects in deadly medical experiments. 
> 
> Although many Jews tried to escape, surviving in hiding was difficult 
> due to factors such as the lack of money to pay helpers and the risk of denunciation. 
> The property, homes, and jobs belonging to murdered Jews 
> were redistributed to the German occupiers and other non-Jews. 
> Although the majority of Holocaust victims died in 1942, 
> the killing continued at a lower rate until the end of the war in May 1945. 
> Separate Nazi persecutions killed a similar number of non-Jewish civilians and [[POW(prisoner_of_war)|POW]]s; 
> the term Holocaust is sometimes used 
> to also refer to the persecution of these other groups.
>
> Many Jewish survivors emigrated outside of Europe after the war. 
> A few Holocaust perpetrators faced criminal trials. 
> Billions of dollars in reparations have been paid, although falling short of the Jews' losses. 
> The Holocaust has also been commemorated in museums, memorials, and culture. 
> It has become central to Western historical consciousness 
> as a symbol of the ultimate human evil.
