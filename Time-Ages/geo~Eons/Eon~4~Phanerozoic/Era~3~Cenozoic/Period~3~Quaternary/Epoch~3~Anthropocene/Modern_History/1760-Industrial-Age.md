> The **Industrial age** is a period of history that encompasses the 
> changes in economic and social organization that began around 1760 in Great Britain 
> and later in other countries, characterized chiefly by the replacement of hand tools 
> with power-driven machines such as the power loom and the steam engine, 
> and by the concentration of industry in large establishments.
>
> While it is commonly believed that the Industrial Age 
> was supplanted by the Information Age in the late 20th century, 
> a view that has become common since the Revolutions of 1989, 
> much of the Third World economy is still based on manufacturing, 
> although mobile phones are now commonplace even in the poorest of countries, 
> enabling access to global information networks. 
> 
> Even though many developing countries remain largely industrial, 
> the Information Age is increasingly on the ground.
