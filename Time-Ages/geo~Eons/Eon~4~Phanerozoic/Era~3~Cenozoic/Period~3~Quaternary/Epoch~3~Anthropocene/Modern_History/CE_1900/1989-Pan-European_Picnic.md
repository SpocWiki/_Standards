> The Pan-European Picnic (German: Paneuropäisches Picknick; Hungarian: Páneurópai piknik; Slovak: Paneurópsky piknik; Czech: Panevropský piknik) was a peace demonstration 
> held on the Austro-Hungarian border near Sopron, Hungary on 19 August 1989. 
> 
> The **opening of the border gate between Austria and Hungary** at the Pan-European Picnic 
> was one event in the chain reaction, at the end of which Germany reunified, 
> the Iron Curtain fell apart, and the Eastern Bloc disintegrated. 
> The communist governments and the Warsaw Pact subsequently dissolved, 
> ending the Cold War.
>
> The idea of opening the border at a ceremony and testing the Soviet Union's response 
> came from Ferenc Mészáros of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) 
> and Otto von Habsburg, then the President of the Paneuropean Union 
> and the former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. 
> 
> The idea was brought up by them to Miklós Németh, 
> then the Hungarian Prime Minister, who also promoted the idea.
>
> The Pan-European Picnic itself developed further from 
> a meeting between Otto von Habsburg and Ferenc Mészáros in June 1989. 
> The local organisation in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, 
> and the other contacts were made via Habsburg 
> and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay. 
> 
> The Austrian Paneuropean Union and the MDF took care of 
> advertising the event with leaflets that were distributed in Hungary. 
> 
> The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and Pozsgay, who were not present at the event, 
> saw the planned event as an opportunity to **test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction** 
> to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain.
>
> The official emblem of the picnic was a dove breaking through the barbed wire. 
> At the picnic several hundred East German citizens overran the old wooden gate, 
> reaching Austria unhindered by the border guards around Árpád Bella. 
> 
> It was the largest mass exodus since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. 
> The Hungarian borders were opened on 11 September, 
> and the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November. 
> 
> The Warsaw Pact disintegrated in 1991.
