## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Yalta Conference (Russian: Ялтинская конференция, 
> romanized: Yaltinskaya konferentsiya), held 4–11 February 1945, 
> was the World War II meeting of the heads of government of the 
> United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union 
> to discuss the postwar reorganization of Germany and Europe. 
> 
> The three states were represented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
> Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and General Secretary Joseph Stalin. 
> The conference was held near Yalta in Crimea, Soviet Union, 
> within the Livadia, Yusupov, and Vorontsov palaces.
>
> The aim of the conference was to shape a postwar peace 
> that represented not only a collective security order, 
> but also a plan to give self-determination to the liberated peoples of Europe. 
> Intended mainly to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe, 
> within a few years, with the Cold War dividing the continent, 
> the conference became a subject of intense controversy.
>
> Yalta was the second of three major wartime conferences among the Big Three. 
> It was preceded by the Tehran Conference in November 1943 
> and was followed by the Potsdam Conference in July 1945. 
> 
> It was also preceded by a conference in Moscow in October 1944, 
> not attended by Roosevelt, in which Churchill and Stalin had reached 
> an informal agreement on Western and Soviet spheres of influence in Europe.
