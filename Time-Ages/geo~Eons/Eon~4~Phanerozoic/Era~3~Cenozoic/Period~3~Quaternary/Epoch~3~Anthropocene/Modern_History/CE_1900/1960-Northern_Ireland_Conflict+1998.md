## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Troubles (Irish: Na Trioblóidí) were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland 
> that lasted for about 30 years from the late 1960s to 1998. 
> 
> Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it began in the late 1960s 
> and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. 
> Although the Troubles mostly took place in Northern Ireland, 
> at times violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe.
>
> Sometimes described as an asymmetric or irregular war or a low-intensity conflict, 
> the Troubles were a political and nationalistic struggle fueled by historical events, 
> with a strong ethnic and sectarian dimension, fought over the status of Northern Ireland. 
> 
> Unionists and loyalists, who for historical reasons were mostly Ulster Protestants, 
> wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. 
> 
> Irish nationalists and republicans, who were mostly Irish Catholics, 
> wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland. 
> Despite the division between Protestants and Catholics, it was not primarily a religious war.
>
> The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association
>  to end discrimination against the Catholic-nationalist minority 
>  by the Protestant-unionist government and local authorities. 
>  
>  The government attempted to suppress the protests. 
>  The police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), were overwhelmingly Protestant 
>  and known for sectarianism and police brutality. 
>  
>  The campaign was also violently opposed by Ulster loyalists, 
>  who believed it was a front for republican political activity. 
>  Increasing tensions led to the August 1969 riots and the deployment of British troops, 
>  in what became the British Army's longest operation. 
>  
>  "Peace walls" were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. 
>  Some Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a more neutral force than the RUC, 
>  but soon came to see it as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody Sunday in 1972.
>
> The main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries 
> such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); 
> loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); 
> British state security forces such as the British Army and RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary); 
> and political activists. 
> 
> The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. 
> Republicans carried out a guerrilla campaign against British forces 
> as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructural, commercial, and political targets. 
> 
> Loyalists attacked republicans/nationalists and the wider Catholic community 
> in what they described as retaliation. 
> 
> At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence, 
> as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups. 
> The British security forces undertook policing and counterinsurgency campaigns, 
> primarily against republicans. 
> 
> There were incidents of collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries 
> (see Stevens Inquiries). 
> 
> The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests, and acts of civil disobedience, 
> and led to increased segregation and the creation of temporary no-go areas.
>
> More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 
> 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were members of paramilitary groups. 
> 
> Republican paramilitaries were responsible for 60% of total deaths, 
> followed by loyalist paramilitaries at 30% and security forces at 10%. 
> Loyalists were responsible for 48% of all civilian deaths, however, 
> followed by republicans at 39% and security forces at 10%.
>
> The Northern Ireland peace process led to paramilitary ceasefires 
> and talks between the main political parties, 
> which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. 
> 
> This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of "power-sharing" 
> and it included acceptance of the principle of consent, commitment to civil and political rights, 
> parity of esteem between the two communities, police reform, paramilitary disarmament, 
> and early release of paramilitary prisoners.
>
> There has been sporadic violence since the Agreement, including punishment attacks, 
> loyalist gangs' control of major organised crime rackets 
> (e.g., drugs supply, community coercion and violence, intimidation), 
> and violent crime linked to dissident republican groups.
