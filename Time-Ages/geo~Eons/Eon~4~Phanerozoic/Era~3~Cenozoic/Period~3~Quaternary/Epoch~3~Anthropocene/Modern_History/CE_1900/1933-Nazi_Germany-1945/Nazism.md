> **Nazism**  ( NA(H)T-see-iz-əm), formally named National Socialism 
> (NS; German: Nationalsozialismus, German: [natsi̯oˈnaːlzotsi̯aˌlɪsmʊs] ), 
> is the far-right totalitarian ideology and practices 
> associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in Germany. 
> 
> During Hitler's rise to power, it was frequently called Hitler Fascism and Hitlerism. 
> The term "neo-Nazism" is applied to far-right groups formed after World War II with similar ideology.
>
> Nazism is a form of fascism, with disdain for liberal democracy and the parliamentary system. 
> Its beliefs include support for dictatorships, fervent antisemitism, anti-communism, anti-Slavism, anti-Romani sentiment, scientific racism, anti-Chinese sentiment, white supremacy, Nordicism, social Darwinism, homophobia, ableism, and eugenics. 
> 
> The Nazis' ultranationalism originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist Völkisch movement, 
> which had been prominent within German ultranationalism since the late 19th century. 
> 
> Nazism was influenced by the Freikorps paramilitary groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in World War I, 
> from which the party's "cult of violence" came. 
> 
> It subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of a racial hierarchy, 
> identifying ethnic Germans as part of what the Nazis regarded as a Nordic Aryan master race. 
> Nazism sought to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous German society based on racial purity. 
> The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, 
> gain lands for expansion under the doctrine of Lebensraum, 
> and exclude those deemed either Community Aliens or "inferior" races (Untermenschen).
>
> The term "National Socialism" arose from attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of socialism, 
> as an alternative to Marxist international socialism and free-market capitalism. 
> 
> Nazism rejected Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, 
> opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince the social classes in German society 
> to subordinate their interests to the "common good". 
> 
> The Nazi Party's precursor, the pan-German nationalist and antisemitic German Workers' Party, 
> was founded in 1919. 
> 
> In the 1920s, the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party 
> to appeal to left-wing workers, a renaming Hitler initially opposed. 
> 
> The National Socialist Program was adopted in 1920 and called for a united Greater Germany 
> that denied citizenship to Jews and supported land reform and the nationalisation of some industries. 
> 
> In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler outlined the antisemitism and anti-communism 
> at the heart of his philosophy, and his disdain for representative democracy, 
> over which he proposed the Führerprinzip (leader principle). 
> 
> Hitler's objectives involved eastward expansion of German territories, colonization of Eastern Europe, 
> and an alliance with Britain and Italy against the Soviet Union.
>
> The Nazi Party won the greatest share of the vote in both Reichstag elections of 1932, 
> making it the legislature's largest party, albeit short of a majority. 
> 
> Because other parties were unable or unwilling to form a coalition government, 
> Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January 1933 by President Paul von Hindenburg, 
> with the support of conservative nationalists who believed they could control Hitler. 
> 
> With the use of emergency presidential decrees and a change in the Weimar Constitution 
> that allowed the Cabinet to rule by direct decree, the Nazis established a one-party state 
> and began the Gleichschaltung (Nazification). 
> 
> The Sturmabteilung (SA) and the Schutzstaffel (SS) functioned as the party's paramilitary organisations. 
> Hitler purged the party's more radical factions in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives. 
> 
> When Hindenburg died in August 1934, Hitler became head of both state and government, 
> as Führer und Reichskanzler. 
> 
> He was now the dictator of Nazi Germany, under which Jews, political opponents 
> and other "undesirable" elements were marginalised, imprisoned or murdered. 
> 
> During World War II, millions – including two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population – 
> were exterminated in a genocide known as the Holocaust. 
> 
> After Germany's defeat and the discovery of the full extent of the Holocaust, 
> Nazi ideology became universally disgraced. 
> 
> It is widely regarded as evil, with only a few fringe racist groups, usually called neo-Nazis, 
> describing themselves as followers of National Socialism. 
> Use of Nazi symbols is illegal in many European countries, including Germany and Austria.
