> The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States 
> and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, 
> that started in 1947, two years after the end of World War II and lasted to 1991, 
> the fall of the Soviet Union. 
> The signing of the Belavezha Accords on December 8, 1991, 
> which effectively dissolved the [[1922-Soviet_Union]]. 
> This was followed by 
> - the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on December 25, 1991, and 
> - the lowering of the Soviet flag over the Kremlin in Moscow on the same day.
>
> The term cold war is used because 
> there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, 
> but they each supported opposing sides in major regional conflicts known as proxy wars.
>
> The conflict was based on the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence 
> by these two superpowers, following their roles as the Allies of World War II 
> that led to victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945. 
> 
> Aside from the nuclear arms race and conventional military deployment, 
> the struggle for dominance was expressed indirectly, such as psychological warfare, 
> propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, sports diplomacy, 
> and technological competitions like the Space Race. 
> 
> The Cold War began with the announcement of the [[Truman-Doctrine]] in 1947, 
> started a gradual winding down with the [[Sino-Soviet_split]] between the Soviets 
> and the People's Republic of China in 1961, 
> and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
>
> The Western Bloc was led by the United States, as well as a number of First World nations 
> that were generally Capitalist and liberal democratic 
> but __tied to a network of often authoritarian Third World states__, 
> most of which were the European powers' former colonies. 
> 
> The Eastern Bloc was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist party, 
> which had an influence across the Second World 
> and was __also tied to a network of authoritarian states__. 
> The Soviet Union had a command economy 
> and installed similarly Communist regimes in its satellite states. 
> 
> United States involvement in regime change during the Cold War included 
> support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships, governments, 
> and uprisings across the world, 
> while Soviet involvement in regime change included the funding of left-wing parties, 
> wars of independence, revolutions and dictatorships around the world. 
> As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization 
> and achieved independence in the period from 1945 to 1960, 
> many became Third World battlefields in the Cold War.
