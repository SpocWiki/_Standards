> From 1930 to 1952, the government of the Soviet Union, 
> on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin 
> and under the direction of the NKVD official Lavrentiy Beria, 
> forcibly transferred populations of various groups. 
> 
> These actions may be classified into the following broad categories: 
> - deportations of "anti-Soviet" categories of population (often classified as "enemies of the people"), 
> - deportations of entire nationalities, 
> - labor force transfer, and 
> - organized migrations in opposite directions to fill ethnically cleansed territories. 
> 
> Dekulakization marked the first time that an entire class was deported, 
> whereas the deportation of Soviet Koreans in 1937 
> marked the precedent of a specific ethnic deportation of an entire nationality.
>
> In most cases, their destinations were underpopulated 
> remote areas (see Forced settlements in the Soviet Union). 
> 
> This includes deportations to the Soviet Union of non-Soviet citizens 
> from countries outside the USSR. 
> 
> It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations 
> affected at least 6 million people. 
> Of this total, 1.8 million kulaks were deported in 1930–31, 
> 1.0 million peasants and ethnic minorities in 1932–39, whereas about 
> 3.5 million ethnic minorities were further resettled during 1940–52.
>
> Soviet archives documented 390,000 deaths during kulak forced resettlement 
> and up to 400,000 deaths of people deported to forced settlements during the 1940s; however, Nicolas Werth places overall deaths closer to some 1 to 1.5 million perishing as a result of the deportations. 
> 
> Contemporary historians classify these deportations as a crime against humanity 
> and ethnic persecution. 
> 
> Two of these cases with the highest mortality rates 
> have been described as genocides–
> the deportation of the Crimean Tatars was declared as genocide 
> by Ukraine and several other countries, whereas 
> the deportation of the Chechens and Ingush 
> was declared as genocide by the European Parliament, respectively. 
> 
> On 26 April 1991 
> the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, 
> under its chairman Boris Yeltsin, passed the law 
> On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples 
> with Article 2 denouncing all mass deportations as "Stalin's policy of defamation and genocide."
>
> The Soviet Union also practiced deportations in occupied territories, 
> with over 50,000 perishing from the Baltic States 
> and 300,000 to 360,000 perishing during the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe 
> due to Soviet deportation, massacres, and internment and labour camps.
