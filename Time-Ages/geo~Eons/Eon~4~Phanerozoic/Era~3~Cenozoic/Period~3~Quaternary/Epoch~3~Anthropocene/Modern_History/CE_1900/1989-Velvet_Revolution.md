> The Velvet Revolution (Czech: sametová revoluce) 
> or Gentle Revolution (Slovak: nežná revolúcia) 
> was a non-violent transition of power in what was then Czechoslovakia, 
> occurring from 17 November to 28 November 1989. 
> 
> Popular demonstrations against the one-party government 
> of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia included students and older dissidents. 
> The result was the end of 41 years of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, 
> and the subsequent dismantling of the command economy 
> and conversion to a parliamentary republic.
>
> On 17 November 1989 (International Students' Day), 
> riot police suppressed a student demonstration in Prague. 
> 
> The event marked the 50th anniversary of a violently suppressed demonstration 
> against the Nazi storming of Prague University in 1939 
> where 1,200 students were arrested and 9 killed (see International Students' Day). 
> 
> The 1989 event sparked a series of demonstrations from 17 November 
> to late December and turned into an anti-communist demonstration. 
> 
> On 20 November, the number of protesters assembled in Prague 
> grew from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated 500,000. 
> The entire top leadership of the Communist Party, 
> including General Secretary Miloš Jakeš, resigned on 24 November. 
> On 27 November, a two-hour general strike 
> involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia was held.
>
> In response to the collapse of other Warsaw Pact governments 
> and the increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia 
> announced on 28 November that it would relinquish power 
> and end the one-party state. 
> 
> Two days later, the federal parliament formally deleted the sections of the Constitution 
> giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.  
> 
> Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed 
> from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. 
> 
> On 10 December, President Gustáv Husák 
> appointed the first largely non-communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, 
> and resigned. 
> 
> Alexander Dubček, 
> previous Secretary General of Czechoslovakia who sought for reforms 
> and was removed after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, 
> was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December 
> and Václav Havel the president of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989.
>
> In June 1990, Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. 
> On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries, 
> the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. 
> The dissolution of Czechoslovakia occurred mainly 
> due to national governance issues between the Slovaks and Czechs 
> (the two major ethnicities comprising the former Czechoslovakia).
