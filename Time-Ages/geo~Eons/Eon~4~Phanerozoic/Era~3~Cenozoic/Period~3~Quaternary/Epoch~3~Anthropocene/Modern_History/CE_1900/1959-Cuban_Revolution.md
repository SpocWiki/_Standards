> The Cuban Revolution (Spanish: Revolución cubana) was the military and political movement 
> that overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, who had ruled Cuba from 1952 to 1959. 
> 
> The revolution began after the 1952 Cuban coup d'état, 
> in which Batista overthrew the emerging Cuban democracy and consolidated power. 
> Among those who opposed the coup was Fidel Castro, then a young lawyer, 
> who initially tried to challenge the takeover through legal means in the Cuban courts. 
> When these efforts failed, Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl led 
> an armed assault on the Moncada Barracks, a Cuban military post, on 26 July 1953.
>
> Following the attack's failure, Fidel Castro and his co-conspirators were arrested 
> and formed the 26th of July Movement (M-26-7) in detention. 
> 
> At his trial, Fidel Castro launched into a two-hour speech that won him national fame 
> as he laid out his grievances against the Batista dictatorship. 
> 
> In an attempt to win public approval, 
> Batista granted amnesty to the surviving Moncada Barracks attackers 
> and the Castros fled into exile. 
> During their exile, the Castros consolidated their strategy in Mexico 
> and subsequently reentered Cuba in 1956, accompanied by Che Guevara, 
> whom they had encountered during their time in Mexico.
>
> Returning to Cuba aboard the Granma, the Castros, Guevara, and other supporters encountered gunfire from Batista's troops. The rebels fled to the Sierra Maestra where the M-26-7 rebel forces would reorganize, conducting urban sabotage and covert recruitment. Over time the Popular Socialist Party, once the largest and most powerful organizations opposing Batista, would see its influence and power wane in favor of the 26th of July Movement. As the irregular war against Batista escalated, the rebel forces transformed from crude, guerrilla fighters into a cohesive fighting force that could confront Batista's army in military engagements. By the time the rebels were able to oust Batista, the revolution was being driven by a coalition between the Popular Socialist Party, the 26th of July Movement and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March.

> The rebels, led by the 26th of July Movement, finally toppled Batista on 31 December 1958, after which he fled the country. Batista's government was dismantled as Castro became the most prominent leader of the revolutionary forces. Soon thereafter, the 26th of July Movement established itself as the de facto government. Although Castro was immensely popular in the period immediately following Batista's ouster, he quickly consolidated power, leading to domestic and international tensions. 26 July 1953 is celebrated in Cuba as Día de la Revolución (from Spanish: "Day of the Revolution"). The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist–Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.

> The Cuban Revolution had significant domestic and international repercussions, particularly with regard to Cuba–United States relations, which were severely damaged and remain strained despite attempts at reconciliation, such as the Cuban thaw in the 2010s and 2020s. In addition, the Cuban Revolution also had profound ripples effects across many Latin American states as well, serving not only as a symbol of resistance but as a blueprint for what a successful revolution looks like. According to Historian Hal Brands, Cuba became the ideological and strategic heart of what he calls, "Latin America's Cold War." At the same time though, heavy conservative regimes in the Americas began to crack down on this newfound inspiration for dissent, in hopes of preventing, "another Cuba." That being said, Brands notes that Cuba's revolution deepened the region's political divide and added to the overall fuel of Cold War violence. In the revolution's aftermath, Castro's government initiated a program of nationalization, centralized the press, and consolidated political power, which transformed Cuba’s economy and civil society, alienating both segments of the Cuban population and the United States. Castro's authoritarianism, combined with economic challenges, contributed to the Cuban Exodus, with many fleeing to the United States. The revolution also marked the beginning of Cuba's interventions in foreign conflicts, including in Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Middle East. Several rebellions, mainly in the Escambray Mountains, occurred between 1959 and 1965, and were suppressed by the revolutionary government.
