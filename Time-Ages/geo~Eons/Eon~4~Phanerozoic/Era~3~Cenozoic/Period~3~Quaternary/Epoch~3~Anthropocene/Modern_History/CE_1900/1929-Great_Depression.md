> Als **Great Depression**, deutsch Große Depression, bezeichnet man die schwere Wirtschaftskrise in den USA,

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Great Depression** was a severe global economic downturn from 1929 to 1939. 
> The period was characterized by high rates of unemployment and poverty; 
> drastic reductions in liquidity, industrial production, and trade; 
> and widespread bank and business failures around the world. 
> 
> The economic contagion began in 1929 in the United States, the largest economy in the world, 
> with the devastating Wall Street stock market crash of October 1929 
> often considered the beginning of the Depression. 
> Among the countries with the most unemployed were the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Germany.
>
> The Depression was preceded by a period of industrial growth and social development 
> known as the "Roaring Twenties". 
> 
> Much of the profit generated by the boom was invested in speculation, such as on the stock market, 
> which resulted in growing wealth inequality. 
> Banks were subject to minimal regulation under laissez-faire economic policies, 
> resulting in loose lending and widespread debt. 
> 
> By 1929, declining spending had led to reductions in manufacturing output and rising unemployment. 
> Share values continued to rise until the Wall Street crash, after which the slide continued for three years, 
> accompanied by a loss of confidence in the financial system. 
> 
> By 1933, the unemployment rate in the U.S. had risen to 25 percent, 
> about one-third of farmers had lost their land, and about half of its 25,000 banks had gone out of business. 
> The U.S. federal government under President Herbert Hoover 
> was unwilling to intervene heavily in the economy. 
> In the 1932 presidential election, Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
> who from 1933 pursued a set of expansive New Deal programs in order to provide relief and create jobs. 
> 
> In Germany, which depended heavily on U.S. loans, the crisis caused unemployment to rise to nearly 30% 
> and fueled political extremism, paving the way for Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party to rise to power in 1933. 
>
> Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%; 
> in the U.S., the Depression resulted in a 30% contraction in GDP. 
> Recovery varied greatly around the world. 
> Some economies, such as the U.S., Germany and Japan started to recover by the mid-1930s; 
> others, like France, did not return to pre-shock growth rates until later in the decade. 
> 
> The Depression had devastating economic effects on both wealthy and poor countries: 
> all experienced drops in personal income, prices (deflation), tax revenues, and profits. 
> 
> International trade fell by more than 50%, and unemployment in some countries rose as high as 33%. 
> Cities around the world, especially those dependent on heavy industry, were heavily affected. 
> Construction virtually halted in many countries, 
> and farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by up to 60%. 
> 
> Faced with plummeting demand and few job alternatives, 
> areas dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most. 
> The outbreak of World War II in 1939 ended the Depression, as it stimulated factory production, 
> providing jobs for women as militaries absorbed large numbers of young, unemployed men.
>
> The precise causes for the Great Depression are disputed. 
> One set of historians, for example, focuses on non-monetary economic causes. 
> Among these, some regard the Wall Street crash itself as the main cause; 
> others consider that the crash was a mere symptom of more general economic trends of the time, 
> which had already been underway in the late 1920s. 
> 
> A contrasting set of views, which rose to prominence in the later part of the 20th century, 
> ascribes a more prominent role to failures of monetary policy. 
> According to those authors, while general economic trends can explain the emergence of the downturn, 
> they fail to account for its severity and longevity; 
> they argue that these were caused by the lack of an adequate response to the crises of liquidity 
> that followed the initial economic shock of 1929 and the subsequent bank failures 
> accompanied by a general collapse of the financial markets.
