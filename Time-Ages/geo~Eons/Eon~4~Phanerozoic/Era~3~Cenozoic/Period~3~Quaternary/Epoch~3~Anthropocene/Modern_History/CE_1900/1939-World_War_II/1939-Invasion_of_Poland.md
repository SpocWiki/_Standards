> The invasion of Poland, also known as the September Campaign, Polish Campaign, 
> and Polish Defensive War of 1939 (1 September – 6 October 1939), 
> was a joint attack on the Republic of Poland by Nazi Germany, the Slovak Republic, 
> and the Soviet Union, which marked the beginning of World War II. 
> 
> The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, 
> one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact 
> between Germany and the Soviet Union, 
> and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had approved the pact. 
> 
> The Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September. 
> The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing 
> and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. 
>
> The aim of the invasion was to disestablish Poland as a sovereign country, 
> with its citizens destined for extermination. 
> 
> German and Slovak forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west 
> the morning after the Gleiwitz incident. 
> 
> As the Wehrmacht advanced, Polish forces withdrew 
> from their forward bases of operation close to the Germany–Poland border 
> to more established defense lines to the east. 
> 
> After the mid-September Polish defeat in the Battle of the Bzura, 
> the Germans gained an undisputed advantage. Polish forces then withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited expected support and relief from France and the United Kingdom. On 3 September, based on their alliance agreements with Poland, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany; in the end their aid to Poland was very limited. France invaded a small part of Germany in the Saar Offensive, and the Polish army was effectively defeated even before the British Expeditionary Force could be transported to continental Europe.

> On 17 September, the Soviet Red Army invaded Eastern Poland, the territory beyond the Curzon Line that fell into the Soviet "sphere of influence" according to the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact; this rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral Romania. On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the Battle of Kock, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered.
>
> On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration, Germany directly annexed western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory under the administration of the newly established General Government. The Soviet Union incorporated its newly acquired areas into its constituent Byelorussian and Ukrainian republics, and immediately started a campaign of Sovietization. In the aftermath of the invasion, a collective of underground resistance organizations formed the Polish Underground State within the territory of the former Polish state. Many of the military exiles who escaped Poland joined the Polish Armed Forces in the West, an armed force loyal to the Polish government-in-exile.
