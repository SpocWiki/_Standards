## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Iran–Iraq War was an armed conflict between Iran and Iraq 
> that lasted from September 1980 to August 1988. 
> 
> Active hostilities began with the Iraqi invasion of Iran and lasted for nearly eight years, 
> until the acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 by both sides. 
> 
> Iraq's primary rationale for the attack against Iran cited the need 
> to prevent Ruhollah Khomeini—who had spearheaded the Iranian revolution in 1979—
> from exporting the new Iranian ideology to Iraq. 
> 
> There were also fears among the Iraqi leadership of Saddam Hussein 
> that Iran, a theocratic state with a population predominantly composed of Shia Muslims, 
> would exploit sectarian tensions in Iraq by rallying Iraq's Shia majority 
> against the Baʽathist government, which was officially secular 
> but dominated by Sunni Muslims. 
> 
> Iraq also wished to replace Iran as the power player in the Persian Gulf, 
> which was not seen as an achievable objective prior to the Islamic Revolution 
> because of Pahlavi Iran's economic and military superiority 
> as well as its close relationships with the United States and Israel.
>
> The Iran–Iraq War followed a long-running history of 
> territorial border disputes between the two states, 
> as a result of which Iraq planned to retake the eastern bank of the Shatt al-Arab 
> that it had ceded to Iran in the 1975 Algiers Agreement. 
> 
> Iraqi support for Arab separatists in Iran increased following the outbreak of hostilities; 
> Saddam disputedly may have wished to annex Iran's Arab-majority Khuzestan province.
>
> While the Iraqi leadership had hoped to take advantage of Iran's post-revolutionary chaos 
> and expected a decisive victory in the face of a severely weakened Iran, 
> the Iraqi military only made progress for three months, 
> and by December 1980, the Iraqi invasion had stalled. 
> 
> The Iranian military began to gain momentum against the Iraqis 
> and regained all lost territory by June 1982. 
> 
> After pushing Iraqi forces back to the pre-war border lines, 
> Iran rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 514 and launched an invasion of Iraq. 
> The subsequent Iranian offensive within Iraqi territory lasted for five years, 
> with Iraq taking back the initiative in mid-1988 
> and subsequently launching a series of major counter-offensives 
> that ultimately led to the conclusion of the war in a stalemate.
>
> The eight years of war-exhaustion, economic devastation, decreased morale, 
> military stalemate, inaction by the international community towards 
> the use of weapons of mass destruction by Iraqi forces on Iranian soldiers and civilians, 
> as well as increasing Iran–United States military tensions 
> all culminated in Iran's acceptance of a ceasefire 
> brokered by the United Nations Security Council. 
> 
> In total, around 500,000 people were killed during the Iran–Iraq War, 
> with Iran bearing the larger share of the casualties, 
> excluding the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the concurrent Anfal campaign 
> that targeted Iraqi Kurdistan. 
> 
> The end of the conflict resulted in neither reparations nor border changes, 
> and the combined financial losses suffered by both combatants 
> is believed to have exceeded US$1 trillion. 
> 
> There were a number of proxy forces operating for both countries: 
> Iraq and the pro-Iraqi Arab separatist militias in Iran 
> were most notably supported by the National Council of Resistance of Iran; 
> whereas Iran re-established an alliance with the Iraqi Kurds, 
> being primarily supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
> and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. 
> 
> During the conflict, Iraq received an abundance of financial, political, and logistical aid 
> from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, 
> and the overwhelming majority of Arab countries. 
> While Iran was comparatively isolated, it received a significant amount of aid 
> from Syria, Libya, North Korea, China, South Yemen, Cuba, and Israel.
>
> The conflict has been compared to World War I in terms of the tactics used by both sides, 
> including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines, 
> manned machine-gun posts, bayonet charges, Iranian human wave attacks, 
> Iraq's extensive use of chemical weapons, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets. 
> 
> The discourses on martyrdom formulated in the Iranian Shia Islamic context 
> led to the widespread usage of human wave attacks 
> and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the conflict.
