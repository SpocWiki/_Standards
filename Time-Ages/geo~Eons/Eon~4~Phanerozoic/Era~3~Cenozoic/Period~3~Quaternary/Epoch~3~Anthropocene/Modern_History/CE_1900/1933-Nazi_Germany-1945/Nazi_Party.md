> The Nazi Party, officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party 
> (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei  or NSDAP), 
> was a far-right political party in Germany active between 1920 and 1945 
> that created and supported the ideology of Nazism. 
> 
> Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. 
> The Nazi Party emerged from the extremist German nationalist ("Völkisch nationalist"), racist, 
> and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture, 
> which fought against communist uprisings in post–World War I Germany. 
> 
> The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. 
> Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeoisie, and anti-capitalism, 
> disingenuously using socialist rhetoric to gain the support of the lower middle class; 
> that was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders. 
> 
> By the 1930s, the party's main focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes. 
> The party had little popular support until the Great Depression, 
> when worsening living standards and widespread unemployment drove Germans into political extremism.
>
> Central to Nazism were themes of racial segregation expressed in the idea of a "people's community" 
> (Volksgemeinschaft). 
> 
> The party aimed to unite "racially desirable" Germans as national comrades 
> while excluding those deemed to be either political dissidents, physically or intellectually inferior, 
> or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische). 
> 
> The Nazis sought to strengthen the Germanic people, the "Aryan master race", 
> through racial purity and eugenics, broad social welfare programs, 
> and a collective subordination of individual rights, 
> which could be sacrificed for the good of the state on behalf of the people. 
> 
> To protect the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race, 
> the Nazis sought to disenfranchise, segregate, and eventually exterminate Jews, Romani, Slavs, 
> the physically and mentally disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and political opponents. 
> 
> The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state set in motion the Final Solution – 
> an industrial system of genocide that carried out mass murders of around 6 million Jews 
> and millions of other targeted victims  in what has become known as the Holocaust.
>
> Adolf Hitler, the party's leader since 1921, was appointed Chancellor of Germany 
> by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933, and quickly seized power afterwards. 
> Hitler established a totalitarian regime known as the Third Reich and became dictator with absolute power. 
>
> Following the military defeat of Germany in World War II, the party was declared illegal. 
> 
> The Allies attempted to purge German society of Nazi elements in a process known as denazification. 
> Several top leaders were tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trials, 
> and executed. 
> 
> The use of symbols associated with the party is still outlawed in many European countries, 
> including Germany and Austria.
