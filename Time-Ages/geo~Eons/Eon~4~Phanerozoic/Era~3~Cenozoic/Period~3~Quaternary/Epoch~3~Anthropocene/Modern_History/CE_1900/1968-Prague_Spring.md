> The Prague Spring (Czech: Pražské jaro; Slovak: Pražská jar) 
> was a period of political liberalization and mass protest in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. 
> 
> It began on 5 January 1968, when reformist Alexander Dubček 
> was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), 
> and continued until 21 August 1968, when the Soviet Union 
> and three other Warsaw Pact members (Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland) invaded the country  
> to suppress the reforms.
>
> The Prague Spring reforms were an attempt by Dubček 
> to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia 
> in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. 
> 
> The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. 
> After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, 
> Bohemia, Moravia–Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, 
> the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic. 
> This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion.
>
> The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, 
> were not received well by the soviet of USSR, who, after failed negotiations, 
> sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. 
> 
> The New York Times cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with 
> the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. 
> 
> A massive wave of emigration ensued. 
> 
> Resistance  throughout the country included attempted fraternization, sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. 
> 
> While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, 
> the resistance held out for almost eight months 
> until diplomatic maneuvers finally circumvented it. 
> 
> It became a high-profile example of civilian-based defense; 
> there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by self-immolation 
> (the most famous being that of Jan Palach), but no military resistance. 
> Czechoslovakia remained a Soviet satellite state until 1989 
> when the Velvet Revolution peacefully ended the communist regime; 
> the last Soviet troops left the country in 1991.
>
> After the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period known as normalization 
> (Czech: normalizace, Slovak: normalizácia), in which new leaders attempted 
> to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. 
> 
> Gustáv Husák, who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and also became President, 
> reversed almost all of the reforms. 
> 
> The Prague Spring inspired music and literature including the work of 
> Václav Havel, Karel Husa, Karel Kryl and Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being.
