## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Russian Revolution** was a period of political and social change in Russia, starting in 1917. 
> This period saw Russia abolish its monarchy and adopt a socialist form of government 
> following two successive revolutions and a civil war. 
> It can also be seen as the precursor for the other revolutions 
> that occurred in the aftermath of World War I, such as the German Revolution of 1918–1919. 
> The Russian Revolution was one of the key events of the 20th century.
>
> The Russian Revolution was inaugurated with the February Revolution in early 1917, 
> in the midst of World War I. 
> With the German Empire dealing major defeats on the war front, 
> and increasing logistical problems in the rear causing shortages of bread and grain, 
> the Russian Army was steadily losing morale, with large scale mutiny looming. 
> High officials were convinced that if Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, the unrest would subside. 
> 
> Nicholas agreed and stepped down, 
> ushering in a new provisional government led by the Russian Duma (the parliament).
>
> During the civil unrest, soviet councils were formed by the locals in Petrograd 
> that initially did not oppose the new Provisional Government; however, 
> the Soviets did insist on their influence in the government and control over various militias. 
> 
> By March, Russia had two rival governments. 
> The __Provisional Government__ held state power in military and international affairs, 
> whereas the __network of Soviets__ held more power concerning domestic affairs. 
> Critically, the Soviets held the allegiance of the working class, 
> as well as the growing urban middle class. 
> 
> During this chaotic period, there were frequent mutinies, protests and strikes. 
> Many socialist and other leftist political organizations 
> were competing for influence within the Provisional Government and the Soviets. 
> Notable factions included the Mensheviks, Social Revolutionaries, Anarchists, 
> as well as the Bolsheviks, a far-left party led by Vladimir Lenin.
>
> Initially the Bolsheviks were a marginal faction; 
> however, they won popularity with their program promising peace, land, and bread: 
> - cease war with Germany, 
> - give land to the peasantry, and 
> - end the wartime famine. 
> 
> After assuming power, the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting 
> in spite of near-universal public opposition. 
> Taking advantage of the decision to stay in the war, the Bolsheviks 
> and other socialist factions gained popular support to advance the revolution further.
>
> Responding to widespread discontent in Petrograd, 
> the Provisional Government repressed protestors leading to the July Days. 
> Shortly thereafter, the Bolsheviks merged various workers' militias loyal to them 
> into the Red Guards, which would be strong enough to seize power. 
> 
> The volatile situation reached its climax with the October Revolution, 
> a Bolshevik armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd 
> that overthrew the Provisional Government, thereby seizing state power. 
> 
> The Bolsheviks, acting in the framework of the soviet councils, established their own government 
> and later proclaimed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). 
> Under pressure from German military offensives, 
> the Bolsheviks soon relocated the national capital to Moscow.
>
> The RSFSR began the process of reorganizing the former empire 
> into the world's first socialist state, 
> to practice soviet democracy on a national and international scale. 
> 
> Their promise to end Russia's participation in the First World War was fulfilled 
> when the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. 
> 
> To secure the new state, the Bolsheviks established the Cheka, 
> a secret police and revolutionary security service working to uncover, punish, 
> and eliminate those considered to be "enemies of the people" 
> in campaigns called the Red Terror, consciously modeled on those of the French Revolution.
>
> Although the Bolsheviks held large support in urban areas, 
> they had many foreign and domestic enemies that refused to recognize their government. 
> 
> Russia erupted into a bloody civil war, which pitted the Reds (Bolsheviks), 
> against their enemies, which included non-Russian independence movements, 
> anti-Bolshevik socialist parties, anarchists, monarchists and liberals; 
> the latter two parties strongly supported the Russian White movement 
> which was led mainly by right-leaning officers of the Russian Empire 
> and was generally seen as fighting for the restoration of the old imperial order. 
> 
> In response, the Bolshevik commissar Leon Trotsky began 
> organizing workers' militias loyal to the Bolsheviks into the Red Army. 
> While key events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, every city in the empire was convulsed, 
> including the provinces of national minorities, 
> and in the rural areas peasants took over and redistributed land.
>
> As the war progressed, the RSFSR began to establish Soviet power 
> in the newly independent republics that seceded from the Russian Empire. 
> The RSFSR initially focused its efforts on the newly independent republics of Armenia, 
> Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine. 
> Wartime cohesion and intervention from foreign powers prompted the RSFSR 
> to begin unifying these nations under one flag 
> and created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). 
> 
> Historians generally consider the end of the revolutionary period to be in 1922, 
> when the Russian Civil War concluded with the defeat of the White Army 
> and most separatist factions, leading to mass emigration from Russia. 
> The victorious Bolshevik Party reconstituted itself into the All-Union Communist Party 
> (Bolsheviks) and would remain in power for the next six decades.
