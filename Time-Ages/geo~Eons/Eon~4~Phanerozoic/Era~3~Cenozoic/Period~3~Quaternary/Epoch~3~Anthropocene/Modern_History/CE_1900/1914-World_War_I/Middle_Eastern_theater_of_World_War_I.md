> The combatants were, 
> - on one side, the Ottoman Empire (including the majority of Kurdish tribes and Circassians, and the relative majority of Arabs), with some assistance from the other Central Powers; 
> - and on the other side, the British (with the help of a small number of Jews, Greeks, Armenians, some Kurdish tribes and Arab states, along with Hindu, Sikh and Muslim colonial troops from India) as well as troops from the British Dominions of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, the Russians (with the help of Armenians, Assyrians, and occasionally some Kurdish tribes), and the French (with its North African and West African Muslim, Christian and other colonial troops) from among the Allied Powers. 
> 
> There were five main campaigns: 
> - the Sinai and Palestine, 
> - Mesopotamian, 
> - Caucasus,

> and the Armenian militia who participated in the Armenian resistance 
> supported by Russia during the War; along with Armenian volunteer units, 
> the Armenian militia formed the Armenian Corps of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918. 
> In addition, the Assyrians joined the Allies and saw action in Southeastern Turkey, 
> northern Mesopotamia (Iraq), northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria 
> following the Assyrian genocide, instigating the Assyrian war of independence. 
> 
> Turks were persecuted by the invading Russian troops in the east 
> and by Greek troops and Armenian fedayis in the west, east, and south of Anatolia. 
> The theatre covered the largest territory of all theatres in the war.
>
> Russian participation in the theatre ended as a result of the Armistice of Erzincan (1917-12-05), 
> after which the revolutionary Russian government withdrew from the war 
> under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918). 
> 
> The Armenians attended the Trebizond Peace Conference (14 March 1918) 
> which resulted in the Treaty of Batum on 4 June 1918.

> and signed the Treaty of SÃ¨vres on 10 August 1920 and later the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923.
