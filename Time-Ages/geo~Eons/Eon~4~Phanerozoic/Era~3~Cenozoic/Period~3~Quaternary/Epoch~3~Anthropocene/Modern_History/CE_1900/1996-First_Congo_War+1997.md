> The First Congo War, also known as Africa's First World War, 
> was a civil and international military conflict that lasted from 24 October 1996 to 16 May 1997, 
> primarily taking place in Zaire 
> (which was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the conflict). 
> 
> The war resulted in the overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, 
> who was replaced by rebel leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila. 
> This conflict, which also involved multiple neighboring countries, 
> set the stage for the Second Congo War (1998–2003) 
> due to tensions between Kabila and his former allies.
>
> By 1996, Zaire was in a state of political and economic collapse, exacerbated by long-standing internal strife and the destabilizing effects of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which had led to the influx of refugees and militant groups into the country. The Zairean government under Mobutu, weakened by years of dictatorship and corruption, was unable to maintain control, and the army had deteriorated significantly. With Mobutu terminally ill and unable to manage his fractured government, loyalty to his regime waned. The end of the Cold War further reduced Mobutu's international support, leaving his regime politically and financially bankrupt.
>
> The war began when Rwanda invaded eastern Zaire in 1996 to target rebel groups that had sought refuge there. This invasion expanded as Uganda, Burundi, Angola, and Eritrea joined, while an anti-Mobutu coalition of Congolese rebels formed. Despite efforts to resist, Mobutu's regime quickly collapsed, with widespread violence and ethnic killings occurring throughout the conflict. Hundreds of thousands died as the government forces, supported by Sudanese troops, were overwhelmed.
>
> After Mobutu's ousting, Kabila's government renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, his regime remained unstable, as he sought to distance himself from his former Rwandan and Ugandan backers. In response, Kabila expelled foreign troops and forged alliances with regional powers such as Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. These actions prompted a second invasion from Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the Second Congo War in 1998. Some historians and analysts view the First and Second Congo Wars as part of a continuous conflict with lasting effects that continue to affect the region today.
