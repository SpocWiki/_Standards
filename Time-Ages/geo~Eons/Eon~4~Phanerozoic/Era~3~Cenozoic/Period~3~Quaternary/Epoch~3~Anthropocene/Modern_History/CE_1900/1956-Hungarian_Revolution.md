> The **Hungarian Revolution of 1956** (23 October – 4 November 1956; 
> Hungarian: 1956-os forradalom), also known as the Hungarian Uprising, 
> was an attempted countrywide revolution 
> against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic (1949–1989) 
> and the policies caused by the government's subordination to the Soviet Union (USSR). 
> 
> The uprising lasted 15 days before being crushed by Soviet tanks and troops on 7 November 1956 
> (outside of Budapest firefights lasted until at least 12 November 1956). 
> Thousands were killed or wounded, and nearly a quarter of a million Hungarians fled the country.
>
> The Hungarian Revolution began on 23 October 1956 in Budapest 
> when university students appealed to the civil populace 
> to join them at the Hungarian Parliament Building 
> to protest against the USSR's geopolitical domination of Hungary 
> through the Stalinist government of Mátyás Rákosi. 
> A delegation of students entered the building of Magyar Rádió 
> to broadcast their sixteen demands for political and economic reforms to civil society, 
> but were detained by security guards. 
> 
> When the student protestors outside the radio building demanded the release of their delegation, 
> a group of police from the ÁVH (State Protection Authority) fatally shot several of the students.
>
> Consequently, Hungarians organized into revolutionary militias to fight against the ÁVH; 
> local Hungarian communist leaders and ÁVH policemen were captured and summarily executed; 
> and political prisoners were released and armed. 
> To realize their political, economic, and social demands, 
> local soviets (councils of workers) assumed control of municipal government 
> from the Hungarian Working People's Party (Magyar Dolgozók Pártja). 
> The new government of Imre Nagy disbanded the ÁVH, 
> declared Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, 
> and pledged to re-establish free elections. 
> 
> By the end of October the intense fighting had subsided.
>
> Although initially willing to negotiate the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Hungary, 
> the USSR repressed the Hungarian Revolution on 4 November 1956, 
> and fought the Hungarian revolutionaries until Soviet victory on 10 November; 
> repression of the Hungarian Uprising killed 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet Army soldiers, 
> and compelled 200,000 Hungarians to seek political refuge abroad, mostly to Austria.
