> The **Sturmabteilung** ([ˈʃtʊʁmʔapˌtaɪlʊŋ] ; SA; lit. 'Storm Division' or loosely 'stormtroopers') 
> was the original paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler 
> and the Nazi Party of Germany. 
> 
> It played a significant role in Hitler's rise to power in the 1920s and early 1930s. 
> Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, 
> disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, 
> fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, 
> especially the Roter Frontkämpferbund of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) 
> and the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), 
> and intimidating Romani, trade unionists, and especially Jews.
>
> The SA were colloquially called Brownshirts (Braunhemden) 
> because of the colour of their uniform's shirts, 
> similar to Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts. 
> 
> The official SA uniform was a brown shirt with a brown tie. 
> The colour came about because a large shipment of Lettow-shirts, 
> originally intended for the German colonial troops 
> in Germany's former East Africa colony but which never reached its destination 
> because of naval blockades, was purchased in 1921 
> by Gerhard Roßbach for use by his Freikorps paramilitary unit. 
> 
> They were later used for his Schill Youth organization in Salzburg, 
> and in 1924 were adopted by the Schill Youth in Germany. 
> 
> The "Schill Sportversand" then became the main supplier for the SA's brown shirts. 
> The SA developed pseudo-military titles for its members, 
> with ranks that were later adopted by several other Nazi Party groups.
>
> After Hitler rose to Nazi Party leadership in 1921, 
> he formalized the party's militant supporters into the SA 
> as a group that was to protect party gatherings. 
> 
> In 1923, owing to his growing distrust of the SA, 
> Hitler ordered the creation of a bodyguard unit, 
> which was abolished after the failed Beer Hall Putsch later that year. 
> 
> Not long after Hitler's release from prison, 
> he ordered the creation of another bodyguard unit in 1925 
> that ultimately became the Schutzstaffel (SS). 
> 
> During the Night of the Long Knives (die Nacht der langen Messer) purge in 1934, 
> the SA's then-leader Ernst Röhm was arrested and executed. 
> 
> The SA continued to exist but lost almost all its influence 
> and was effectively superseded by the SS, which took part in the purge. 
> 
> The SA remained in existence 
> until after Nazi Germany's final capitulation to the Allies in 1945, 
> after which it was disbanded and outlawed by the Allied Control Council.
