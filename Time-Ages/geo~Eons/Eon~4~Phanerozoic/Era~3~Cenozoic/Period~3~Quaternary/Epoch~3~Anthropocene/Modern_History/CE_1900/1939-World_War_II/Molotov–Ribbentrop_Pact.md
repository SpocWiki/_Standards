## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, officially the Treaty of Non-Aggression 
> between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 
> and also known as the Hitler–Stalin Pact and the Nazi–Soviet Pact, 
> was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, 
> with a secret protocol establishing Soviet and German spheres of influence across Eastern Europe. 
> 
> The pact was signed in Moscow on 24 August 1939 (backdated 23 August 1939) 
> by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov 
> and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop.  
>
> Tripartite discussions between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France had broken down 
> after the Soviet Union was excluded from the Munich Agreement in September 1938. 
> 
> Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 
> had indicated that the USSR was willing to support Czechoslovakia militarily 
> if France did so as well. 
> 
> Subseqently, rapprochement between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany began in early 1939. 
> 
> The treaty was the culmination of negotiations for an economic agreement 
> between the USSR and Nazi Germany which the Soviets used 
> to obtain a political agreement – see Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–1941).
> 
> On 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to finalize the treaty, 
> which the Soviets had sought before with Britain and France. 
> The Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, signed the next day, guaranteed peace between the parties 
> and was a commitment neither government would aid or ally itself with an enemy of the other. 
> In addition to the publicly announced stipulations of non-aggression for the next 10 years, 
> the treaty included the Secret Protocol, 
> which defined the borders of Soviet and German spheres of influence 
> across Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland. 
> 
> The secret protocol also recognized the interest of Lithuania in the Vilnius region, 
> and Germany declared its complete uninterest in Bessarabia. 
> The rumoured existence of the Secret Protocol was proven only 
> when it was made public during the Nuremberg trials.
>
> Soon after the pact, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. 
> Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, 
> one day after a Soviet–Japanese ceasefire came into effect after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, 
> and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union 
> approved the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. 
>
> After the invasions, the new border between the two countries was confirmed 
> by the supplementary protocol of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. 
> In March 1940, parts of the Karelia and Salla regions in Finland 
> were annexed by the Soviet Union following the Winter War. 
> The Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania 
> and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region) followed. 
> The Soviets used concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians 
> as a pretext for their invasion of Poland. 
> Stalin's invasion of [[Bukovina]] in 1940 violated the pact, 
> since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.
>
> The territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union following the 1939 Soviet invasion 
> east of the Curzon line remained in the Soviet Union after the war 
> and are now in Ukraine and Belarus. 
> Vilnius was given to Lithuania. Only Podlaskie 
> and a small part of Galicia east of the San River, around Przemyśl, were returned to Poland. 
>
> Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940, 
> those detached from Finland (Western Karelia, Petsamo), 
> Estonia (Estonian Ingria and Petseri County) and Latvia (Abrene) remain part of Russia, 
> the successor state to the Russian SFSR 
> and the Soviet Union after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. 
> 
> The territories annexed from Romania were also integrated into the Soviet Union 
> (such as the Moldavian SSR, or oblasts of the Ukrainian SSR). 
> The core of Bessarabia now forms Moldova. 
> Northern Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region 
> now form the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. 
> Southern Bessarabia is part of the Odessa Oblast, which is also now in Ukraine.
>
> The pact was terminated on 22 June 1941, 
> when Germany launched [[Operation_Barbarossa]] and invaded the Soviet Union, 
> in pursuit of the ideological goal of Lebensraum. 
> The Anglo-Soviet Agreement succeeded it. 
> After the war, Ribbentrop was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials 
> and executed. Molotov died in 1986.
