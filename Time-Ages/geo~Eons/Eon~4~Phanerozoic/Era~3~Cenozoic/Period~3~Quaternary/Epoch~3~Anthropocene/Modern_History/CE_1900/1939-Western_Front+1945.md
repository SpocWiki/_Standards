> The Western Front was a military theatre of World War II encompassing 
> Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. 
> 
> The Italian front is considered a separate but related theatre. 
> The Western Front's 1944–1945 phase 
> was officially deemed the European Theater by the United States, 
> whereas Italy fell under the Mediterranean Theater along with the North African campaign. 
> 
> The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. 
> The first phase saw the capitulation of Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. The second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive strategic air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945 with its invasion.
