> **Operation Barbarossa** (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa; 
> Russian: Операция Барбаросса, romanized: Operatsiya Barbarossa) 
> was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and many of its Axis allies, 
> starting on Sunday, 22 June 1941, during the Second World War. 
> It was the largest and costliest land offensive in human history, 
> with around 10 million combatants taking part, 
> and over 8 million casualties by the end of the operation.
>
> The operation, code-named after [[Frederick Barbarossa]] ("red beard"), 
> a 12th-century Holy Roman Emperor and Crusader, 
> put into action Nazi Germany's ideological goals of eradicating communism, 
> and conquering the western Soviet Union to repopulate it with Germans. 
> The German Generalplan Ost aimed to use some of the conquered people as forced labour 
> for the Axis war effort while acquiring the oil reserves of the Caucasus 
> as well as the agricultural resources of various Soviet territories, 
> including [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. 
> Their ultimate goal was to create more Lebensraum (living space) for Germany, 
> and the eventual extermination of the native Slavic peoples 
> by mass deportation to Siberia, Germanisation, enslavement, and genocide.
>
> In the two years leading up to the invasion, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union 
> signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. 
> Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, 
> the German High Command began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 
> (under the code-name Operation Otto). 
> Over the course of the operation, over 3.8 million personnel of the Axis powers—
> the largest invasion force in the history of warfare—
> invaded the western Soviet Union along a 2,900-kilometer (1,800 mi) front, 
> with 600,000 motor vehicles and over 600,000 horses for non-combat operations. 
> The offensive marked a massive escalation of World War II, 
> both geographically and with the Anglo-Soviet Agreement, 
> which brought the USSR into the Allied coalition.
>
> The operation opened up the Eastern Front, 
> in which more forces were committed than in any other theatre of war in human history. 
> The area saw some of history's largest battles, most horrific atrocities, 
> and highest casualties (for Soviet and Axis forces alike), 
> all of which influenced the course of World War II 
> and the subsequent history of the 20th century. 
> 
> The German armies eventually captured some five million Soviet Red Army troops 
> and deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed 3.3 million Soviet prisoners of war, 
> and millions of civilians, as the "Hunger Plan" worked to solve German food shortages 
> and exterminate the Slavic population through starvation. 
> Mass shootings and gassing operations, carried out by German death squads 
> or willing collaborators, murdered over a million Soviet Jews as part of the Holocaust.
>
> The failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of Nazi Germany. 
> Operationally, German forces achieved significant victories 
> and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union 
> (mainly in Ukraine) and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. 
> 
> Despite these early successes, the German offensive came to an end 
> during the Battle of Moscow near the end of 1941, 
> and the subsequent Soviet winter counteroffensive 
> pushed the Germans about 250 km (160 mi) back. 
> 
> German high command anticipated a quick collapse of Soviet resistance as in Poland, 
> analogous to the reaction Russia had during WWI. 
> However, no such collapse occurred, and 
> instead the Red Army absorbed the German Wehrmacht's strongest blows 
> and bogged it down in a [[../../../../../../../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/War_of_Attrition]] for which the Germans were unprepared. 
> 
> Following the heavy losses and logistical strain of Barbarossa, 
> the Wehrmacht's diminished forces could no longer attack along the entire Eastern Front, 
> and subsequent operations to retake the initiative and drive deep into Soviet territory—
> such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943—
> were smaller in strength and eventually failed, which resulted in the Wehrmacht's defeat. 
> These Soviet victories ended Germany's territorial expansion 
> and presaged the eventual collapse of the Nazi German state in 1945.
