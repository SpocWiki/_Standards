## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The war on terror, officially the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), 
> is a global military campaign initiated by the United States 
> in response to the September 11 attacks in 2001. 
> 
> A global conflict spanning multiple wars, 
> some researchers and political scientists have argued that it replaced the Cold War.
>
> The main targets of the campaign were 
> militant Islamist movements such as al-Qaeda, the Taliban and their allies. 
> 
> Other major targets included the Ba'athist regime in Iraq, 
> which was deposed in an invasion in 2003, 
> and various militant factions that fought during the ensuing insurgency. 
> 
> Following its territorial expansion in 2014, 
> the Islamic State also emerged as a key adversary of the United States.
>
> The term "war on terror" uses war as a metaphor to describe a variety of 
> actions which fall outside the traditional definition of war. 
> 
> U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term "war on terrorism" on 16 September 2001, 
> and then "war on terror" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress. 
> 
> Bush indicated the enemy of the war on terror as 
> "a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them". 
> 
> The initial conflict was aimed at al-Qaeda, with the main theater in Afghanistan and Pakistan, 
> a region that would later be referred to as "AfPak". 
> 
> The term "war on terror" was immediately criticized by individuals including 
> Richard Myers, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
> and eventually more nuanced terms came to be used by the Bush administration to define the campaign. 
> 
> While "war on terror" was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations, 
> a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal was and is issued by the U.S. Armed Forces.
>
> According to the Costs of War Project, the post-9/11 wars of the campaign 
> have displaced 38 million people, 
> the second largest number of forced displacements of any conflict since 1900, 
> and caused more than 4.5 million deaths (direct and indirect) in 
> Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. 
> They also estimate that it has cost the U.S. Treasury over $8 trillion.
>
> While support for the "war on terror" was high among the American public 
> during its initial years, it had become deeply unpopular by the late 2000s. 
> 
> Controversy over the war has focused on its morality, casualties, and continuity, 
> with critics questioning government measures that infringed civil liberties and human rights. 
> 
> Critics have notably described the Patriot Act as "Orwellian" 
> due to its substantial expansion of the federal government's surveillance powers. 
> 
> Controversial practices of coalition forces have been condemned, including 
> drone warfare, surveillance, torture, extraordinary rendition and various war crimes. 
> 
> The participating governments have been criticized for implementing 
> authoritarian measures, repressing minorities, fomenting Islamophobia globally, 
> and causing negative impacts to health and environment. 
> 
> Security analysts assert that there is no military solution to the conflict, 
> pointing out that terrorism is not an identifiable enemy, 
> and have emphasized the importance of negotiations and political solutions 
> to resolve the underlying roots of the crises.
