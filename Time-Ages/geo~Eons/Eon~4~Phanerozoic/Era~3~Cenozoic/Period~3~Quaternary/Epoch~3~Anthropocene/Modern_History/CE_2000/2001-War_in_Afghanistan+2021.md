> The war in Afghanistan was a prolonged armed conflict lasting from 2001 to 2021. 
> It began with an invasion by a United States–led coalition 
> under the name Operation Enduring Freedom in response to the September 11 attacks 
> carried out by the Taliban-allied and Afghanistan-based al-Qaeda. 
> 
> The Taliban were expelled from major population centers 
> by American-led forces supporting the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, 
> thus toppling the Taliban-ruled Islamic Emirate. 
> 
> Three years later, the American-sponsored Islamic Republic was established, 
> but by then the Taliban, led by founder Mullah Omar, had reorganized 
> and begun an insurgency against the Afghan government and coalition forces. 
> The conflict ended almost twenty years later as 
> the 2021 Taliban offensive reestablished the Islamic Emirate. 
> It was the longest war in United States military history, 
> surpassing the Vietnam War by six months.
>
> Following the September 11 attacks, masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, 
> American president George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban immediately 
> extradite him to the United States and close down al-Qaeda's camps in Afghanistan; 
> the Taliban refused and demanded evidence of bin Laden's guilt 
> before offering to hand him over to a neutral country. 
> 
> The U.S. dismissed these offers and proceeded with the invasion. 
> After expelling the Taliban and their allies, 
> the American-led coalition remained in Afghanistan, 
> forming the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)—sanctioned by the United Nations
> —with the goal of creating a new democratic authority in the country 
> that would prevent the Taliban from returning to power. 
> 
> A new Afghan Interim Administration was established, 
> and international rebuilding efforts were launched. 
> 
> By 2003, the Taliban had reorganized and launched a widespread 
> insurgency against the new Afghan government and coalition forces. 
> Insurgents from the Taliban and other Islamist groups waged asymmetric warfare, 
> fighting with guerrilla warfare in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets, 
> and reprisals against perceived Afghan collaborators. 
> 
> By 2007, large parts of Afghanistan had been retaken by the Taliban. 
> In response, the coalition sent a major influx of troops for counter-insurgency operations, 
> with a "clear and hold" strategy for villages and towns; this influx peaked in 2011, 
> when roughly 140,000 foreign troops were operating under ISAF command across Afghanistan.
>
> An American covert operation in neighboring Pakistan 
> led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, 
> and NATO leaders began planning an exit strategy from Afghanistan. 
> 
> On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations in Afghanistan 
> and officially transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government. 
> 
> Unable to eliminate the Taliban through military means, 
> coalition forces (and separately, the Afghan government led by Ashraf Ghani) 
> turned to diplomacy to end the conflict. 
> 
> These efforts culminated in the United States–Taliban deal in February 2020, 
> which stipulated the withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan by 2021. 
> 
> In exchange, the Taliban pledged to prevent any militant group 
> from staging attacks from Afghan territory against the US and its allies. 
> 
> However, the Afghan government was not a party to the deal and rejected its terms. 
> Coinciding with the withdrawal of troops, 
> the Taliban launched a broad offensive throughout the summer of 2021, 
> successfully reestablishing their control over Afghanistan, 
> including the capital city of Kabul on 15 August. 
> 
> On the same day, the last president of the Islamic Republic, Ashraf Ghani, fled the country; 
> the Taliban declared victory and the war was formally brought to a close. 
> 
> By 30 August, the last American military aircraft departed from Afghanistan, 
> ending the protracted American-led military presence in the country.
>
> Overall, the war killed an estimated 176,000–212,000+ people, including 46,319 civilians. 
> In addition, 66,650 people were killed in the related War in North-West Pakistan. 
> While more than 5.7 million former refugees returned to Afghanistan after the 2001 invasion, 
> by the time the Taliban returned to power in 2021, 2.6 million Afghans remained refugees, 
> while another 4 million were internally displaced.
