## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Orange Revolution 
> (Ukrainian: Помаранчева революція, romanized: Pomarancheva revoliutsiia) 
> was a series of protests that led to political upheaval in Ukraine 
> from late November 2004 to January 2005. 
> 
> It gained momentum primarily due to the initiative of the general population, 
> sparked by the aftermath of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election run-off 
> which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption, voter intimidation and electoral fraud. 
> 
> Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was the focal point of the movement's campaign of civil resistance, 
> with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily. 
> Nationwide, this was highlighted by a series of acts of civil disobedience, sit-ins, 
> and general strikes organized by the opposition movement.
>
> The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych were rigged by the authorities in favour of the latter. The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by Ukraine's Supreme Court for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be "free and fair". The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych's 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kyiv, the Orange Revolution ended. In the following years, the Orange Revolution had a negative connotation among pro-government circles in Belarus and Russia.
>
> In the 2010 presidential election, Yanukovych became Yushchenko's successor as President of Ukraine after the Central Election Commission and international observers declared that the presidential election was conducted fairly.
