> The Bronze Age is a historic period, lasting approximately from 3300 BC to 1200 BC. 
> Characterized by the use of bronze, the presence of writing in some areas, 
> and other early features of urban civilization, the Bronze Age is the second principal period 
> of the three-age system proposed in 1836 by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen 
> for classifying and studying ancient societies and history. 
> It is also considered the second phase of three, in the Metal Ages.
>
> An ancient civilisation is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age if it either 
> - produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, 
> - or traded other items for bronze from producing areas elsewhere. 
>
> Bronze is harder and more durable than the other metals available at the time, 
> allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.
>
> While terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, 
> the higher temperature required for smelting, 1,250 °C (2,280 °F), 
> in addition to the greater difficulty of working with the metal, 
> placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC. 
> 
> Tin's low melting point of 231.93 °C (449.47 °F) 
> and copper's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 °C (1,985 °F) 
> placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic pottery kilns, which date back to 6,000 BC 
> and were able to produce temperatures of at least 900 °C (1,650 °F). 
> 
> Copper and tin ores are rare, since there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia 
> before trading in bronze began in the 3rd millennium BC. 
> Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the Neolithic period, 
> with the Chalcolithic serving as a transition.
>
> Bronze Age cultures differed in their development of writing. 
> According to archaeological evidence, cultures in Mesopotamia (cuneiform script) and Egypt (hieroglyphs) developed the earliest practical writing systems.
>
> The Bronze Age is said to have ended with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], 
> a time of widespread societal collapse during the 12th century BC, 
> mostly between c. 1200 and 1150. 
> The collapse affected a large area of the Eastern Mediterranean 
> (North Africa and Southeast Europe) and the Near East, 
> in particular Egypt, eastern Libya, the Balkans, the Aegean, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. 
> 
> It was sudden, violent, and culturally disruptive for many Bronze Age civilizations, 
> and it brought a sharp economic decline to regional powers, notably ushering in the Greek Dark Ages.
> 
> Bronze Age cultures were the first to develop writing. 
> According to archaeological evidence, cultures 
> - in Mesopotamia, which used cuneiform script, 
> - and Egypt, which used hieroglyphs, developed the earliest practical writing systems.  
> 
> In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead, 
> which does not include a Bronze Age, though some cultures there did smelt copper and bronze. 
> Indigenous metalworking arrived in Australia with European contact.
>
> In many areas bronze continued to be rare and expensive, 
> mainly because of difficulties in obtaining enough tin, which occurs in relatively few places, 
> unlike the very common copper.  
> 
> Some societies appear to have gone through much of the Bronze Age 
> using bronze only for weapons or elite art, such as Chinese ritual bronzes, 
> with ordinary farmers largely still using stone tools.  
> 
> However, this is hard to assess as the rarity of bronze meant it was __keenly recycled__.
