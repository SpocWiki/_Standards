> The Information Age is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century. 
> It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, 
> as established during the Industrial Revolution, 
> to an economy centered on information technology. 
> 
> The onset of the Information Age has been linked to the development of the transistor in 1947. 
> This technological advance has had a significant impact on the way information is processed and transmitted.
>
> According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, 
> the Information Age was formed by capitalizing on computer miniaturization advances, 
> which led to modernized information systems and internet communications as the driving force of social evolution.
>
> There is ongoing debate concerning whether the Third Industrial Revolution has already ended, 
> and if the Fourth Industrial Revolution has already begun 
> due to the recent breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. 
> 
> This next transition has been theorized to harken the advent of the Imagination Age, 
> the Internet of things (IoT), and rapid advances in machine learning.
