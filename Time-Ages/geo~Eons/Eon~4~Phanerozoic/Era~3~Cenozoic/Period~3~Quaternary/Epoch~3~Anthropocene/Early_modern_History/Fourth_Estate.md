> The term **fourth estate** or fourth power refers to the press and news media 
> in their explicit capacity, beyond the reporting of news, of wielding influence in politics. 
> The derivation of the term arises from the traditional European concept of the three estates of the realm: 
> - the clergy, 
> - the nobility, and 
> - the commoners.
>
> The equivalent term "fourth power" is somewhat uncommon in English, 
> but it is used in many European languages, including German (Vierte Gewalt), Italian (quarto potere),  Spanish (Cuarto poder), French (Quatrième pouvoir), Swedish (tredje statsmakten [Third Estate]), Polish (Czwarta Władza),  and Russian (четвёртая власть) 
> to refer to a government's separation of powers into 
> - legislative (Parliament), 
> - executive/administrative (Ministriey), and 
> - judicial branches (Courts).
>
> The expression has also been applied to lawyers, 
> to the British Queen Consort (acting as a free agent independent of her husband), 
> and to the proletariat. 
> But, generally, the term "Fourth Estate" refers to the press and media, 
> emphasizing its role in monitoring and influencing the other branches of government and society.
>
> A Fifth Estate, while not recognized in the same way as the first four, 
> includes bloggers, social media influencers, and other online platforms 
> that can influence public discourse and politics independently of traditional media.
