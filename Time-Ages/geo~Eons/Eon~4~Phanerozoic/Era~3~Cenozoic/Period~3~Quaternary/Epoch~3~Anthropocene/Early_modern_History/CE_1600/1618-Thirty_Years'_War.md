> The **Thirty Years' War**, from 1618 to 1648, was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. 
> Fought primarily in Central Europe, an estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died 
> from the effects of battle, famine, or disease, 
> while parts of Germany reported population declines of over 50%. 
> Related conflicts include the Eighty Years' War, the War of the Mantuan Succession, 
> the Franco-Spanish War, the Torstenson War, the Dutch-Portuguese War, 
> and the Portuguese Restoration War.
>
> The war can be seen as a continuation of the religious conflict 
> initiated by the 16th-century Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire. 
> The 1555 Peace of Augsburg attempted to resolve this 
> by dividing the Empire into Catholic and Lutheran states, 
> but over the next 50 years the expansion of Protestantism beyond these boundaries destabilised the settlement. 
>
> However, while differences over religion and Imperial authority 
> were important factors in causing the war, some contemporary commentators suggest 
> its scope and extent were driven by the contest for European dominance 
> between Habsburg-ruled Spain and Austria, and the French House of Bourbon.
>
> Its outbreak is generally traced to 1618, when Emperor Ferdinand II was deposed as king of Bohemia 
> and replaced by the Protestant Frederick V of the Palatinate. 
> Although Imperial forces quickly suppressed the Bohemian Revolt, 
> Frederick's participation expanded the fighting into the Palatinate, 
> whose strategic importance drew in the Dutch Republic and Spain, then engaged in the Eighty Years' War. 
> 
> In addition, the acquisition of territories within the empire by rulers like Christian IV of Denmark 
> and Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden gave them and other foreign powers an ongoing motive to intervene. 
> Combined with fears the Protestant religion in general was threatened, 
> what started as an internal dynastic dispute became a European conflict.
>
> The period from 1618 to 1635 was primarily a civil war within the Holy Roman Empire, 
> with support from external powers. 
> 
> After 1635, the empire became one theatre in a wider struggle between France, 
> chiefly supported by Sweden, and Emperor Ferdinand III, whose principal ally was Spain. 
> 
> Fighting ended with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, 
> the terms of which included greater autonomy within the empire for states like Bavaria and Saxony, 
> as well as acceptance of Dutch independence by Spain. 
> The conflict shifted the balance of power in favour of France, 
> and set the stage for the expansionist wars of Louis XIV which dominated Europe for the next sixty years.
