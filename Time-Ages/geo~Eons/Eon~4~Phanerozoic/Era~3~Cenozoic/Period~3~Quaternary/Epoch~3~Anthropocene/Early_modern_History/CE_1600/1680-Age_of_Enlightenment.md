## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Age of Enlightenment** (also the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment) 
> was an intellectual and philosophical movement taking place in Europe 
> from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. 
>
> The Enlightenment, which valued knowledge gained through rationalism and empiricism, 
> was concerned with a range of social ideas and political ideals such as natural law, liberty, and progress, 
> toleration and fraternity, constitutional government, and the formal separation of church and state.
>
> The __Enlightenment was preceded by and overlapped the Scientific Revolution__, 
> which included the work of Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon, 
> Pierre Gassendi, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton, among others, 
> as well as the rationalist philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and John Locke. 
>
> Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment to the publication of 
> René Descartes' [[Discourse on the Method]] in 1637, 
> with his method of systematically disbelieving everything 
> unless there was a well-founded reason for accepting it, 
> and featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum ("I think, therefore I am"). 
>
> Others cite the publication of Isaac Newton's [[Principia Mathematica]] (1687) 
> as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. 
> 
> European historians traditionally dated its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 
> and its end with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. 
> Many historians now date the __end of the Enlightenment__ as the start of the 19th century, 
> with the latest proposed year being the __death of Immanuel Kant in 1804__. 
> In reality, historical periods do not have clearly defined start or end dates.
>
> Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas 
> through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses 
> and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. 
> 
> The ideas of the Enlightenment __undermined the authority of the monarchy and religious officials__ 
> and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. 
> A variety of 19th-century movements, including liberalism, socialism, and neoclassicism, 
> trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment. 
> The scientific racism also has a background in this period.
>
> The Enlightenment was marked by an increasing awareness 
> of the relationship between the mind and the everyday media of the world, 
> and by an emphasis on the scientific method and reductionism, 
> along with increased questioning of religious dogma — 
> an attitude captured by Kant's essay Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?, 
> where the phrase sapere aude ('dare to know') can be found.
>
> The central doctrines of the Enlightenment were individual liberty, representative government, 
> the rule of law, and religious freedom, in contrast to an absolute monarchy or single party state 
> and the religious persecution of faiths other than those formally established 
> and often controlled outright by the State. 
> 
> By contrast, other intellectual currents included arguments in favour of anti-Christianity, Deism, 
> and even Atheism, accompanied by demands for secular states, bans on religious education, 
> suppression of Monasteries, the suppression of the Jesuits, and the expulsion of religious orders. 
> 
> Contemporary criticism, particularly of these anti-religious concepts, 
> has since been dubbed the Counter-Enlightenment by Sir Isaiah Berlin.
