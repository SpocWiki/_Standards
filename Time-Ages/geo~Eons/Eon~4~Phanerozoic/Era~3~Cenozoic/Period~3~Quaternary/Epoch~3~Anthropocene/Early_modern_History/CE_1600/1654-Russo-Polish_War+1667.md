## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Polish–Russian War of 1654–1667 was a major conflict 
> between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
> Between 1655 and 1660, the Swedish invasion 
> was also fought in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth 
> and so the period became known as "The Deluge".
>
> The Commonwealth initially suffered defeats, 
> but it regained its ground and won several decisive battles. 
> However, its plundered economy was not able to fund the long conflict. 
> 
> Facing internal crisis and civil war, the Commonwealth was forced to sign a truce. 
> The war ended with significant Russian territorial gains 
> and marked the beginning of the rise of Russia as a great power in Eastern Europe.
