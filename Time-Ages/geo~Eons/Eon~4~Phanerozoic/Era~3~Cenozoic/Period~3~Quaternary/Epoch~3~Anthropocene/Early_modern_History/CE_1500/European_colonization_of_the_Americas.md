## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> During the Age of Discovery, a large scale colonization of the Americas, involving European countries, 
> took place primarily between the late 15th century and early 19th century. 
> 
> The Norse settled areas of the North Atlantic, colonizing Greenland 
> and creating a short-term settlement near the northern tip of Newfoundland circa 1000 AD. 
> 
> However, due to its long duration and importance, 
> the later colonization by Europeans, after Christopher Columbus’s voyages, is more well-known. 
> 
> During this time, the European colonial empires of Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, 
> Russia, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden began to explore and claim the Americas, 
> its natural resources, and human capital, leading to the displacement, disestablishment, 
> enslavement, and genocide of the Indigenous peoples in the Americas, 
> and the establishment of several settler colonial states.
>
> The rapid rate at which some European nations grew in wealth and power 
> was unforeseeable in the early 15th century 
> because it had been preoccupied with internal wars 
> and it was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the Black Death. 
> 
> The Ottoman Empire's domination of trade routes to Asia 
> prompted Western European monarchs to search for alternatives, 
> resulting in the voyages of Christopher Columbus 
> and his accidental arrival at the New World. 
> 
> With the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, 
> Portugal and Spain agreed to divide the Earth in two, 
> with Portugal having dominion over non-Christian lands in the world's eastern half, 
> and Spain over those in the western half. 
> 
> Spanish claims essentially included all of the Americas; 
> however, the Treaty of Tordesillas granted the eastern tip of South America to Portugal, 
> where it established Brazil in the early 1500s, 
> and the East Indies to Spain, where It established the Philippines. 
> 
> The city of Santo Domingo, in the current-day Dominican Republic, founded in 1496 by Columbus, 
> is credited as the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the Americas.
>
> By the 1530s, other Western European powers realized 
> they too could benefit from voyages to the Americas, 
> leading to British and French colonization in the northeast tip of the Americas, 
> including in the present-day United States. 
> 
> Within a century, the Swedish established New Sweden; 
> the Dutch established New Netherland; 
> and Denmark–Norway along with the Swedish and Dutch 
> established colonization of parts of the Caribbean. 
> 
> By the 1700s, Denmark–Norway revived its former colonies in Greenland, 
> and Russia began to explore and claim the Pacific Coast from Alaska to California. 
> Russia began colonizing the Pacific Northwest in the mid-18th century, seeking pelts for the fur trade. 
> 
> Many of the social structures—including religions, political boundaries, and linguae francae—
> which predominate in the Western Hemisphere in the 21st century 
> are the descendants of those that were established during this period.
>
> Violent conflicts arose during the beginning of this period 
> as indigenous peoples fought to preserve their territorial integrity from increasing European colonizers 
> and from hostile indigenous neighbors who were equipped with European technology. 
> 
> Conflict between the various European colonial empires and the American Indian tribes 
> was a leading dynamic in the Americas into the 1800s, 
> although some parts of the continent gained their independence from Europe by then, 
> countries such as the United States continued to fight against Indian tribes 
> and practiced settler colonialism. 
> 
> The United States for example practiced a settler colonial policy of Manifest destiny and Indian removal. 
> 
> Other regions, including California, Patagonia, the North Western Territory, 
> and the northern Great Plains, experienced little to no colonization at all until the 1800s. 
> 
> European contact and colonization 
> had disastrous effects on the indigenous peoples of the Americas and their societies.
