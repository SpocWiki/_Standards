1775–1783 war between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies, 
which won independence as the United States of America

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783), 
> also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, 
> was the armed conflict that comprised the final eight years of the broader American Revolution, 
> in which American Patriot forces organized as the Continental Army 
> and commanded by George Washington defeated the British Army. 
> The conflict was fought in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. 
> 
> The war's outcome seemed uncertain for most of the war. 
> But Washington and the Continental Army's decisive victory in the Siege of Yorktown in 1781 
> led King George III and the Kingdom of Great Britain to negotiate an end to the war 
> in the Treaty of Paris two years later, in 1783, 
> in which the British monarchy acknowledged the independence of the Thirteen Colonies, 
> leading to the establishment of the United States as an independent and sovereign nation.
>
> In 1763, after the British Empire gained dominance in North America 
> following its victory over the French in the Seven Years' War, 
> tensions and disputes began escalating between the British and the Thirteen Colonies, 
> especially following passage of Stamp and Townshend Acts. 
> 
> The British Army responded by seeking to occupy Boston militarily, 
> leading to the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. 
> In mid-1774, with tensions escalating even further between the British Army and the colonies, 
> the British Parliament imposed the Intolerable Acts, an attempt to disarm Americans, 
> leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, 
> the first battles of the Revolutionary War. 
> 
> In June 1775, the Second Continental Congress voted to 
> incorporate colonial-based Patriot militias into a central military, the Continental Army, 
> and unanimously appointed Washington its commander-in-chief. 
> 
> Two months later, in August 1775, 
> the British Parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion. 
> 
> In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress formalized the war, 
> passing the Lee Resolution on July 2, and, two days later, 
> unanimously adopting the Declaration of Independence, on July 4.
>
> In March 1776, in an early win for the newly-formed Continental Army 
> under Washington's command, following a successful siege of Boston, 
> the Continental Army successfully drove the British Army out of Boston. 
> 
> British commander in chief William Howe responded by 
> launching the New York and New Jersey campaign, 
> which resulted in Howe's capture of New York City in November. 
> Washington responded by clandestinely crossing the Delaware River 
> and winning small but significant victories at Trenton and Princeton.
>
> In the summer of 1777, as Howe was poised to capture Philadelphia, 
> the Continental Congress fled to Baltimore. 
> In October 1777, a separate northern British force under the command of John Burgoyne 
> was forced to surrender at Saratoga in an American victory that proved crucial in 
> convincing France and Spain that an independent United States was a viable possibility. 
> 
> France signed a commercial agreement with the rebels, 
> followed by a Treaty of Alliance in February 1778. 
> In 1779, the Sullivan Expedition undertook a scorched earth campaign against the Iroquois 
> who were largely allied with the British. 
> Indian raids on the American frontier, however, continued to be a problem. 
> Also, in 1779, Spain allied with France against Great Britain in the Treaty of Aranjuez, 
> though Spain did not formally ally with the Americans.
>
> Howe's replacement Henry Clinton 
> intended to take the war against the Americans into the Southern Colonies. 
> Despite some initial success, British General Cornwallis was 
> besieged by a Franco-American force in Yorktown in September and October 1781. 
> Cornwallis was forced to surrender in October. 
> The British wars with France and Spain continued for another two years, 
> but fighting largely ceased in North America. 
> 
> In the Treaty of Paris, ratified on September 3, 1783, 
> Great Britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States, 
> bringing the American Revolutionary War to an end. 
> The Treaties of Versailles resolved Great Britain's conflicts with France and Spain 
> and forced Great Britain to cede Tobago, Senegal, and small territories in India to France, 
> and Menorca, West Florida, and East Florida to Spain.
