## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The War of the Austrian Succession, 1740 to 1748, 
> was a conflict between the European great powers, 
> fought primarily in Europe, the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. 
> 
> Related conflicts include King George's War, the War of Jenkins' Ear, 
> the First Carnatic War, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.
>
> Its immediate cause was the **right of Maria Theresa to inherit Austria**. 
> This was challenged by a coalition between France, Prussia, and Bavaria, 
> while Maria Theresa was backed by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, 
> and Hanover, collectively known as the Pragmatic Allies. 
> 
> The conflict later drew in other participants, including 
> Spain, Savoy, Saxony, Sweden, and Russia.
>
> Fighting began when 
> Prussia occupied the wealthy Austrian province of Silesia in December 1740. 
> 
> Neither side was able to achieve a decisive victory and despite success in the Austrian Netherlands, by early 1748 France was close to bankruptcy due to the cost of the war and a crippling British naval blockade. This led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in October which confirmed Maria Theresa in her titles, but many signatories were unhappy with the terms. In return for vast expenditure, France gained very little, although their Spanish ally made minor gains in Italy and repelled a British invasion of South America.
>
> British insistence that Austria cede Silesia to Prussia as part of the peace undermined the long-standing Anglo-Austrian Alliance, while the latter felt they received little benefit from the enormous subsidies paid to Austria during the war. This led to the realignment known as the Diplomatic Revolution, and ultimately the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756.
