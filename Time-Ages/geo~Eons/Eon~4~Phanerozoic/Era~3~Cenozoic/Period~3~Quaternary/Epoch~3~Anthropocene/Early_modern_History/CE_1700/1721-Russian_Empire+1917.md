## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Russian Empire was an empire that spanned most of northern Eurasia 
> from its establishment in November 1721 
> until the proclamation of the Russian Republic in September 1917. 
> 
> At its height in the late 19th century, it covered about 22,800,000 km2 (8,800,000 sq mi), 
> roughly one-sixth of the world's landmass, making it the third-largest empire in history, 
> behind only the British and Mongol empires. 
> 
> It also colonized Alaska between 1799 and 1867. 
> The empire's 1897 census, the only one it conducted, 
> found a population of 125.6 million 
> with considerable ethnic, linguistic, religious, and socioeconomic diversity.
>
> From the 10th to 17th century, the Russians had been ruled by a noble class 
> known as the boyars, above whom was the tsar, the absolute monarch. 
> 
> The groundwork of the Russian Empire was laid by Ivan III who ruled from 1462 to 1505, 
> and greatly expanded his domain, established a centralized Russian national state, 
> and secured independence against the Tatars. 
> 
> His grandson, Ivan IV (r. 1533–1584), became 
> in 1547 the first Russian monarch to be crowned tsar of all Russia. 
> Between 1550 and 1700, the Russian state grew by an average of 35,000 km2 per year. 
> 
> Peter I transformed the tsardom into an empire, 
> and fought numerous wars that turned a vast realm into a major European power. 
> He moved the Russian capital from Moscow to the new model city of Saint Petersburg, 
> and led a cultural revolution that introduced a modern, scientific, rationalist, 
> and Western-oriented system. 
> 
> Catherine the Great (r. 1762–1796) presided over further expansion of the Russian state 
> by conquest, colonization, and diplomacy, 
> while continuing Peter's policy of modernization. 
> 
> Alexander I (r. 1801–1825) helped defeat the militaristic ambitions of Napoleon 
> and subsequently constituted the Holy Alliance, 
> which aimed to restrain the rise of secularism and liberalism across Europe. 
> 
> Russia further expanded to the west, south, and east, 
> strengthening its position as a European power. 
> 
> Its victories in the Russo-Turkish Wars 
> were later checked by defeat in the Crimean War (1853–1856), 
> leading to a period of reform and conquests in Central Asia. 
> Alexander II (r. 1855–1881) initiated numerous reforms, 
> most notably the 1861 emancipation of all 23 million serfs.
>
> By the start of the 19th century, Russian territory extended 
> from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea in the south, and from the Baltic Sea in the west to Alaska, Hawaii, and California in the east. 
> 
> By the end of the 19th century, Russia had expanded its control over the Caucasus, 
> most of Central Asia and parts of Northeast Asia. 
> 
> Notwithstanding its extensive territorial gains and great power status, 
> the empire entered the 20th century in a perilous state. 
> 
> The devastating Russian famine of 1891–1892 killed hundreds of thousands 
> and led to popular discontent. 
> 
> As the last remaining absolute monarchy in Europe, 
> the empire saw rapid political radicalization 
> and the growing popularity of revolutionary ideas such as communism. 
> After the Russian Revolution of 1905, 
> Tsar Nicholas II authorized the creation of a national parliament, the State Duma, 
> although he still retained absolute political power.
>
> When Russia entered the First World War on the side of the Allies, 
> it suffered a series of defeats 
> that further galvanized the population against the emperor. 
> 
> In 1917, mass unrest among the population and mutinies in the army 
> culminated in the February Revolution, which led to the abdication of Nicholas II, 
> the formation of the Russian Provisional Government, 
> and the proclamation of the first Russian Republic. 
> 
> Political dysfunction, continued involvement in the widely unpopular war, 
> and widespread food shortages 
> resulted in mass demonstrations against the government in July. 
> 
> The republic was overthrown in the October Revolution by the Bolsheviks, 
> who proclaimed the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic 
> and whose Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended Russia's involvement in the war, 
> but who nevertheless were opposed by various factions known collectively as the Whites. 
> 
> After emerging victorious in the Russian Civil War, 
> the Bolsheviks established the Soviet Union across most of the Russian territory; 
> Russia was one of four continental European empires 
> to collapse as a result of World War I, 
> along with Germany, Austria–Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.
