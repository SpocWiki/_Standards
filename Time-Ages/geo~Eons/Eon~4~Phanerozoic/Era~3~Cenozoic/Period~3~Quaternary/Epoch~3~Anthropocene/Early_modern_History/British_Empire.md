## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **British Empire** comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, 
> and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. 
> 
> It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts 
> established by England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. 
> At its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it became the largest empire in human history 
> and, for a century, was the foremost global power. 
> 
> By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 
> 23 percent of the world population at the time, 
> and by 1920, it covered 35.5 million km2 (13.7 million sq mi), 24 per cent of the Earth's total land area. 
> As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread. 
> At the peak of its power, it was described as "the empire on which the sun never sets", 
> as the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.
>
> During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, 
> Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe, 
> and in the process established large overseas empires. 
> 
> Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands 
> began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. 
> A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France 
> left Britain the dominant colonial power in North America. 
> Britain became a major power in the Indian subcontinent 
> after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.
>
> The American War of Independence resulted in Britain 
> losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies in North America by 1783. 
> While retaining control of British North America (now Canada) 
> and territories in and near the Caribbean in the British West Indies, 
> British colonial expansion turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. 
> 
> After the defeat of France in the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), 
> Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century 
> and expanded its imperial holdings. 
> 
> It pursued trade concessions in China and Japan, and territory in Southeast Asia. 
> The Great Game and Scramble for Africa also ensued. 
> The period of relative peace (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon 
> was later described as Pax Britannica (Latin for "British Peace"). 
> 
> Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its colonies, 
> its dominance of much of world trade, and of its oceans, 
> meant that it effectively controlled the economies of, 
> and readily enforced its interests in, many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. 
> It also came to dominate the Middle East. 
> 
> Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, 
> some of which were formally reclassified as Dominions by the 1920s. 
> 
> By the start of the 20th century, 
> Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead. 
> Military, economic and colonial tensions between Britain and Germany 
> were major causes of the First World War, during which Britain relied heavily on its empire. 
> The conflict placed enormous strain on its military, financial, and manpower resources. 
> Although the empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the First World War, 
> Britain was no longer the world's preeminent industrial or military power.
>
> In the Second World War, 
> Britain's colonies in East Asia and Southeast Asia were occupied by the Empire of Japan. 
> Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, 
> the damage to British prestige and the British economy helped accelerate the decline of the empire. 
> 
> India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, 
> achieved independence in 1947 as part of a larger decolonisation movement, 
> in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire. 
> 
> The Suez Crisis of 1956 confirmed Britain's decline as a global power, 
> and the handover of Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997 
> symbolised for many the end of the British Empire, 
> though fourteen overseas territories that are remnants of the empire remain under British sovereignty. 
> 
> After independence, many former British colonies, along with most of the dominions, 
> joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states. 
> Fifteen of these, including the United Kingdom, retain the same person as monarch, 
> currently King Charles III.
