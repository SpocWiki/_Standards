## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy 
> used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the Middle Ages to early modern Europe. 
> Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.
>
> The best known system is the French Ancien RÃ©gime (Old Regime), 
> a three-estate system which was made up of 
> - a First Estate of clergy, 
> - a Second Estate of titled nobles, and 
> - a **Third Estate** of all other subjects (both peasants and bourgeoisie).
>
> In some regions, notably Sweden and Russia, 
> - burghers (the urban merchant class) and 
> -  rural commoners were split into separate estates, 
> creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate.
>
> In Norway, the taxpaying classes were considered as one, and with a very small aristocracy; 
> this class/estate was as powerful as the monarchy itself. 
> 
> In Denmark, however, only owners of large tracts of land had any influence. 
> Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights.
>
> In England, a two-estate system evolved that 
> - combined nobility and clergy into one lordly estate 
> - with "commons" as the second estate. 
> This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
>
> In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), knights, and burghers was used; this system excluded lower clergy and peasants altogether.
>
> In Scotland, the Three Estates were the Clergy (First Estate), Nobility (Second Estate), and Shire Commissioners, or "burghers" (Third Estate), 
> representing the bourgeoisie and lower commoners. The Estates made up a Scottish Parliament.
>
> Today, the terms three estates and estates of the realm may sometimes be re-interpreted 
> to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the 
> - legislature, 
> - administration/executive, and 
> - the judiciary. 
> The modern term of the [[Fourth_Estate]] invokes medieval three-estate systems, 
> and usually refers to some particular force outside that medieval power structure, 
> most commonly the independent press or the mass media.
