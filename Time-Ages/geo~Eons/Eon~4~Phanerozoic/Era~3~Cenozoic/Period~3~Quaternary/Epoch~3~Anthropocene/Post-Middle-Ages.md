> Post-medieval archaeology is a term used in Europe 
> to describe the study of the material past over the last 500 years. 
> 
> The field is also referred to as historical archaeology, a term originating in North America, 
> and common in countries impacted by European colonialism. 
> 
> It is closely related to __industrial archaeology__ and contemporary archaeology. 
> Many scholars have found a connection between post-medieval 
> and contemporary archaeology particularly in how scholars can view their archaeological study 
> and apply in their own present contexts. 
> 
> It is also crucial by studying both post-medieval and contemporary archaeology 
> that it can benefit the future of archaeology, 
> particularly as scholars can apply the studies in more recent periods as time progresses. 
>
> Initially post-medieval archaeology did not extend its studies past the mid 18th century, 
> though as a result of subsequent critiques within the field this cut-off date has been discarded, 
> and the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology, 
> Europe's leading professional society for the period, now explicitly considers its remit 
> to be "the archaeology of the post-medieval world up to the present day and beyond".
>
> The emergence of post-medieval archaeology began in the second half of the 20th century 
> by exploring primarily European cultures such as Germany, France, The Mediterranean, 
> and Scandinavia. 
> 
> This was done after World War II, where archaeology was primarily 
> focused on richer countries in Europe such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. 
> Ever since then, there has been an emergence in studying post-medieval archaeology 
> which has expanded along with the expansion of access to education 
> and differing educational studies. 
> 
> This emergence of archaeology has also expanded the field of archaeological study 
> and has allowed further study in the field of archaeology.
>
> The traditional date for the beginning of the post-medieval period in Britain has been 1485 when, 
> following the Battle of Bosworth, the Tudor dynasty took the throne. 
> In practice, the medieval period is now often extended into the reign of the Tudor monarchs 
> and the boundary between the two eras is not precise. 
> 
> As with all attempts to neatly periodise the archaeological record, 
> efforts to impose an exact date on the transition are doomed to be questioned by current and new findings. 
> 
> As there is the urge to learn more about post-medieval archaeology in Europe, 
> there is an additional urge to explore post-medieval archaeology in the wider world. 
> Archaeologists and historians are hoping to expand the study of post-medieval archaeology 
> to help better learn about the way of life after the medieval period.
>
> Given the relatively strong historical record running alongside the archaeological one, 
> post-medieval archaeology is often strongly positioned 
> to study the effects of known social and political change. 
> 
> The immediacy of the period means that it appeals in fields such as genealogy 
> as well as to students of social history.
>
> Post-medieval sites include Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, the Rose Theatre in London 
> and Fort Amherst in Chatham.
