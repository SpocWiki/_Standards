## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ancient history** is a time period 
> from the beginning of writing and recorded human history through late antiquity. 
> The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 years, 
> beginning with the development of Sumerian cuneiform script. 
> 
> Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC – AD 500, 
> ending with the expansion of Islam in late antiquity. 
> 
> The three-age system periodises ancient history into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, 
> with recorded history generally considered to begin with the Bronze Age. 
> The start and end of the three ages vary between world regions. 
> In many regions the Bronze Age is generally considered to begin a few centuries prior to 3000 BC, 
> while the end of the Iron Age varies from the early first millennium BC in some regions 
> to the late first millennium AD in others.
>
> During the time period of ancient history, the world population was already exponentially increasing 
> due to the Neolithic Revolution, which was in full progress. 
> While in 10,000 BC, the world population stood at 2 million, it rose to 45 million by 3000 BC. 
> By the Iron Age in 1000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. 
> By the end of the ancient period in AD 500, world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. 
> In 10,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times.
