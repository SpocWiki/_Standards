> The Bell **Beaker Culture**, also known as the Bell Beaker complex or Bell Beaker phenomenon, 
> is an archaeological culture named after the inverted-bell beaker drinking vessel 
> used at the beginning of the European Bronze Age, arising from around 2800 BC. 
> The term's English translation Bell Beaker was introduced by John Abercromby in 1904.
>
> Bell Beaker culture lasted in Britain from c. 2450 BC, with the appearance of single burial graves, 
> until as late as 1800 BC, but in continental Europe only until 2300 BC, 
> when it was succeeded by the Únětice culture. 
> The culture was widely dispersed throughout Western Europe, 
> being present in many regions of Iberia and stretching eastward to the Danubian plains, 
> and northward to the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, 
> and was also present in the islands of Sardinia and Sicily 
> and some coastal areas in north-western Africa. 
> The Bell Beaker phenomenon shows substantial regional variation, 
> and a study from 2018 found that it was associated with genetically diverse populations.
>
> In its early phase, the Bell Beaker culture can be seen as 
> the western contemporary of the Corded Ware culture of Central Europe. 
> From about 2400 BC the Beaker folk culture expanded eastwards, 
> into the Corded Ware horizon. 
> In parts of Central and Eastern Europe, as far east as Poland, 
> a sequence occurs from Corded Ware to Bell Beaker. 
> This period marks a period of cultural contact in Atlantic and Western Europe 
> following a prolonged period of relative isolation during the Neolithic.
>
> In its mature phase, the Bell Beaker culture is understood as 
> not only a collection of characteristic artefact types, 
> but a complex cultural phenomenon involving metalwork in copper, arsenical bronze and gold, 
> long-distance exchange networks, archery, specific types of ornamentation, 
> and (presumably) shared ideological, cultural and religious ideas, 
> as well as [[social stratification]] and the emergence of regional elites. 
> 
> A wide range of regional diversity persists within the widespread late Beaker culture, 
> particularly in local burial styles (including incidences of cremation rather than burial), 
> housing styles, economic profile, and local ceramic wares (Begleitkeramik).
