## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In the history of Europe, the **Middle Ages** or medieval period lasted approximately 
> from the 5th to the late 15th centuries, similarly to the post-classical period of global history. 
>
> It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance 
> and the Age of Discovery. 
> The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: 
> - classical antiquity, the 
> - medieval period, and the 
> - modern period. 
>
> The medieval period is itself subdivided into the 
> - [[Middle_Ages/0750-Early_Middle-Ages|Early Middle Ages]], 
> - [[Middle_Ages/1000-High_Middle-Ages|High Middle Ages]], and 
> - [[Middle_Ages/1300-Late_Middle-Ages|Late Middle Ages]].
>
> Population decline, counterurbanisation, the collapse of centralised authority, invasions, 
> and mass migrations of tribes, which had begun in late antiquity, continued into the Early Middle Ages. 
> The large-scale movements of the Migration Period, including various Germanic peoples, 
> formed new kingdoms in what remained of the Western Roman Empire. 
>
> In the 7th century, North Africa and the Middle East—once part of the Byzantine Empire—
> came under the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate, an Islamic empire, 
> after conquest by Muhammad's successors. 
> 
> Although there were substantial changes in society and political structures, 
> the break with classical antiquity was incomplete. 
> The still-sizeable [[Late_Antiquity/CE_0300/0395-Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine Empire]], Rome's direct continuation, survived in the Eastern Mediterranean 
> and remained a major power. The empire's law code, the Corpus Juris Civilis or "Code of Justinian", 
> was rediscovered in Northern Italy in the 11th century. 
> In the West, most kingdoms incorporated the few extant Roman institutions. 
> Monasteries were founded as campaigns to Christianise the remaining pagans across Europe continued. 
> The Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty, briefly established the Carolingian Empire 
> during the later 8th and early 9th centuries. 
> It covered much of Western Europe but later succumbed to the pressures of internal civil wars 
> combined with external invasions: 
> - Vikings from the north, 
> - Magyars from the east, and 
> - Saracens from the south.
>
> During the [[Middle_Ages/1000-High_Middle-Ages|High Middle Ages]], which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased significantly 
> as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish 
> and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. 
> Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, 
> and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service 
> to their overlords in return for the right to rent from lands and manors, 
> were two of the ways society was organised in the [[Middle_Ages/1000-High_Middle-Ages|High Middle Ages]].
>
> This period also saw the collapse of the unified Christian church with the East–West Schism of 1054. 
> The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians 
> to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. 
> Kings became the heads of centralised nation-states, reducing crime and violence 
> but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. 
> 
> Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, 
> and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, 
> the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, 
> and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements 
> toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.
>
> The Late Middle Ages was marked by difficulties and calamities, including famine, plague, and war, 
> which significantly diminished the population of Europe; 
> between 1347 and 1350, the Black Death killed about a third of Europeans. 
> Controversy, heresy, and the Western Schism within the Catholic Church paralleled the interstate conflict, 
> civil strife, and peasant revolts that occurred in the kingdoms. 
> Cultural and technological developments transformed European society, 
> concluding the Late Middle Ages and beginning the early modern period.
