## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Northern Crusades or Baltic Crusades were Christianization campaigns 
> undertaken by Catholic Christian military orders and kingdoms, 
> primarily against the pagan Baltic, Finnic, and West Slavic peoples 
> around the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.
>
> The most notable campaigns were the Livonian and Prussian crusades. 
> Some of these wars were called crusades during the Middle Ages; 
> however, others, including the 12th century First Swedish Crusade 
> and several following military incursions by Scandinavian Christians 
> against the then pagan Finns, 
> were dubbed "crusades" only in the 19th century by romantic nationalist historians. 
> However, crusades against Estonians and against "other pagans in those parts" 
> were authorized by Pope Alexander III in the crusade bull Non parum animus noster, in 1171 or 1172.
