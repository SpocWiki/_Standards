> The Mississippian culture was a collection of Native American societies 
> that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States 
> from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, varying regionally. 
> 
> It was known for building large, earthen platform mounds, and often other shaped mounds as well. 
> 
> It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages 
> linked together by loose trading networks. 
> The largest city was Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center, 
> located in what is present-day southern Illinois.
>
> The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley. 
> Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley 
> may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point. 
> 
> Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539â€“1540 
> (when Hernando de Soto explored the area), 
> with notable exceptions being Natchez communities. 
> These maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.
