## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states 
> took place from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century. 
> 
> The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine–Ottoman wars, 
> waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century 
> before entering Europe in the mid-14th century with the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars. 
> 
> The mid-15th century saw the Serbian–Ottoman wars and the Albanian-Ottoman wars. 
> Much of this period was characterized by the Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. 
> The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, 
> culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.
>
> The Ottoman–Venetian wars spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. 
> This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470, the siege of Malta in 1565, 
> the fall of Famagusta (Cyprus) in 1571, 
> the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 
> (at that time the largest naval battle in history), the fall of Candia (Crete) in 1669, 
> the Venetian reconquest of Morea (Peloponnese) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715. 
> The island of Venetian-ruled Corfu remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans.
>
> In the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans 
> and formed the Holy League, reversing a number of Ottoman land gains 
> during the Great Turkish War of 1683–99. 
> 
> Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals 
> until the second half of the eighteenth century.
>
> In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection 
> from their Serbian (1804–1817), Greek (1821–1832) and Romanian (1877–1878) subjects. 
> This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars, which further destabilized the empire. 
> 
> The final retreat of Ottoman rule began with the First Balkan War (1912–1913), 
> and culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres after World War I, 
> leading to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.
