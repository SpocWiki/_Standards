> The Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War, also known as the Great Teutonic War, 
> occurred between 1409 and 1411 between the Teutonic Knights 
> and the allied Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. 
> 
> Inspired by the local Samogitian uprising, 
> the war began with a Teutonic invasion of Poland in August 1409. 
> As neither side was ready for a full-scale war, 
> Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia brokered a nine-month truce.
>
> After the truce expired in June 1410, 
> the military-religious monks were decisively defeated in the Battle of Grunwald, 
> one of the largest battles in medieval Europe. 
> Most of the Teutonic leadership was killed or taken prisoner. 
> 
> Although they were defeated, 
> the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege on their capital in Marienburg (Malbork) 
> and suffered only minimal territorial losses in the Peace of Thorn (1411). 
> Territorial disputes lasted until the Peace of Melno of 1422.
>
> However, the Knights never recovered their former power, 
> and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts 
> and economic decline in their lands. 
> 
> The war shifted the balance of power in Central Europe 
> and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant power in the region.
