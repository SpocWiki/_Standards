> Vlad III, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler (Romanian: Vlad Țepeș [ˈvlad ˈtsepeʃ]) 
> or Vlad Dracula (Romanian: Vlad Drăculea [ˈdrəkule̯a]; 1428/31 – 1476/77), 
> was Voivode of Wallachia three times between 1448 and his death in 1476/77. 
> 
> He was regarded as a hero in Romania due to his opposition to the Ottoman Empire 
> and he is considered an important ruler in Wallachian history.
>
> He was the second son of Vlad Dracul, who became the ruler of Wallachia in 1436. 
> Vlad and his younger brother, Radu, were held as hostages in the Ottoman Empire 
> in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. 
> 
> Vlad's eldest brother Mircea and their father were murdered 
> after John Hunyadi, regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. 
> Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, Vladislav II, as the new voivode. 
> Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, 
> and Vladislav accompanied him. 
> 
> Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned, 
> and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. 
> Vlad went to Moldavia in 1449 or 1450 and later to Hungary.
>
> Relations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, 
> and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. 
> 
> After killing Vladislav, Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars 
> to strengthen his position. 
> 
> He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported 
> his opponents, Dan and Basarab Laiotă (who were Vladislav's brothers), 
> and Vlad's illegitimate half-brother, Vlad Călugărul. 
> 
> Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia, 
> where he had them impaled (which inspired his epithet). 
> Peace was restored in 1460.
>
> The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, 
> but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. 
> 
> In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, 
> massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Muslim Bulgarians. 
> 
> Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia 
> to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. 
> 
> Vlad attempted to capture the sultan at Târgoviște during the night of 16–17 June 1462. 
> The Sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, 
> but many Wallachians deserted Vlad’s forces and joined Radu. 
> Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from Matthias Corvinus, 
> King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.
>
> Vlad was held in captivity in Visegrád from 1463 to 1475. 
> During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. 
> 
> He was released at the request of Stephen III of Moldavia in the summer of 1475. 
> Vlad was reputedly forced to convert to Roman Catholicism 
> (from Russian Orthodoxy) as part of the agreement for his release. 
> 
> He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. 
> Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiotă 
> (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. 
> 
> Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. 
> Vlad was killed in battle near Snagov before 10 January 1477.
>
> Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among 
> the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. 
> 
> In Russia, popular stories suggested that 
> Vlad was able to strengthen his central government only 
> by applying brutal punishments, 
> and many 19th-century Romanian historians adopted a similar view. 
> 
> Vlad's patronymic inspired the name of Bram Stoker's literary vampire, Count Dracula.
