> The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a period of regional cooling, 
> particularly pronounced in the North Atlantic region. 
> 
> It was not a true ice age of global extent. 
> The term was introduced into scientific literature by FranÃ§ois E. Matthes in 1939. 
> The period has been conventionally defined as extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, 
> but some experts prefer an alternative time-span from about 1300 to about 1850.
>
> The NASA Earth Observatory notes three particularly cold intervals. 
> One began about 1650, another about 1770, and the last in 1850, 
> all of which were separated by intervals of slight warming. 
> 
> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report 
> considered that the timing and the areas affected by the LIA suggested largely independent 
> regional climate changes, rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation. 
> At most, there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period.
>
> Several causes have been proposed: cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened volcanic activity, 
> changes in the ocean circulation, variations in Earth's orbit and axial tilt (orbital forcing), 
> inherent variability in global climate, and decreases in the human population 
> (such as from the massacres by Genghis Khan, the Black Death 
> and the epidemics emerging in the Americas upon European contact).
