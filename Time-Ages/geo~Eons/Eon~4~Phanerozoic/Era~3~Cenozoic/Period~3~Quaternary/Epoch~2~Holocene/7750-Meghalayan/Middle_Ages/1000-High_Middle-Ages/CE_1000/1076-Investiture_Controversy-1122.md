> The Investiture Controversy or Investiture Contest (Latin: Controversia de Investitura, German: Investiturstreit, pronounced [ɪnvɛstiˈtuːɐ̯ˌʃtʁaɪt] ) 
> was a conflict between the Church and the state in medieval Europe 
> over the ability to choose and install bishops (investiture), abbots of monasteries, 
> and the Pope himself. 
> 
> A series of popes in the 11th and 12th centuries 
> undercut the power of the Holy Roman Emperor and other European monarchies, 
> and the controversy led to nearly 50 years of conflict.
>
> It began as a power struggle between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV 
> (then King, later Holy Roman Emperor) in 1076. 
> The conflict ended in 1122, when Pope Callixtus II and Emperor Henry V 
> agreed on the Concordat of Worms.  
> 
> The agreement required bishops to swear an oath of fealty to the secular monarch, 
> who held authority "by the lance" but left selection to the church. 
> It affirmed the right of the church to invest bishops with sacred authority, symbolized by a ring and staff. In Germany (but not Italy and Burgundy), the Emperor also retained the right to preside over elections of abbots and bishops by church authorities, and to arbitrate disputes. Holy Roman Emperors renounced the right to choose the Pope.
>
> In the meantime, there was also a brief but significant investiture struggle between Pope Paschal II and King Henry I of England from 1103 to 1107. The earlier resolution to that conflict, the Concordat of London, was very similar to the Concordat of Worms.
