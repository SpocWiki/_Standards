> The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition 
> (Spanish: Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición) 
> was established in 1478 by the Catholic Monarchs, 
> King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile and lasted until 1834. 
> 
> It began toward the end of the Reconquista and aimed to maintain Catholic orthodoxy 
> and **replace the Medieval Inquisition**, which was under papal control. 
>
> According to some modern estimates, 
> around 150,000 people were prosecuted for various offences during the period.  
> 3,000-5,000 were executed, particularly in the initial 50 years, mostly by burning at the stake. 
> 
> Other punishments included penance and public flogging, exile, enslavement on galleys, 
> and prison terms from years to life, together with the confiscation of all property. 
>
> The Inquisition was originally intended primarily 
> to identify heretics among those who converted from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism. 
> 
> The regulation of the faith of newly converted Catholics intensified 
> following royal decrees issued in 1492 and 1502 
> ordering Jews and Muslims to either convert to Catholicism, leave Castile or face death. 
> 
> Hundreds of thousands of forced conversions, torture and executions, 
> the persecution of conversos and moriscos, 
> and the mass expulsions of Jews and Muslims from Spain all followed.  
> 
> An estimated 40,000–100,000 Jews were expelled in 1492. 
> Conversos were subjected to blood purity statutes (limpieza de sangre), 
> which introduced racially-based discrimination and antisemitism, 
> lasting into the 19th and 20th centuries.
>
> The inquisition expanded to other domains under the Spanish Crown, 
> including Southern Italy and the Americas, while also targeting those accused of 
> alumbradismo, Protestantism, witchcraft, blasphemy, bigamy, sodomy, Freemasonry, etc. 
> 
> A notable feature was the auto-da-fe, where the accused were paraded, sentences read, and confessions made, after which the guilty were turned over to civil authorities for the execution of sentences.
