> The Golden Horde, self-designated as Ulug Ulus (lit. 'Great State' in Turkic), 
> was originally a Mongol and later Turkicized khanate established in the 13th century 
> and originating as the northwestern sector of the Mongol Empire. 
> 
> With the division of the Mongol Empire after 1259, it became a functionally separate khanate. 
> It is also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi, 
> and replaced the earlier, less organized Cuman–Kipchak confederation.
>
> It originally consisted of the lands bequeathed to Jochi (d. 1225).  
> It greatly grew in size under Batu Khan, the founder of the Blue Horde. 
> After Batu's death in 1255, his dynasty flourished for a full century, 
> until 1359, though the intrigues of Nogai instigated a partial civil war in the late 1290s. 
> 
> The Horde's military power peaked during the reign of Özbeg Khan (1312–1341), who adopted Islam. 
> The territory of the Golden Horde at its peak extended from Siberia and Central Asia 
> to parts of Eastern Europe from the Urals to the Danube in the west, 
> and from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea in the south, 
> while bordering the Caucasus Mountains and the territories of the Mongol dynasty known as the Ilkhanate.
>
> The khanate experienced violent internal political disorder known as the Great Troubles (1359–1381), 
> before it briefly reunited under Tokhtamysh (1381–1395). 
> However, soon after the 1396 invasion of Timur, the founder of the Timurid Empire, 
> the Golden Horde broke into smaller Tatar khanates which declined steadily in power. 
> 
> At the start of the 15th century, the Horde began to fall apart. 
> By 1466, it was being referred to simply as the "Great Horde". 
> Within its territories there emerged numerous predominantly Turkic khanates. 
> These internal struggles allowed Moscow to formally rid itself of the "Tatar yoke" 
> at the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480, 
> which traditionally marks the end of Mongol rule over Russia. 
> 
> The Crimean Khanate and the Kazakh Khanate, the last remnants of the Golden Horde, 
> survived until 1783 and 1847 respectively, when they were conquered by the expanding Russian state.
