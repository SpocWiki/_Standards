> The Fall of Constantinople, also known as the Conquest of Constantinople, 
> was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottoman Empire. 
> The city was captured on 29 May 1453 
> as part of the culmination of a 55-day siege which had begun on 6 April.    
>
> The attacking Ottoman Army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, 
> was commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II (later nicknamed "the Conqueror"), 
> while the Byzantine army was led by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. 
> After conquering the city, 
> Mehmed II made Constantinople the new Ottoman capital, replacing Adrianople.
>
> The fall of Constantinople and of the Byzantine Empire 
> was a watershed of the Late Middle Ages, marking the effective end of the Roman Empire, 
> a state which began in roughly 27 BC and had lasted nearly 1,500 years. 
> 
> For many modern historians, 
> the fall of Constantinople marks the end of the medieval period 
> and the beginning of the early modern period. 
> 
> The city's fall also stood as a turning point in military history. 
> Since ancient times, 
> cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. 
> The walls of Constantinople, especially the Theodosian walls, 
> protected Constantinople from attack for 800 years 
> and were noted as some of the most advanced defensive systems in the world at the time. 
> 
> However, these fortifications were overcome by Ottoman infantry 
> with the support of gunpowder, specifically from cannons and bombards, 
> heralding a change in siege warfare. 
> 
> The Ottoman cannons repeatedly fired massive cannonballs 
> weighing 500 kilograms (1,100 lb) over 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) 
> which created gaps in the Theodosian walls for the Ottoman siege.
