> In modern historiography, ancient Rome encompasses 
> - the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the 8th century BC, 
> - the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), 
> - Roman Republic (509–27 BC), 
> - Roman Empire (27 BC– 395 AD), 
> - and the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD.
> 
> Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, 
> beside the River Tiber in the Italian Peninsula. 
> The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, 
> and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. 
> 
> It eventually controlled the Italian Peninsula, 
> assimilated the Greek culture of southern Italy (Magna Grecia) and the Etruscan culture, 
> becoming a dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. 
> 
> It was among the largest empires in the ancient world, 
> with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants, roughly 20% of the world's population at the time. 
> 
> It covered around 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) at its height in AD 117.
> The Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a classical republic 
> and then to an increasingly autocratic semi-elective military dictatorship during the Empire. 
> 
> Through conquest, cultural, and linguistic assimilation, at its height it controlled 
> - the North African coast, Egypt, 
> - Southern Europe, and 
> - most of Western Europe, 
> - the Balkans, 
> - Crimea, and much of the Middle East, 
> - including Anatolia, Levant, 
> - and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia. 
> 
> It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, 
> and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world.
>
> Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, 
> technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature, architecture, and engineering. 
> 
> Rome professionalised and expanded its military 
> and created a system of government called res publica, 
> the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France. 
> 
> It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats, 
> such as the empire-wide construction of aqueducts and roads, 
> as well as more grandiose monuments and facilities.
