> The **Roman Kingdom**, also referred to as the Roman monarchy or the regal period of ancient Rome, 
> was the earliest period of Roman history when the city and its territory were ruled by kings. 
> 
> According to tradition, the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding c. 753 BC, 
> with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy, 
> and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic c. 509 BC.
>
> Little is certain about the kingdom's history as no records 
> and few inscriptions from the time of the kings have survived. 
> The accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire 
> are thought largely to be based on oral tradition.
