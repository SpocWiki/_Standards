> Cyrus II of Persia (Old Persian: 𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁 Kūruš; c. 600 – 530 BC), known as Cyrus the Great, 
> was the founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. 
> 
> Hailing from Persis, he brought the Achaemenid dynasty to power by defeating the Median Empire 
> and embracing all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanding vastly 
> and eventually conquering most of West Asia and much of Central Asia 
> to create what would soon become the largest polity in human history at the time. 
> 
> The Achaemenid Empire's largest territorial extent was achieved under Darius the Great, 
> whose rule stretched from Southeast Europe in the west to the Indus River valley in the east.
>
> After conquering the Median Empire, 
> Cyrus led the Achaemenids to conquer Lydia and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire. 
> He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major military campaigns 
> that were described as having brought "into subjection every nation without exception"; 
> 
> Cyrus allegedly died in battle with the Massagetae, a nomadic Eastern Iranian tribal confederation, along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC. 
> However, Xenophon of Athens claimed that Cyrus did not die fighting 
> and had instead returned to the city of Pasargadae, 
> which served as the Achaemenid ceremonial capital. 
> 
> He was succeeded by his son Cambyses II, whose campaigns into North Africa 
> led to the conquests of Egypt, Nubia, and Cyrenaica during his short rule.
>
> To the Greeks, he was known as Cyrus the Elder (Κῦρος ὁ Πρεσβύτερος Kŷros ho Presbýteros). 
> Cyrus was particularly renowned among contemporary scholars 
> because of his habitual policy of respecting peoples' customs and religions 
> in the lands that he conquered. 
> 
> He was influential in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae 
> to govern the Achaemenid Empire's satraps, which worked for the profit of both rulers and subjects.
>
> Following the Persian conquest of Babylon, Cyrus issued the Edict of Restoration, 
> in which he authorized and encouraged the return of the Jewish people 
> to what had been the Kingdom of Judah, officially ending the Babylonian captivity. 
> 
> He is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and left a lasting legacy on Judaism 
> due to his role in facilitating the return to Zion, a migratory event in which the Jews 
> returned to the Land of Israel following Cyrus's establishment of Yehud Medinata 
> and subsequently rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem, 
> which had been destroyed by the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. 
> According to Isaiah 45:1, Cyrus was anointed by Yahweh for this task as a biblical messiah; 
> he is the only non-Jewish figure to be revered in this capacity.
>
> In addition to his influence on traditions in both the Eastern and Western worlds, 
> Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy. 
> The Achaemenid Empire's prestige in the ancient world would 
> eventually extend as far west as Athens, 
> where upper-class Greeks adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling Persian class as their own. 
> 
> As the founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, 
> Cyrus played a crucial role in defining the national identity of the Iranian nation; 
> the Achaemenid Empire was instrumental in 
> spreading the ideals of Zoroastrianism as far east as China. 
> 
> He remains a cult figure in Iran, with the Tomb of Cyrus at Pasargadae 
> serving as a spot of reverence for millions of the country's citizens.
