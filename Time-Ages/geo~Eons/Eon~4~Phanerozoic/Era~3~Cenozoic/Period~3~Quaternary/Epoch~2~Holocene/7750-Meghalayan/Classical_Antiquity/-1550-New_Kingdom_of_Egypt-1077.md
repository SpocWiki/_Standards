> The New Kingdom, also called the Egyptian Empire, 
> refers to ancient Egypt between the 16th century BC and the 11th century BC. 
> 
> This period of ancient Egyptian history covers the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasties. 
> Through radiocarbon dating, 
> the establishment of the New Kingdom has been placed between 1570 and 1544 BC. 
> 
> The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period 
> and was succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period. 
> It was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt and marked the peak of its power.
>
> In 1845, the concept of a "New Kingdom" as one of three "golden ages" 
> was coined by German scholar Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen; 
> the original definition would evolve significantly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. 
> 
> The later part of this period, under the Nineteenth Dynasty (1295–1189 BC) and the Twentieth Dynasty (1189–1069 BC), is also known as the Ramesside period. 
> 
> It is named after the eleven pharaohs who took the name Ramesses, 
> after Ramesses I, who founded the Nineteenth Dynasty, 
> and his grandson Ramesses II, who was its longest-reigning monarch.
>
> Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period, 
> the New Kingdom saw a historic expansion into the Levant, 
> thus marking Egypt's greatest territorial extent. 
> 
> Similarly, in response to attacks by the Kushites, 
> who led raids into Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, 
> the rulers of the New Kingdom felt compelled to expand far into Nubia 
> and to hold wider territories in the Near East, particularly on the Levantine frontier.
