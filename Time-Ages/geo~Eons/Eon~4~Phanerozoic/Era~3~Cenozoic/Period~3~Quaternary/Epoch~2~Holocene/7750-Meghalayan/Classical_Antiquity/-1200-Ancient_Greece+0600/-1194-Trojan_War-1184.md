> The Trojan War was a legendary conflict in Greek mythology 
> that took place around the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. 
> 
> The war was waged by the Achaeans (Greeks) against the city of Troy 
> after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. 
> 
> The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology, 
> and it has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably Homer's Iliad. 
> 
> The core of the Iliad (Books II – XXIII) describes a period of four days and two nights 
> in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; 
> the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. 
> 
> Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, 
> which have survived through fragments. 
> 
> Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, 
> and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.
>
> The ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles 
> and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. 
> 
> By the mid-nineteenth century AD, both the war and the city were widely seen as non-historical, 
> but in 1868, the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, 
> who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at what is now Hisarlık in modern-day Turkey. 
> On the basis of excavations conducted by Schliemann and others, 
> this claim is now accepted by most scholars.
>
> The historicity of the Trojan War remains an open question. 
> Many scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale, 
> though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges 
> and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. 
> 
> Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict 
> usually date it to the twelfth or eleventh century BC, 
> often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, 
> which roughly correspond to archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VII, 
> and the Late Bronze Age collapse.
