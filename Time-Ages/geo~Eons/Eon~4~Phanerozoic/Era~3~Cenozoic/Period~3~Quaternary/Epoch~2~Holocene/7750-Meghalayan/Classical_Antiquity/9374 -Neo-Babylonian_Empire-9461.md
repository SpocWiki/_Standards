> The **Neo-Babylonian Empire** or Second Babylonian Empire, 
> historically known as the Chaldean Empire, 
> was the last polity ruled by monarchs native to ancient Mesopotamia. 
> 
> Beginning with the coronation of Nabopolassar as the King of Babylon in 626 BC 
> and being firmly established through the fall of the Assyrian Empire in 612 BC, 
> the Neo-Babylonian Empire was conquered by the Achaemenid Persian Empire in 539 BC, 
> marking the collapse of the Chaldean dynasty less than a century after its founding.
>
> The defeat of the Assyrian Empire and subsequent return of power to Babylon 
> marked the first time that the city, and southern Mesopotamia in general, 
> had risen to dominate the ancient Near East 
> since the collapse of the Old Babylonian Empire (under Hammurabi) 
> nearly a thousand years earlier. 
> 
> The period of Neo-Babylonian rule thus saw unprecedented economic and population growth throughout Babylonia, as well as a renaissance of culture and artwork as Neo-Babylonian kings conducted massive building projects, especially in Babylon itself, bringing back many elements from the previous 2,000 years of Sumero-Akkadian culture.
>
> The Neo-Babylonian Empire retains a notable position in modern cultural memory 
> due to the invidious portrayal of Babylon and its greatest king Nebuchadnezzar II 
> in the Bible. 
> 
> The biblical description of Nebuchadnezzar focuses on his military campaign against the Kingdom of Judah and particularly the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 587 BC, which resulted in the destruction of Solomon's Temple and the subsequent Babylonian captivity. Babylonian sources describe Nebuchadnezzar's reign as a golden age that transformed Babylonia into the greatest empire of its time.
>
> Religious policies introduced by the final Babylonian king Nabonidus, who favoured the moon god SÃ®n over Babylon's patron deity Marduk, eventually served as a casus belli for Persian king Cyrus the Great, who invaded Babylonia in 539 BC by portraying himself as a champion of Marduk divinely restoring order to Mesopotamia. After the conquest, Babylon remained culturally distinct for centuries, with references to people with Babylonian names and to the Babylonian religion known from as late as the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC. Although Babylon revolted several times during the rule of later empires, it never successfully restored its independence.
