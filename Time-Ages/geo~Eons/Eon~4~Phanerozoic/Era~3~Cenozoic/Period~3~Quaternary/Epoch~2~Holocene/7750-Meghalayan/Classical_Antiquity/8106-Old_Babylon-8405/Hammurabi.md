> **Hammurabi** (Old Babylonian Akkadian: 𒄩𒄠𒈬𒊏𒁉, romanized: Ḫâmmurapi c. 1810 –c. 1750 BC), 
> was the sixth Amorite king of the Old Babylonian Empire, reigning from c. 1792 to c. 1750 BC. 
> 
> He was preceded by his father, Sin-Muballit, who abdicated due to failing health. 
> During his reign, he conquered the city-states of Larsa, Eshnunna, and Mari. 
> He ousted Ishme-Dagan I, the king of Assyria, and forced his son Mut-Ashkur to pay tribute, 
> bringing almost all of Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule.
>
> Hammurabi is best known for having issued the Code of Hammurabi, 
> which he claimed to have received from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice. 
> 
> Unlike earlier Sumerian law codes, such as the Code of Ur-Nammu, 
> which had focused on compensating the victim of the crime, 
> the Law of Hammurabi was one of the first law codes 
> to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator. 
> 
> It prescribed specific penalties for each crime and 
> is among the first codes to establish the presumption of innocence. 
> 
> They were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in retribution. 
> The Code of Hammurabi and the Law of Moses in the Torah contain numerous similarities.
>
> Hammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime. 
> After his death, Hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization 
> and forced all peoples to pay obeisance to Marduk, the national god of the Babylonians. 
> 
> Later, his military accomplishments became de-emphasized 
> and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy. 
> 
> For later Mesopotamians, Hammurabi's reign became the 
> frame of reference for all events occurring in the distant past. 
> 
> Even after the empire he built collapsed, he was still revered as a model ruler, 
> and many kings across the Near East claimed him as an ancestor. 
> 
> Hammurabi was rediscovered by archaeologists in the late nineteenth century 
> and has since been seen as an important figure in the history of law.
