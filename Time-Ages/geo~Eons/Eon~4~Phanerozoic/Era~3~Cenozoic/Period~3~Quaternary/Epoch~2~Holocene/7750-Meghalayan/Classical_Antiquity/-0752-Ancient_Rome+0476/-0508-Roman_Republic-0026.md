## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Roman Republic** (Latin: Res publica Romana [ˈreːs ˈpuːblɪka roːˈmaːna]) 
> was the era of classical Roman civilisation 
> beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom (traditionally dated to 509 BC) 
> and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire following the War of Actium. 
> During this period, Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.
>
> Roman society at the time was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and Etruscan societies, 
> as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, 
> which is especially visible in the Ancient Roman religion and its pantheon. 
> 
> Its political organisation developed at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece, 
> with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a senate. 
> There were annual elections, but the republican system was an elective oligarchy, not a democracy; 
> a small number of powerful families largely monopolised the magistracies. 
> 
> Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic 
> to adapt to the difficulties it faced, 
> such as the creation of promagistracies to rule its conquered provinces, 
> and differences in the composition of the senate.
>
> Unlike the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire, throughout the republican era 
> Rome was in a state of near-perpetual war. 
> Its first enemies were its Latin and Etruscan neighbours, as well as the Gauls, who sacked Rome in 387 BC. 
> 
> After the Gallic sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian Peninsula in a century 
> and thus became a major power in the Mediterranean. 
> 
> Its greatest strategic rival was Carthage, against which it waged three wars. 
> Rome defeated Carthage at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, 
> becoming the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. 
> It then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, defeating 
> - Philip V and Perseus of Macedon, 
> - Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire, 
> - the Lusitanian Viriathus, 
> - the Numidian Jugurtha, 
> - the Pontic king Mithridates VI, 
> - Vercingetorix of the Arverni tribe of Gaul, 
> - and the Egyptian queen Cleopatra.
>
> At home, during the Conflict of the Orders, the patricians, the closed oligarchic elite, 
> came into conflict with the more numerous plebs; 
> this was resolved peacefully, with __the plebs achieving political equality by the 4th century BC__. 
> 
> The late Republic, from 133 BC onward, saw substantial domestic strife, 
> often anachronistically seen as a conflict between optimates and populares, 
> referring to conservative and reformist politicians, respectively. 
> 
> The Social War between Rome and its Italian allies over citizenship and Roman hegemony in Italy 
> greatly expanded the scope of civil violence. 
> 
> Mass slavery also contributed to three Servile Wars. 
> Tensions at home coupled with ambitions abroad led to further civil wars. 
> The first involved Marius and Sulla. 
> 
> After a generation, the Republic fell into civil war again in 49 BC between Julius Caesar and Pompey. 
> Despite his victory and appointment as dictator for life, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. 
> Caesar's heir Octavian and lieutenant Mark Antony defeated Caesar's assassins in 42 BC, 
> but they eventually split. 
> 
> Antony's defeat alongside his ally and lover Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, 
> and the Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian as Augustus in 27 BC—
> which effectively made him the first Roman emperor—marked the end of the Republic.
