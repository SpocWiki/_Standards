> Sulla was elected consul for 88 BC. However, amid a dispute over the command of the war against Mithridates of Pontus – initially awarded to Sulla by the Senate but revoked as part of a political deal between Marius and the plebeian tribune Publius Sulpicius – Sulla as consul took his army and marched on Rome. Violently expelling or killing Marius, Sulpicius, and their allies, Sulla left with his army at the close of his consular term to fight Mithridates in Greece. While abroad, Marius returned with Lucius Cornelius Cinna (who succeeded Sulla in the consulship) and they purged their own opponents from the city, including Sulla, whom they declared a public enemy. In the East, Sulla crushed the Pontic armies at the battles of Chaeronea and Orchomenos (86 BC), but offered a generous peace to Mithridates, so he could return to Rome. Although Marius and Cinna had by this point died, Sulla crushed the successors of their faction and won a decisive victory outside Rome at the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC).
>
> Forcibly taking control of Roman politics, Sulla revived the office of dictator, which had been dormant since the Second Punic War, over a century before. Even before his dictatorship he started proscriptions to purge his opponents and, with his dictatorial powers, he reformed Roman constitutional laws to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit the power of the tribunes of the plebs. He resigned his dictatorship at the start of 80 BC and assumed an ordinary consulship for the rest of the year. After that consulship, Sulla retired to private life and died shortly thereafter in 78 BC. Sulla left a lasting impression on the next generation of leaders, such as Pompey and Julius Caesar, who followed his precedent to attain political power through force.
