## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World 
> listed by Hellenic culture. 
> 
> They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering 
> with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, 
> and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. 
> 
> It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, 
> near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. 
> 
> The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word κρεμαστός 
> (kremastós, lit. 'overhanging'), 
> which has a broader meaning than the modern English word "hanging" 
> and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.
>
> According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace 
> known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II 
> (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, 
> because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. 
> 
> This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, 
> a description that was later quoted by Josephus. 
> The construction of the Hanging Gardens 
> has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis 
> and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.
>
> The Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders 
> whose location has not been definitively established. 
> 
> No extant Babylonian texts mention the gardens 
> and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. 
> 
> Three theories have been suggested to account for this: 
> - first, that the gardens were purely mythical, 
>   and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings 
>   (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) 
>   represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden; 
> - second, that they existed in Babylon but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD; and 
> - third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.
