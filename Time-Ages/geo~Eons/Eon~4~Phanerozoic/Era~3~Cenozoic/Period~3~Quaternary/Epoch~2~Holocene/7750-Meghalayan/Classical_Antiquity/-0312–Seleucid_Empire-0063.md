> The Seleucid Empire (sih-LEW-sid) was a Greek state in West Asia during the Hellenistic period. 
> 
> It was founded in 312 BC by the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator, 
> following the division of the Macedonian Empire founded by Alexander the Great, 
> and ruled by the Seleucid dynasty 
> until its annexation by the Roman Republic under Pompey in 63 BC.
>
> After receiving the Mesopotamian regions of Babylonia and Assyria in 321 BC, 
> Seleucus I began expanding his dominions to include the Near Eastern territories 
> that encompass modern-day Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lebanon, 
> all of which had been under Macedonian control after the fall of the former Achaemenid Empire. 
> 
> At the Seleucid Empire's height, it had consisted of territory that covered 
> Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, 
> and what are now modern Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Turkmenistan.
>
> The Seleucid Empire was a major center of Hellenistic culture. 
> Greek customs and language were privileged; 
> the wide variety of local traditions had been generally tolerated, 
> while an urban Greek elite had formed the dominant political class 
> and was reinforced by steady immigration from Greece. 
> 
> The empire's western territories were repeatedly contested with Ptolemaic Egypt—
> a rival Hellenistic state. 
> 
> To the east, conflict with the Indian ruler Chandragupta of the Maurya Empire in 305 BC 
> led to the cession of vast territory west of the Indus and a political alliance.
>
> In the early second century BC, Antiochus III the Great 
> attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece, 
> but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and its Greek allies. 
> 
> The Seleucids were forced to pay costly war reparations 
> and had to relinquish territorial claims west of the Taurus Mountains in southern Anatolia, 
> marking the gradual decline of their empire. 
> 
> Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern lands of the Seleucid Empire 
> in the mid-second century BC, including Assyria and what had been Babylonia, 
> while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast. 
> 
> The Seleucid kings were thereafter reduced to a rump state in Syria after a civil war, 
> until their conquest by Tigranes the Great of Armenia in 83 BC, 
> and ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BC.
