> The Pannonian Avars ( AV-arz) were 
> an alliance of several groups of Eurasian nomads of various origins. 
> The peoples were also known as the Obri (modern Russian: обры, Obry) 
> in the chronicles of the Rus,
> the Abaroi or Varchonitai (Greek: Βαρχονῖται, romanized: Varchonitai), 
> or Pseudo-Avars in Byzantine sources, and the Apar (Old Turkic: 𐰯𐰺) to the Göktürks. 
> 
> They established the Avar Khaganate, which spanned the Pannonian Basin 
> and considerable areas of Central and Eastern Europe from the late-6th to the early-9th centuries.
>
> The name "Pannonian Avars" 
> (after  Pannonia in the upper Danube basin where they eventually settled) 
> is used to distinguish them from the Avars of the Caucasus, 
> a separate people with whom the Pannonian Avars may or may not have had links. 
> 
> Although the name Avar first appeared in the mid-5th century, 
> the Pannonian Avars entered the historical scene in the mid-6th century, 
> on the Pontic–Caspian steppe as a people who wished to escape the rule of the Göktürks. 
> 
> They are probably best known for their invasions and destruction in the Avar–Byzantine wars 
> from 568 to 626 and for their influence on the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe.
>
> Recent archaeogenetic studies indicate that the Pannonian Avars were of primarily Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry similar to the forebears of modern-day people from Mongolia and the Amur River region in Manchuria, pointing to an initial rapid migration of nomadic tribes into the centre of Europe from the Eastern Eurasian Steppe. The Pannonian Avars' core may have been descended from the remnants of the Rouran Khaganate, which were accompanied by other Eurasian steppe groups.
