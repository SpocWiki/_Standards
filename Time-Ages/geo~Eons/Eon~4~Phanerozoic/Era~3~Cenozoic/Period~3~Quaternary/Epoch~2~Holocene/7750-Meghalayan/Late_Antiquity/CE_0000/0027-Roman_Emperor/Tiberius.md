> **Tiberius** Julius Caesar Augustus (ty-BEER-ee-əs; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March AD 37) 
> was Roman emperor from AD 14 until 37. 
> 
> He succeeded his stepfather [[Augustus|Augustus]], the first Roman emperor. 
> Tiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC to Roman politician 
> Tiberius Claudius Nero and his wife, Livia Drusilla. 
> 
> In 38 BC, Tiberius's mother divorced his father and married Augustus. 
> Following the untimely deaths of Augustus's two grandsons and adopted heirs, 
> Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus's successor. 
> 
> Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat 
> and one of the most successful Roman generals. 
> His conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania 
> laid the foundations for the empire's northern frontier.
>
> Early in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus's friend, 
> distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. 
> They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. 
> 
> After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania 
> and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' own daughter (Tiberius's step-sister) Julia. 
> Tiberius reluctantly gave in. 
> 
> This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; 
> ultimately, Julia was sent into exile by her father. 
> Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. 
> 
> On Augustus's death in 14, Tiberius became princeps at the age of 55. 
> He seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance 
> and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, 
> compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus.
>
> From the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with the Senate 
> and suspected many plots against him. 
> 
> Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. 
> After the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in AD 19 and his son Drusus in 23, 
> Tiberius became reclusive and aloof. 
> 
> In 26 he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely 
> in the hands of his ambitious praetorian prefect Sejanus, 
> whom he later had executed for treason, and then Sejanus's replacement, Macro. 
> 
> When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, 
> Germanicus's son Caligula, whose lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours 
> drained much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers 
> through good management.
>
> Tiberius allowed the worship of his divine Genius in only one temple, in Rome's eastern provinces, 
> and promoted restraint in the empire-wide cult to the deceased Augustus. 
> 
> When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. 
> He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; 
> Pliny the Elder called him "the gloomiest of men".
