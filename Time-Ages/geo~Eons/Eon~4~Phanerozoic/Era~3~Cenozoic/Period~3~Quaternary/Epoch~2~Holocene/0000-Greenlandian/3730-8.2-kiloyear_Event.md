The **8.2-kiloyear event** refers to a **significant and abrupt global cooling episode** 
that occurred approximately **8,200 years before present (BP)**, i.e., around **6237 BCE** (3730-3854 HE). 
This event lasted for an estimated **160 to 400 years**, depending on the region and proxy used 

The **8.2-kiloyear event** was one of the most abrupt climatic changes in the Holocene. 
It serves as a vital analog for understanding the sensitivity of Earth's climate system 
to freshwater forcing and ocean circulation changes. 
The event had profound ecological and societal consequences 
and is central to stratigraphic definitions of Holocene subdivisions like the **Northgrippian Age**.
