The **8.2-kiloyear event** refers to a **significant and abrupt global cooling episode** 
that occurred approximately **8,200 years before present (BP)**, i.e., around **6237 BCE** (3730-3854 HE). 
This event lasted for an estimated **160 to 400 years**, depending on the region and proxy used 

The **8.2-kiloyear event** was one of the most abrupt climatic changes in the Holocene. 
It serves as a vital analog for understanding the sensitivity of Earth's climate system 
to freshwater forcing and ocean circulation changes. 
The event had profound ecological and societal consequences 
and is central to stratigraphic definitions of Holocene subdivisions like the **Northgrippian Age**.

> In climatology, the 8.2 kiloyear event was a rapid drop in global temperatures 
> that occurred around 8,200 years ago, lasting between two and four centuries. 
> 
> This event marks the beginning of the Northgrippian Age within the Holocene epoch. 
> While this cooling phase was not as intense as the earlier Younger Dryas period 
> that occurred just before the Holocene began, it was still significant. 
> 
> During the 8.2-kiloyear event, atmospheric methane levels dropped by 80 parts per billion, 
> a 15% reduction, suggesting a broad cooling and drying trend across the Northern Hemisphere.
