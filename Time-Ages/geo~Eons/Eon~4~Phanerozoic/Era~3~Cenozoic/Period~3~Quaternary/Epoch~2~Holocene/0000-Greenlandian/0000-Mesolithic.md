> The **Mesolithic** (Greek: μέσος, mesos 'middle' + λίθος, lithos 'stone') 
> or Middle Stone Age is the Old World archaeological period 
> between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neolithic. 
> 
> The term Epipaleolithic is often used synonymously, 
> especially for areas outside northern Europe, 
> and for the corresponding period in the Levant and Caucasus. 
> 
> The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia. 
> It refers to the final period of hunter-gatherer cultures in Europe and Middle East, 
> between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Neolithic Revolution. 
> 
> In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BP; 
> in the Middle East (the Epipalaeolithic Near East) roughly 20,000 to 10,000 BP. 
> The term is less used of areas farther east, 
> and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.
>
> The type of culture associated with the Mesolithic varies between areas, 
> but it is associated with a decline in the group hunting of large animals 
> in favour of a broader __hunter-gatherer__ way of life, 
> and the development of more sophisticated and smaller lithic tools and weapons 
> than the heavy-chipped equivalents typical of the Paleolithic.  
> 
> Depending on the region, some use of pottery and textiles 
> may be found in sites allocated to the Mesolithic, 
> but generally indications of agriculture are taken 
> as marking transition into the Neolithic.  
> 
> The more permanent settlements tend to be close to the sea or inland waters 
> offering a good supply of food. 
> 
> Mesolithic societies are not seen as very complex, and burials are fairly simple; 
> in contrast, grandiose burial mounds are a mark of the [[2000-Neolithic]].
