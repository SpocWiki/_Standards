> **Göbekli Tepe** (Turkish: [ɟœbecˈli teˈpe], 'Potbelly Hill'; Kurdish: Girê Mirazan or Xerabreşkê, 'Wish Hill') 
> is a Neolithic archaeological site in Upper Mesopotamia (al-Jazira) in modern-day Turkey. 
> The settlement was inhabited from around 9500 BCE to at least 8000 BCE, 
> during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. 
> 
> It is famous for its large circular structures that contain massive stone pillars – 
> among the world's oldest known megaliths. 
> Many of these pillars are decorated with anthropomorphic details, clothing, 
> and sculptural reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion 
> and the particular iconography of the period. 
> The 15 m (50 ft) high, 8 ha (20-acre) tell is densely covered with ancient domestic structures 
> and other small buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, 
> as well as some traces of activity from later periods.
>
> The site was first used at the dawn of the southwest Asian Neolithic period, 
> which marked the appearance of the oldest permanent human settlements anywhere in the world. 
> Prehistorians link this Neolithic Revolution to the advent of agriculture 
> but disagree on whether farming caused people to settle down or vice versa. 
> Göbekli Tepe, a monumental complex built on a rocky mountaintop 
> with no clear evidence of agricultural cultivation, has played a prominent role in this debate.
>
> Recent findings suggest a settlement at Göbekli Tepe, with domestic structures, 
> extensive cereal processing, a water supply, and tools associated with daily life. 
> This contrasts with a previous interpretation of the site as a sanctuary used by nomads, 
> with few or no permanent inhabitants. 
> No definitive purpose has been determined for the megalithic structures, 
> which have been popularly described as the "world's first temple[s]". 
> They were likely roofed and appear to have regularly collapsed, been inundated by slope slides, 
> and subsequently repaired or rebuilt. 
> The architecture and iconography are similar to other contemporary sites in the vicinity, 
> such as Karahan Tepe.
>
> The site was first noted in a 1963 archaeological survey. 
> German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt recognised its significance in 1994 
> and began excavations there the following year. 
> After he died in 2014, work continued as a joint project of Istanbul University, Şanlıurfa Museum, 
> and the German Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Turkish prehistorian Necmi Karul. 
> Göbekli Tepe was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018, recognising its 
> outstanding universal value as "one of the first manifestations of human-made monumental architecture". 
> As of 2021, around 10% of the site has been excavated. 
> Additional areas were examined by geophysical surveys, 
> which showed the mound to contain at least 20 large enclosures.
