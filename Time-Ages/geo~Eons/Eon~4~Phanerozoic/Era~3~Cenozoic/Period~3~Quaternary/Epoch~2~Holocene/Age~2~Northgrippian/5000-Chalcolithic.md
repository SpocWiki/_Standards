## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Chalcolithic** ( KAL-kə-LI-thik) (also called the Copper Age and Eneolithic) 
> was an archaeological period characterized by the increasing use of smelted copper. 
> It followed the Neolithic and preceded the Bronze Age. 
> 
> It occurred at different periods in different areas, but was absent in some  parts of the world, 
> such as Russia, where there was no well-defined Copper Age between the Stone and Bronze Ages. 
> Stone tools were still predominantly used during this period.
>
> The Chalcolithic covers both the early cold working (hammering) of near pure copper ores, 
> as exhibited by the likes of North American Great Lakes Old Copper complex, 
> from around 6,500 BC, through the later copper smelting cultures. 
> 
> The archaeological site of Belovode, on Rudnik mountain in Serbia, 
> has the world's oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting at high temperature, 
> from c. 5,000 BC. 
> 
> The transition from Copper Age to Bronze Age in Europe 
> occurred between the late 5th and the late 3rd millennium BC. 
> In the Ancient Near East the Copper Age covered about the same period, 
> beginning in the late 5th millennium BC 
> and lasting for about a millennium before it gave rise to the Early Bronze Age.
>
> A study in the journal Antiquity from 2013 reporting the discovery of 
> a tin bronze foil from the Pločnik archaeological site dated to c. 4,650 BC, as well as 
> 14 other artefacts from Bulgaria and Serbia dated to before 4,000 BC, 
> showed that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought 
> and developed independently in Europe 
> 1,500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the Near East. 
> 
> In Britain, the Chalcolithic is a short period between about 2,500 and 2,200 BC, 
> characterized by the first appearance of objects of copper and gold, a new ceramic culture 
> and the immigration of [[Beaker culture]] people, heralding the end of the local late Neolithic.
