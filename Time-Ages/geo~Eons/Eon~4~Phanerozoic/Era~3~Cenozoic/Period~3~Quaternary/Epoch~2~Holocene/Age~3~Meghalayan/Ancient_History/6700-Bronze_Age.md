> The **Bronze Age** (c. 3300 – c. 1200 BC) was a historical period characterised principally by the 
> use of __bronze tools__ and the development of complex __urban societies__, 
> as well as the adoption of __writing__ in some areas. 
> 
> The Bronze Age is the middle principal period of the three-age system, 
> following the Stone Age and preceding the Iron Age. 
> 
> Conceived as a global era, the Bronze Age follows the Neolithic, 
> with a transition period between the two known as the Chalcolithic. 
> The final decades of the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean basin are 
> often characterised as a period of widespread societal collapse 
> known as the Late Bronze Age collapse (c. 1200 – c. 1150 BC), 
> although its severity and scope are debated among scholars.
>
> An ancient civilisation is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age if it either 
> - produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, 
> - or traded other items for bronze from producing areas elsewhere. 
> 
> Bronze Age cultures were the first to develop writing. 
> According to archaeological evidence, cultures 
> - in Mesopotamia, which used cuneiform script, 
> - and Egypt, which used hieroglyphs, developed the earliest practical writing systems.  
> 
> In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead, 
> which does not include a Bronze Age, though some cultures there did smelt copper and bronze. 
> Indigenous metalworking arrived in Australia with European contact.
>
> In many areas bronze continued to be rare and expensive, 
> mainly because of difficulties in obtaining enough tin, which occurs in relatively few places, 
> unlike the very common copper.  
> 
> Some societies appear to have gone through much of the Bronze Age 
> using bronze only for weapons or elite art, such as Chinese ritual bronzes, 
> with ordinary farmers largely still using stone tools.  
> 
> However, this is hard to assess as the rarity of bronze meant it was __keenly recycled__.
