## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Ancient Egypt** was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. 
> It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, 
> situated within the contemporary territory of modern-day Egypt. 
> 
> Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt 
> and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) 
> with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under pharaoh or king Menes 
> (often identified with Narmer). 
> 
> The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms 
> interspersed by periods of relative instability known as "Intermediate Periods". 
> The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories: 
> - the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, 
> - the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, or 
> - the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.
>
> Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, 
> ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. 
> 
> After this period, it entered an era of slow decline. 
> Ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including 
> - the Hyksos, 
> - the Kushites, 
> - the Assyrians, 
> - the Achaemenid Persians, and 
> - the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. 
> 
> The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom, formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death, ruled until 30 BC, 
> when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province. 
> Egypt remained under Roman control until 642 AD, 
> when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate.
>
> The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to 
> adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. 
> 
> The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, 
> which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. 
> 
> With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley 
> and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, 
> the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, 
> trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance. 
> 
> Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, 
> and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, 
> who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people 
> in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs.
>
> The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying, 
> and construction techniques that supported the building of pyramids, temples, and obelisks; 
> a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems, 
> and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, 
> Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, 
> and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. 
> 
> Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, 
> and its antiquities were carried off to be studied, admired 
> or coveted in the far corners of the world. 
> 
> Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia. 
> A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans 
> and Egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization 
> and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.
