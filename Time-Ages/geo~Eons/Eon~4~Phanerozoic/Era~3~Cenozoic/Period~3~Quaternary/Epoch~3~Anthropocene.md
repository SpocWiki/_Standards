> **Anthropocene** is a term that has been used to refer to the period of time 
> during which humanity has become a planetary force of change. 
> It appears in scientific and social discourse, 
> especially with respect to accelerating geophysical and biochemical changes 
> that characterize the 20th and 21st centuries on Earth. 
> 
> Originally a proposal for a new geological epoch following the Holocene, 
> it was rejected as such in 2024 by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) 
> and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).
>
> The term has been used in research relating to Earth's water, 
> geology, geomorphology, landscape, limnology, hydrology, ecosystems and climate. 
> 
> The effects of human activities on Earth can be seen for example in biodiversity loss and climate change. 
> 
> Various start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, 
> ranging from the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution (12,000–15,000 years ago), 
> to as recently as the 1960s. 
> The biologist Eugene F. Stoermer is credited with first coining 
> and using the term anthropocene informally in the 1980s; 
> Paul J. Crutzen re-invented and popularized the term.
>
> The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the ICS 
> voted in April 2016 to proceed towards a formal golden spike (GSSP) proposal 
> to define an Anthropocene epoch in the geologic time scale. 
> The group presented the proposal to the International Geological Congress in August 2016.
>
> In May 2019, the AWG voted in favour of submitting a formal proposal to the ICS by 2021. 
> The proposal located potential stratigraphic markers to the mid-20th century. 
> This time period coincides with the start of the Great Acceleration, 
> a post-World War II time period during which global population growth, pollution 
> and exploitation of natural resources have all increased at a dramatic rate. 
> The Atomic Age also started around the mid-20th century, 
> when the risks of nuclear wars, nuclear terrorism and nuclear accidents increased.
>
> Twelve candidate sites were selected for the GSSP; 
> the sediments of Crawford Lake, Canada were finally proposed, in July 2023, 
> to mark the lower boundary of the Anthropocene, starting with the Crawfordian stage/age in 1950.
>
> In March 2024, after 15 years of deliberation, the Anthropocene Epoch proposal of the AWG was voted down by a wide margin 
> by the SQS, owing largely to its shallow sedimentary record and extremely recent proposed start date. 
> The ICS and the IUGS later formally confirmed, by a near unanimous vote, 
> the rejection of the AWG's Anthropocene Epoch proposal for inclusion in the Geologic Time Scale. 
> 
> The IUGS statement on the rejection concluded: "Despite its rejection as a formal unit of the Geologic Time Scale, 
> Anthropocene will nevertheless continue to be used not only by Earth and environmental scientists, 
> but also by social scientists, politicians and economists, as well as by the public at large. 
> It will remain an invaluable descriptor of human impact on the Earth system."

## Indicators 

Proponents argue that evidence for the Anthropocene includes:
- **Climate Change**: Accelerated climate change attributed to human activities, primarily the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the [[Epoch~3~Anthropocene/Modern_History/Industrial_Revolution|Industrial Revolution]].
- **Biodiversity Loss**: Increased rates of species extinctions and biodiversity loss linked to habitat destruction, pollution, and other anthropogenic factors.
- **Sediment Changes**: Changes in sedimentation patterns due to urbanization, agriculture, and industrial processes.
- **Chemical Signatures**: The presence of new materials like plastics, concrete, and nuclear fallout in the geologic record, which may serve as markers for the Anthropocene.
    

## Date of Onset

The onset of the Anthropocene epoch is still debated. Proposed starting points include:
- Neolithic Revolution (12,000–15,000 years ago): 
- the [[Epoch~2~Holocene|Holocene Calendar]] or  Human Era as proposed by Cesare Emiliani 
- **[[Epoch~3~Anthropocene/Modern_History/Industrial_Revolution|Industrial Revolution]] (~1750 CE)**: Marking the significant rise in coal use and greenhouse gas emissions.
- **The Great Acceleration (~1950 CE)**: Highlighting the exponential growth in population, industrialization, and environmental impacts.
