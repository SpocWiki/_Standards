# [[Period~2~Cryogenian]] 

#is_a_/time_/Period 

A time period from 720 to 635 million years ago. 

> The **Cryogenian** (from Ancient Greek: κρύος, romanized: krýos, meaning "cold" and γένεσις, romanized: génesis, meaning "birth") is a geologic period that lasted from 720 to 635 million years ago. 
> It forms the second geologic period of the Neoproterozoic Era, preceded by the [[Period~1~Tonian]] and followed by the [[Period~3~Ediacaran]].
>
> The Cryogenian was a time of drastic biosphere changes. 
> After the previous Boring Billion years of stability, at the beginning of Cryogenian the severe Sturtian glaciation began, freezing the entire Earth in a planetary state known as a Snowball Earth. 
> After 70 million years it ended, but was quickly followed by the Marinoan glaciation, which was also a global event. 
> These events are the subject of much scientific controversy specifically over whether these glaciations covered the entire planet or a band of open sea survived near the equator (termed "slushball Earth").
