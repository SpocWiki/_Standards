## Overview of orbital variations affecting Earth’s climate

Earth’s orbital parameters vary through well-quantified gravitational interactions 
primarily with Jupiter and Saturn, 
producing cyclic changes known collectively as Milanković cycles, 
which modulate incoming solar radiation by measurable amounts in kyr timescales.

## Eccentricity changes

### Physical mechanism

Eccentricity varies because gravitational perturbations from Jupiter with a mass of 1.90 × 10²⁷ kg and Saturn with a mass of 5.68 × 10²⁶ kg exchange angular momentum with Earth’s orbit, slowly deforming it from near-circular to mildly elliptical.

### Quantitative characteristics

| Parameter                        | Minimum | Maximum | Unit          |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Orbital eccentricity             | 0.003   | 0.058   | dimensionless |
| Dominant cycle length            | 100 000 | 413 000 | yr            |
| Change in mean annual insolation | 0.1     | 0.2     | W·m⁻²         |

Eccentricity modifies the Earth–Sun distance from 0.983 AU to 1.017 AU at present, producing approximately 6.8 % seasonal variation in received solar energy between perihelion and aphelion.

## Axial tilt (obliquity) changes

### Physical mechanism

Axial tilt varies because torques exerted by the Moon with a mass of 7.35 × 10²² kg and the Sun on Earth’s equatorial bulge alter the orientation of Earth’s rotation axis relative to the ecliptic plane.

### Quantitative characteristics

| Parameter             | Minimum | Maximum | Unit   |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Axial tilt            | 22.1    | 24.5    | degree |
| Mean value            | 23.44   | 23.44   | degree |
| Dominant cycle length | 41 000  | 41 000  | yr     |

An increase of 1.0 ° in tilt raises summer insolation at 65 ° N latitude by approximately 25 W·m⁻², corresponding to about 6 % of peak summer solar input, significantly affecting ice-sheet stability.

## Axial precession changes

### Physical mechanism

Precession arises from gravitational torques from the Sun and Moon causing Earth’s spin axis to trace a conical motion, while apsidal precession alters the orientation of Earth’s orbital ellipse, together shifting the timing of perihelion relative to the seasons.

### Quantitative characteristics

| Parameter                          | Value         | Unit |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| Axial precession period            | 25 700        | yr   |
| Apsidal precession period          | 112 000       | yr   |
| Combined climatic precession cycle | 19 000–23 000 | yr   |

Precession changes seasonal insolation by up to 10 % at mid- to high latitudes without altering the annual global mean of approximately 340 W·m⁻².

## Interactions and combined effects

### Insolation redistribution

When eccentricity is high and precession aligns perihelion with Northern Hemisphere summer, 
summer insolation at 65 ° N can increase by approximately 60 W·m⁻², 
or about 15 %, relative to low-eccentricity configurations.

## Scientific interpretations and authority weighting

### Mainstream consensus

Approximately 90 % of peer-reviewed paleoclimate literature 
attributes Quaternary glacial–interglacial timing primarily to orbital forcing 
amplified by ice-albedo and greenhouse gas feedbacks, 
with high authority from sources such as NASA and IPCC assessments.
