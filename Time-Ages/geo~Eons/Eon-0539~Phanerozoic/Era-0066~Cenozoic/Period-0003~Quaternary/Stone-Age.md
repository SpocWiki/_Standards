## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Stone Age** was a broad prehistoric period during which 
> stone was widely used to make stone tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. 
> 
> The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years and ended between 4000 BC and 2000 BC, 
> with the __advent of metalworking__. It therefore represents nearly 99.3% of human history
> and sits mostly in the [[../Period-0003~Quaternary|Period~3~Quaternary]]. 
>
> Though some simple metalworking of malleable metals was known in the Stone Age, 
> particularly the use of gold and copper for purposes of ornamentation, 
> it is the melting and smelting of copper that marks the end of the Stone Age. 
> 
> In Western Asia, this occurred by about 3000 BC, when bronze became widespread. 
> The term Bronze Age is used to describe the period that followed the Stone Age, 
> as well as to describe cultures that had developed techniques and technologies 
> for working copper alloys (bronze: originally copper and arsenic, later copper and tin) 
> into tools, supplanting stone in many uses.
>
> Stone Age artifacts that have been discovered include tools used by modern humans, 
> by their predecessor species in the genus Homo, 
> and possibly by the earlier partly contemporaneous genera Australopithecus and Paranthropus. 
> Bone tools have been discovered that were used during this period as well 
> but these are rarely preserved in the archaeological record. 
> The Stone Age is further subdivided by the types of stone tools in use.
>
> The Stone Age is the first period in the three-age system frequently used in archaeology 
> to divide the timeline of human technological prehistory (especially in Europe and western Asia) 
> into functional periods, with the next two being the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, respectively.  
> 
> The Stone Age is also commonly divided into three distinct periods: 
> - the earliest and most primitive being the Paleolithic era; 
> - a transitional period with finer tools known as the Mesolithic era; 
> - and the final stage known as the Neolithic era. 
> 
> Neolithic peoples were the first to transition away from hunter-gatherer societies 
> into the settled lifestyle of inhabiting towns and villages as agriculture became widespread. 
> In the chronology of prehistory, 
> the Neolithic era usually overlaps with the Chalcolithic ("Copper") era preceding the Bronze Age.
>
> The Archaeology of the Americas uses different markers to assign five periods 
> which have different dates in different areas; the oldest period is the similarly named Lithic stage.
