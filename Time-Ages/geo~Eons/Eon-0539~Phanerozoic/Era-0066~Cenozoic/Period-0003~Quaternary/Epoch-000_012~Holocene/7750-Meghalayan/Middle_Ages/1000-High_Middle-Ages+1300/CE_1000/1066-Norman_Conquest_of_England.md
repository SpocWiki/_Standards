## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Norman Conquest of England (or the Conquest) was an 11th-century invasion 
> by an army made up of thousands of Norman, French, Flemish, and Breton troops, 
> all led by the Duke of Normandy, later styled William the Conqueror.
>
> William's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship 
> with the childless Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor, 
> who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. 
> 
> Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. 
> The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 
> and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September, 
> but Godwinson's army defeated and killed Hardrada 
> at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. 
> 
> Three days later on 28 September, William's invasion force of thousands of men 
> and hundreds of ships landed at Pevensey in Sussex in southern England. 
> 
> Harold marched south to oppose him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. 
> Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings. 
> William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement, and William became king.
>
> Although William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years 
> and was not secure on the English throne until after 1072. 
> 
> The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. 
> To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers 
> and built castles commanding military strong points throughout the land. 
> 
> The Domesday Book, a manuscript record of the "Great Survey" 
> of much of England and parts of Wales, was completed by 1086. 
> 
> Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, 
> the introduction of a dialect of French as the language of the elites, 
> and changes in the composition of the upper classes, 
> as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. 
> 
> More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: 
> the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, 
> which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. 
> 
> There was little alteration in the structure of government, 
> as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government.
