## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Early Middle Ages** (or early medieval period), 
> sometimes controversially referred to as the Dark Ages, 
> is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th to the 10th century. 
> 
> They marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history, 
> following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, 
> and preceding the High Middle Ages (c. 11th to 14th centuries). 
> 
> The alternative term late antiquity, for the early part of the period, 
> emphasizes elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, 
> while early Middle Ages is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period. 
> The time between the 8th and 11th centuries (c. 800–1000) 
> is assigned to the early Middle Ages generally, 
> even by those who extend (late) antiquity to a time well after the 5th century.
>
> The period saw a continuation of trends evident since late classical antiquity, 
> including population decline, especially in urban centres, a decline of trade, 
> a small rise in average temperatures in the North Atlantic region and increased migration. 
> 
> In the 19th century the early Middle Ages were often labelled the Dark Ages, 
> a characterization based on the relative scarcity of literary and cultural output from this time. 
> The term is rarely used by academics today. 
> 
> The Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, survived, 
> though in the 7th century the Rashidun Caliphate 
> and the Umayyad Caliphate conquered the southern part of the Roman territory.
>
> Many of the listed trends reversed later in the period. 
> In 800, the title of Emperor was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne, 
> whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history. 
> 
> Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system, 
> which adopted such innovations as three-field planting and the heavy plough. 
> Barbarian migration stabilized in much of Europe, 
> although the Viking expansion greatly affected Northern Europe.
