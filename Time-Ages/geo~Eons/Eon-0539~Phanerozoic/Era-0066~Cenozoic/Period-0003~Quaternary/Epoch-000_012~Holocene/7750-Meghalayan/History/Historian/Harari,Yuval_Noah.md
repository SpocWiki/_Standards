> Yuval Noah Harari (Hebrew: יובל נח הררי [juˈval ˈnoaχ haˈʁaʁi]; born 1976) 
> is an Israeli author, public intellectual, historian 
> and professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
> 
> He is the author of the popular science bestsellers 
> - Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2014), 
> - Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2016), and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (2018). 
> - Nexus (2025) 
> His writings examine free will, consciousness, intelligence, happiness, and suffering.
>
> Harari writes about a "cognitive revolution" 
> that supposedly occurred roughly 70,000 years ago 
> when Homo sapiens supplanted the rival Neanderthals and other species of the genus Homo, developed language skills and structured societies, and ascended as apex predators, 
> aided by the agricultural revolution and accelerated by the scientific revolution, 
> which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment. 
> 
> His books also examine the possible consequences of a futuristic biotechnological world in which intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations; he has said, "Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so".
> In Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Harari surveys human history from the evolutionary emergence of Homo sapiens to 21st-century political and technological revolutions. The book is based on his lectures to an undergraduate world history class, although 
> outside of popular discourse his work has been met with a generally negative or mixed scholarly reception.
