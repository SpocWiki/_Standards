> **Xenophon** of Athens (Ancient Greek: Ξενοφῶν; c. 430 – 355/354 BC) 
> was a Greek military leader, philosopher, and historian. 
> 
> At the age of 30, he was elected as one of the leaders of the retreating Greek mercenaries, 
> the Ten Thousand, who had been part of Cyrus the Younger's 
> attempt to seize control of the Achaemenid Empire. 
> 
> As the military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge wrote, 
> "the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior".
>
> For at least two millennia, it has been debated 
> whether Xenophon was first and foremost a general, historian, or philosopher. 
> 
> For the majority of time in the past two millennia, 
> Xenophon was recognized as a philosopher. 
> 
> Quintilian in The Orator's Education discusses the most prominent historians, orators 
> and philosophers as examples of eloquence and recognizes Xenophon's historical work, 
> but ultimately places Xenophon next to Plato as a philosopher. 
> 
> Today, Xenophon is recognized as one of the greatest writers of antiquity. 
> Xenophon's works span multiple genres and are written in plain Attic Greek, 
> which is why they have often been used in translation exercises 
> for contemporary students of the Ancient Greek language. 
> 
> In the Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, Diogenes Laërtius observed 
> that Xenophon was known as the "Attic Muse" because of the sweetness of his diction.
>
> Despite being born an Athenian citizen, 
> Xenophon came to be associated with Sparta, the traditional opponent of Athens. 
> 
> Much of what is known today about the Spartan society 
> comes from Xenophon's royal biography of the Spartan king Agesilaus 
> and the Constitution of the Lacedaemonians. 
> 
> The sub-satrap Mania is primarily known through Xenophon's writings. 
> Xenophon's Anabasis recounts his adventures with the Ten Thousand 
> while in the service of Cyrus the Younger, 
> Cyrus's failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from Artaxerxes II of Persia, 
> and the return of Greek mercenaries after Cyrus's death in the Battle of Cunaxa.
>
> Xenophon wrote Cyropaedia, 
> outlining both military and political methods used by Cyrus the Great 
> to conquer the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. 
> 
> Anabasis and Cyropaedia inspired Alexander the Great and other Greeks 
> to conquer Babylon and the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC. 
> 
> The Hellenica continues directly from the final sentence of 
> Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War 
> covering the last seven years of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) 
> and the subsequent forty-two years (404–362 BC) 
> ending with the Second Battle of Mantinea. 
> 
> Xenophon's writings on military strategies remain influential 
> and is believed to be one of the first 
> to utilize and describe flanking maneuvers and feints in military tactics.
