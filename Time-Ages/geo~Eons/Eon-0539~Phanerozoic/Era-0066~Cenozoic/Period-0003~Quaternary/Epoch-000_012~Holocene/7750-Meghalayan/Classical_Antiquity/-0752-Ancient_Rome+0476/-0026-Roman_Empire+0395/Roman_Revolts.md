## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> This list of Roman civil wars and revolts includes civil wars and organized civil disorder, 
> revolts, and rebellions in ancient Rome (Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic, and Roman Empire) 
> until the fall of the Western Roman Empire (753 BC – AD 476). 
> 
> For the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire 
> after the division of the Empire in West and East, 
> see [[Byzantine revolts and civil wars]] (AD 330–1453). 
> For external conflicts, see List of Roman external wars and battles. 
>
> From the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the 1st century BC, 
> there were a sparse number of civil wars. 
> 
> But with the Crisis of the Roman Republic (134–44 BC), 
> a period of considerable political instability began. 
> 
> The cause of the late Roman Republican civil wars is contested, 
> as is whether the wars were the cause of, or caused by, the end of the Roman Republic. 
> 
> Regardless, a nearly constant stream of civil wars marked the end of the Roman Republic 
> and heralded the rise of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. 
> 
> The first century of Empire was marked by widespread revolt 
> through territory Rome had captured in the preceding centuries. 
> 
> The second century AD was relatively peaceful, with a limited number of revolts. 
> Political instability returned to the Empire with the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD), 
> which saw at least 26 civil wars in just 50 years as usurpers sought the imperial throne. 
> 
> The fourth and fifth centuries AD were characterized by a regular rising of usurpers. 
> The overthrow of the last Western Roman emperor in AD 476 by the Germanic king Odoacer 
> marked the final civil war or revolt, as well as the end of the Western Roman Empire. 
>
> Because the study of Roman civil war 
> has been deeply influenced by historic Roman views on civil war, 
> not all entries on this list may be considered civil wars by modern historians. 
> 
> Implicit in most Roman power struggles was a propaganda battle, 
> which impacted how the struggle would be chronicled and referred to. 
> 
> For example, historians Lange & Vervaet suggest that the crisis after Caesar's assassination 
> might be better understood as an internal emergency. 
> 
> Conversely, some revolts on this list may be properly considered to be civil wars, 
> but were not referred to as such by Roman chroniclers. 
> 
> As Lange & Vervaet note, "civil war often refuses to speak its name."
