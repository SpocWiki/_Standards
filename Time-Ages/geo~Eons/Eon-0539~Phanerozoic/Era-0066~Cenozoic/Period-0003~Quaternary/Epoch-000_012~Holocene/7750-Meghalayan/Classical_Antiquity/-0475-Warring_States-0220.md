## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Warring States period in Chinese history (c. 475 – 221 BC) 
> comprises the final centuries of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 – 256 BC), 
> which were characterized by warfare, bureaucratic and military reform, and political consolidation. 
> 
> It followed the Spring and Autumn period and concluded with the wars of conquest 
> that saw the state of Qin annex each of the other contender states by 221 BC 
> and found the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynastic state in East Asian history.
>
> While scholars have identified several different dates as 
> marking the beginning of the Warring States period, 
> Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is the most often cited. 
> 
> The era largely corresponds to the second half of the Eastern Zhou period, 
> when the king of Zhou formally ruled as Chinese sovereign, 
> but had lost political power and functioned in practice as a figurehead. 
> 
> This dynamic served as the backdrop for the machinations of the eponymous Warring States. 
> The label "Warring States period" derives from the Record of the Warring States, 
> a work of history compiled during the early Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).
