> The Zhou dynasty ( JOH; Chinese: 周; pinyin: Zhōu, pronunciation: [ʈʂóʊ]) 
> was a royal dynasty of China that existed for 789 years from c. 1046 BC until 256 BC, 
> the longest span of any dynasty in Chinese history. 
> 
> During the Western Zhou period (c. 1046 – 771 BC), the royal house, surnamed Ji, 
> had military control over territories centered on the Wei River valley and North China Plain. 
> 
> Even as Zhou suzerainty became increasingly ceremonial 
> over the following Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BC), 
> the political system created by the Zhou royal house survived in some form 
> for several additional centuries. 
> 
> A date of 1046 BC for the Zhou's establishment 
> is supported by the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project and David Pankenier, 
> but David Nivison and Edward L. Shaughnessy date the establishment to 1045 BC.
>
> The latter Eastern Zhou period is itself roughly subdivided into two parts. 
> During the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771 – c. 481 BC), 
> power became increasingly decentralized 
> as the authority of the royal house diminished. 
> 
> The Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BC) that followed 
> saw large-scale warfare and consolidation 
> among what had formerly been Zhou client states, 
> until the Zhou were formally extinguished by the state of Qin in 256 BC. 
> 
> The Qin ultimately founded the imperial Qin dynasty in 221 BC 
> after conquering all of China.
>
> The Zhou period is often considered to be the zenith for the craft of Chinese bronzeware. The latter Zhou period is also famous for the advent of three major Chinese philosophies: Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism. The Zhou dynasty also spans the period when the predominant form of written Chinese became seal script, which evolved from the earlier oracle bone and bronze scripts. By the dynasty's end, an immature form of clerical script had also emerged.
