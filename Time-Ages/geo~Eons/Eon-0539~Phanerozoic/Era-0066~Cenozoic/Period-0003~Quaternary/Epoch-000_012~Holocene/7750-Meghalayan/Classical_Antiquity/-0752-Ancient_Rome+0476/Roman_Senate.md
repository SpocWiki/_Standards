## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Roman Senate (Latin: Senātus Rōmānus) was the highest 
> and constituting assembly of ancient Rome and its aristocracy. 
> 
> With different powers throughout its existence, 
> it lasted from the first days of the city of Rome (traditionally founded in 753 BC) 
> as the Senate of the Roman Kingdom, to the Senate of the Roman Republic 
> and Senate of the Roman Empire 
> and eventually the Byzantine Senate of the Eastern Roman Empire, 
> existing well into the post-classical era and Middle Ages.  
>
> During the days of the Roman Kingdom, 
> the Senate was generally little more than an advisory council to the king. 
> 
> However, as Rome was an electoral monarchy, 
> the Senate also elected new Roman kings. 
> 
> The last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, 
> was overthrown following a coup d'état led by Lucius Junius Brutus, 
> who founded the Roman Republic. 
> 
> During the early Republic, the Senate was politically weak, 
> while the various executive Roman magistrates who appointed the senators for life 
> (or until expulsion by Roman censors) were quite powerful. 
> 
> Since the transition from monarchy to constitutional rule was most likely gradual, 
> it took several generations before the Senate was able to assert itself 
> over the executive magistrates. 
> 
> By the middle Republic, the Senate had reached the apex of its republican power. 
> The late Republic saw a decline in the Senate's power, 
> which began following the reforms of the tribunes Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus. 
> 
> After the transition of the Republic into the Principate, 
> the Senate lost much of its political power as well as its prestige.  
>
> Following the constitutional reforms of Emperor Diocletian, 
> the Senate became politically irrelevant. 
> 
> When the seat of government was transferred out of Rome, 
> the Senate was reduced to a purely municipal body. 
> 
> That decline in status was reinforced 
> when Constantine the Great created an additional senate in Constantinople. 
> 
> After Romulus Augustulus was deposed in 476, 
> the Senate in the Western Empire functioned under the rule of Odoacer (476–489) 
> and during Ostrogothic rule (489–535). 
> 
> It was restored to its official status after the reconquest of Italy by Justinian I 
> but the Western Senate ultimately disappeared after 603, 
> the date of its last recorded public act. 
> 
> Some Roman aristocrats in the Middle Ages bore the title senator, 
> but it was by this point a purely honorific title 
> and does not reflect the continued existence of the classical Senate.  
>
> The Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople through the 14th century. 
>
> Although the Latin Senatus 
> was the origin of the modern-day concept of the senate in etymological sense, 
> the Roman Senate was not the ancestor or predecessor of parliamentarism 
> and modern senatorial structures in any direct sense, 
> as the Roman senate was not a de jure legislative body.
