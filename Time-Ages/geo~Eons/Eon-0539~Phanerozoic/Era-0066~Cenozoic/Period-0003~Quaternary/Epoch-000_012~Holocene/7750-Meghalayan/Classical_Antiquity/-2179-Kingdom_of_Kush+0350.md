> The **Kingdom of Kush** (Egyptian: 𓎡𓄿𓈙𓈉 kꜣš, Assyrian:  Kûsi, in LXX Χους or Αἰθιοπία; Coptic: ⲉϭⲱϣ Ecōš; Hebrew: כּוּשׁ Kūš), 
> also known as the Kushite Empire, or simply Kush, 
> was an ancient kingdom in Nubia, centered along the Nile Valley 
> in what is now northern Sudan and southern Egypt.
>
> The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization, 
> producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry. 
> 
> The city-state of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between 2450 and 1450 BC, 
> controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts, an area as large as Egypt. 
> The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as "Kush" probably from the indigenous ethnonym "Kasu", 
> over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare, trade, and cultural exchange.
>
> Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period (1550–1070 BC). 
> Following Egypt's disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse, 
> the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata (now modern Karima, Sudan). 
> 
> Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt, such as the veneration of Amun, 
> and the royal families of both kingdoms occasionally intermarried, 
> Kushite culture, language and ethnicity was distinct; 
> Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress, appearance, and even method of transportation.
>
> In the 8th century BC, King Kashta ("the Kushite") peacefully became King of Upper Egypt, 
> while his daughter, Amenirdis, was appointed as Divine Adoratrice of Amun in Thebes. 
> His successor Piye invaded Lower Egypt, establishing the Kushite-ruled Twenty-fifth Dynasty. 
> 
> Piye's daughter, Shepenupet II, was also appointed Divine Adoratrice of Amun. 
> The monarchs of Kush ruled Egypt for over a century until the Assyrian conquest, 
> being dethroned by the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal in the mid-seventh century BC. 
> 
> Following the severing of ties with Egypt, the Kushite imperial capital was located at Meroë, 
> during which time it was known by the Greeks as Aethiopia.
>
> The northernmost part of Nubia was occupied from the third century BC to the third century AD, 
> first by the Ptolemaic Kingdom and then by the Roman Empire. 
> At the end of this 600-year period, the territory, known in the Greco-Roman world as Dodekaschoinos, 
> was taken back by the Kushite king Yesebokheamani. 
> 
> The Kingdom of Kush persisted as a major regional power until the fourth century AD, 
> when it weakened and disintegrated amid worsening climatic conditions, internal rebellions, 
> and foreign invasions— notably by the Noba people, who introduced the Nubian languages 
> and gave their name to Nubia itself. 
> 
> While the Kushites were occupied by war with the Noba and the Blemmyes, 
> the Aksumites took the opportunity to capture Meroë and loot its gold. 
> Negus Ezana then took on the title of "King of Ethiopia," 
> a practice which would last into the modern period 
> and was recorded in inscriptions found in both Axum and Meroe. 
> 
> Although the Aksumite presence was likely short-lived, 
> it prompted the dissolution of the Kushite kingdom into the three polities of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. 
> 
> The Kingdom of Alodia subsequently gained 
> control of the southern territory of the former Meroitic empire, including parts of Eritrea.
>
> Long overshadowed by Egypt, archaeological discoveries since the late 20th century 
> have revealed Kush to be an advanced civilization. 
> 
> The Kushites had their own unique language and script; 
> maintained a complex economy based on trade and industry; mastered archery; 
> and developed a complex, urban society with uniquely high levels of female participation.
