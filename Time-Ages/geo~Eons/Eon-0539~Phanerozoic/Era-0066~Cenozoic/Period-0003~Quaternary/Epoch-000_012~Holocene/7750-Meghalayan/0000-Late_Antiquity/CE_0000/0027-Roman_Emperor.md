# [[0027-Roman_Emperor]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Roman emperor was the ruler and monarchical head of state of the Roman Empire, 
> starting with the granting of the title [[0027-Roman_Emperor/Augustus|Augustus]] to Octavian in 27 BC. 
> 
> The title of imperator, originally a military honorific, 
> was usually used alongside caesar, originally a cognomen. 
> When a given Roman is described as becoming emperor in English, 
> it generally reflects his accession as Augustus, and later as Basileus (in [[Constantinople]]). 
> Early emperors also used the title princeps ("first one") 
> alongside other Republican titles, notably consul and pontifex maximus.
>
> The legitimacy of an emperor's rule depended on his control of the Roman army 
> and recognition by the Senate; 
> an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, 
> or by the Senate, or both. 
> 
> The first emperors reigned alone; 
> later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors 
> to secure the succession or to divide the administration of the empire between them. 
> 
> The office of emperor was thought to be distinct from that of a rex ("king"). 
> Augustus, the first emperor, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch. 
> 
> For **the first three hundred years of Roman emperors**, 
> efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of the Republic, 
> **fearing any association with the kings** who ruled Rome prior to the Republic.
>
> From Diocletian on, whose reformed tetrarchy divided the position into one emperor in the West 
> and one in the East, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style. 
> 
> Although succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary 
> if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy, 
> so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted, 
> which often led to several claimants to the throne. 
> 
> Despite this, elements of the republican institutional framework (Senate, consuls, and magistrates) 
> were preserved even after the end of the Western Empire.
>
> Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, moved the capital from Rome to Constantinople, 
> formerly known as Byzantium, in 330 AD. 
> 
> Roman emperors had always held high religious offices; 
> under Constantine there arose the specifically Christian idea 
> that the emperor was God's chosen ruler on earth, 
> a special protector and leader of the Christian Church, a position later termed Caesaropapism. 
> In practice, an emperor's authority on Church matters was frequently subject to challenge. 
> 
> The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century 
> after multiple invasions by Germanic barbarian tribes, 
> with no recognised claimant to Emperor of the West remaining after the death of Julius Nepos in 480. 
> 
> Instead, the Eastern emperor Zeno proclaimed himself 
> as the sole emperor of a theoretically undivided Roman Empire 
> (although in practice he had no authority in the West). 
> 
> The subsequent Eastern emperors ruling from Constantinople styled themselves 
> as "Basileus of the Romans" (Ancient Greek: βασιλεύς Ῥωμαίων, Basileus Romaíon) 
> but are often referred to in modern scholarship as Byzantine emperors.
>
> The papacy and Germanic kingdoms of the West acknowledged the Eastern emperors 
> until the accession of Empress Irene in 797. 
> After this, the papacy created a rival lineage of Roman emperors in western Europe, 
> the Holy Roman Emperors, which ruled the Holy Roman Empire for most of the period between 800 and 1806. 
> 
> These emperors were never recognized in Constantinople 
> and their coronations resulted in the medieval problem of two emperors. 
> 
> The last Eastern emperor was Constantine XI Palaiologos, 
> who died during the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. 
> 
> After conquering the city, Ottoman sultans adopted the title "Caesar of the Romans" (kayser-i Rûm). 
> A Byzantine group of claimant emperors existed in the Empire of Trebizond 
> until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1461, although they had used a modified title since 1282.
