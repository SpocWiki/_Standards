The **Pleistocene** and **Paleolithic** are **not the same**, though they **overlap almost entirely in time**. 

The **Paleolithic** (“Old Stone Age”) is an _archaeological cultural stage_ 
based on **human tool use and behavioral development**, not geology. 
It overlaps with most of the geologic Pleistocene and a small part of the Holocene,
defined by climatic and environmental changes, particularly the **glacial–interglacial cycles**..

## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> The **Paleolithic** or Palaeolithic ( PAY-, PAL-ee-oh-LITH-ik), also called the Old Stone Age 
> (from Greek: παλαιός palaios, "old" and λίθος lithos, "stone"), 
> is a period in human prehistory that is distinguished by the original development of stone tools, 
> and which represents __almost the entire period of human prehistoric technology__. 
> 
> It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, c. 3.3 million years ago, 
> to the end of the Pleistocene, c. 11,650 cal BP.
> 
> The Paleolithic Age in Europe preceded the [[../Epoch-000_012~Holocene/0000-Greenlandian/0000-Mesolithic]] Age, 
> although the date of the transition varies geographically by thousand years. 
> During the Paleolithic Age, hominins grouped together in small societies such as bands 
> and subsisted by gathering plants, fishing, and hunting or scavenging wild animals. 
> 
> The Paleolithic Age is characterized by the use of knapped stone tools, 
> although at the time humans also used __wood and bone__ tools. 
> Other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools, including __leather and vegetable fibers__; 
> however, due to rapid decomposition, these have not survived to any great degree.
>
> About 50,000 years ago, a marked increase in the diversity of artifacts occurred. 
> In Africa, bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archaeological record. 
> 
> The first evidence of human fishing is also noted, 
> from artifacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. 
> 
> Archaeologists classify artifacts of the last 50,000 years into many different categories, 
> such as projectile points, engraving tools, sharp knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools.
>
> Humankind gradually evolved from early members of the genus Homo—
> such as Homo habilis, who used simple stone tools—into anatomically modern humans 
> as well as behaviourally modern humans by the Upper Paleolithic. 
> 
> During the end of the Paleolithic Age, specifically the Middle or Upper Paleolithic Age, 
> humans began to produce the earliest works of art 
> and to engage in religious or spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual. 
> 
> Conditions during the Paleolithic Age went through a set of glacial and interglacial periods 
> in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures. 
> 
> Archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source 
> populations of Paleolithic humans survived in sparsely-wooded areas 
> and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest-cover. 
> 
> By c. 50,000 – c. 40,000 BP, the first humans set foot in Australia. 
> By c. 45,000 BP, humans lived at 61°N latitude in Europe. 
> By c. 30,000 BP, Japan was reached, and 
> by c. 27,000 BP humans were present in Siberia, above the Arctic Circle. 
> 
> By the end of the Upper Paleolithic Age humans had crossed Beringia 
> and expanded throughout the Americas continents.
