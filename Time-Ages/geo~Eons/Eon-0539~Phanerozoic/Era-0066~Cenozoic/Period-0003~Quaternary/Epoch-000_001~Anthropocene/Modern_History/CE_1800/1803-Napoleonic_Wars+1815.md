## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) were a global series of conflicts 
> fought by a fluctuating array of European coalitions 
> against the French First Republic (1803–1804) under the First Consul 
> followed by the First French Empire (1804–1815) under the Emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte. 
> 
> The wars originated in political forces arising from the French Revolution (1789–1799) 
> and from the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802) 
> and produced a period of French domination over Continental Europe. 
> 
> The wars are categorised as seven conflicts, 
> five named after the coalitions that fought Napoleon, 
> plus two named for their respective theatres: 
> - the War of the Third Coalition, 
> - War of the Fourth Coalition, 
> - War of the Fifth Coalition, 
> - War of the Sixth Coalition, 
> - War of the Seventh Coalition, 
> - the Peninsular War, and 
> - the French invasion of Russia.
>
> The first stage of the war broke out when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, 
> alongside the Third Coalition. 
> 
> In December 1805, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz, 
> which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire 
> and thus forced Austria to make peace. 
> 
> Concerned about increasing French power, Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition, 
> which resumed war in October 1806. 
> 
> Napoleon defeated the Prussians at Jena-Auerstedt and the Russians at Friedland, 
> bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. 
> 
> The treaty had failed to end the tension, and war broke out again in 1809, 
> with the Austrian-led Fifth Coalition. 
> At first, the Austrians won a significant victory at Aspern-Essling 
> but were quickly defeated at Wagram.
>
> Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his Continental System, 
> Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal, 
> the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. 
> 
> After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, 
> and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, 
> Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, 
> depose the reigning Spanish royal family, 
> and declare his brother as Joseph I the King of Spain in 1808. 
> 
> The Spanish and Portuguese then revolted with British support, 
> and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after six years of fighting.
>
> Concurrently Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, 
> routinely violated the Continental System, 
> prompting Napoleon to launch a massive invasion in 1812. 
> 
> The resulting campaign ended in disaster for France 
> and the near-destruction of Napoleon's Grande Armée.
>
> Encouraged by the defeat, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Spain, and Russia 
> formed the Sixth Coalition and began a campaign against France, 
> decisively defeating Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813. 
> 
> The allies then invaded France from the east, 
> while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. 
> 
> Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814, 
> forced Napoleon to abdicate in April, exiled him to the island of Elba, 
> and restored power to the Bourbons. 
> 
> Napoleon escaped from exile in February 1815 and reassumed control of France 
> for around one hundred days, igniting the eponymous conflict. 
> 
> The allies formed the Seventh Coalition, which defeated him at Waterloo in June 1815 
> and exiled him to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later in 1821.
>
> The wars had profound consequences on global history, 
> including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, advancements in civil law, 
> the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power, 
> the appearance of independence movements in Spanish America 
> and the subsequent decline of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, 
> the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, 
> and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare. 
> 
> After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna redrew Europe's borders 
> and brought a relative peace to the continent, 
> lasting until the Revolutions of 1848 and the Crimean War in 1853.
