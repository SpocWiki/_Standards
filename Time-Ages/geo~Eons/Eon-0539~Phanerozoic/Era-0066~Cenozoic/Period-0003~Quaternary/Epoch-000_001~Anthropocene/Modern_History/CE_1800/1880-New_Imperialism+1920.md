## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In historical contexts, New Imperialism characterizes a period of colonial expansion 
> by European powers, the United States, and Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
> 
> The period featured an unprecedented pursuit of overseas territorial acquisitions. 
> At the time, states focused on building their empires with new technological advances and developments, 
> expanding their territory through conquest, and exploiting the resources of the subjugated countries. 
> 
> During the era of New Imperialism, the European powers (and Japan) individually conquered almost all of Africa and parts of Asia. 
> 
> The new wave of imperialism reflected ongoing rivalries among the great powers, 
> the economic desire for new resources and markets, and a "civilizing mission" ethos. 
> Many of the colonies established during this era gained independence during the era of decolonization that followed World War II.
>
> The qualifier "new" is used to differentiate modern imperialism from earlier imperial activity, such as the formation of ancient empires and the first wave of European colonization.
>
> The main participants in New Imperialism were the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Russia, the United States, and Japan.
