> The **Berlin Conference** of 1884–1885 was a meeting of colonial powers 
> that concluded with the signing of the General Act of Berlin, 
> an agreement regulating European colonisation and trade in Africa 
> during the New Imperialism period. 
> 
> The conference of fourteen countries was organised by Otto von Bismarck, 
> the first chancellor of Germany, at the request of Leopold II of Belgium 
> at a building (No. 77, now No. 92) on Berlin’s central Wilhelmstrasse. 
> 
> It met on 15 November 1884 and, after an adjournment, 
> concluded on 26 February 1885 with the signing of the General Act. 
> 
> During the conference, attendees also discussed other related issues 
> and agreed on a common framework for the recognition of 
> European ''effective occupation'' of African coastal territory elsewhere on the continent. 
> After the conference, the pace of European claims being made on African territory increased, part of the Scramble for Africa that had already begun.

> The General Act of Berlin can be seen as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa that was already in full swing. The conference contributed to ushering in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, and is sometimes cited as being responsible for the "carve-up of Africa". However, some scholars warn against overstating its role in the colonial partitioning of Africa, drawing attention to the many bilateral agreements concluded before and after the conference. A 2024 study found that the only borders set at the conference were those of the Congo region (and these were subsequently revised), and that most of Africa’s borders did not take their final form until over two decades later. Wm. Roger Louis conceded, however, that "the Berlin Act did have a relevance to the course of the partition" of Africa.

> European powers were also driven by economic motivations, as competition for the vast natural resources on the continent were crucial for industrialization and expansion. As European industries grew, the raw materials such as rubber, minerals, ivory, and cotton made Africa highly valuable. In addition, the control over the vast African markets allowed European countries to sell manufactured goods, leading to economic dominance in resources and trade. The Berlin Conference materialized these ambitions, formalizing claims to areas rich in resources and establishing rules to deter conflict among the European powers. Economic rivalries between Britain and France increased the urgency to secure colonies before monopolies were created in key areas such as the Congo Basin. Europe had an industrial surplus which led them to find markets abroad, making the African colonies both their supplier of raw materials as well as consumers of European products.
