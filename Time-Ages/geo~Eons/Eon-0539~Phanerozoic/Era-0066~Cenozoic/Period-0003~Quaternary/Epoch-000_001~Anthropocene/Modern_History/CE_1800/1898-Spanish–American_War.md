> The **Spanish–American War** (April 21 – August 13, 1898) 
> was fought between Spain and the United States in 1898. 
> 
> It began with the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba, 
> and resulted in the U.S. acquiring sovereignty over Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, 
> and establishing a protectorate over Cuba. 
> 
> It represented U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence and Philippine Revolution, 
> with the latter later leading to the Philippine–American War. 
> 
> The Spanish–American War brought an 
> end to almost four centuries of Spanish presence in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific; 
> the United States meanwhile not only became a major world power, 
> but also gained several island possessions spanning the globe, 
> which provoked rancorous debate over the wisdom of expansionism.
>
> The 19th century represented a clear decline for the Spanish Empire, 
> while the United States went from a newly founded country to a rising power. 
> 
> In 1895, Cuban nationalists began a revolt against Spanish rule, 
> which was brutally suppressed by the colonial authorities. 
> 
> W. Joseph Campbell argues that yellow journalism in the U.S. 
> exaggerated the atrocities in Cuba to sell more newspapers and magazines, 
> which swayed American public opinion in support of the rebels. 
> 
> But historian Andrea Pitzer also points to the actual shift toward 
> savagery of the Spanish military leadership, who adopted the brutal reconcentration policy 
> after replacing the relatively conservative Governor-General of Cuba Arsenio Martínez Campos 
> with the more unscrupulous and aggressive Valeriano Weyler, nicknamed "The Butcher." 
> 
> President Grover Cleveland resisted mounting demands for U.S. intervention, 
> as did his successor William McKinley. 
> Though not seeking a war, McKinley made preparations in readiness for one.
>
> In January 1898, the U.S. Navy armored cruiser USS Maine was sent to Havana 
> to provide protection for U.S. citizens. 
> 
> After the Maine was sunk by a mysterious explosion in the harbor on February 15, 1898, 
> political pressures pushed McKinley to receive congressional authority to use military force. 
> 
> On April 21, the U.S. began a blockade of Cuba, and soon after Spain and the U.S. declared war. 
> The war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, 
> where American war advocates correctly anticipated that U.S. naval power would prove decisive. 
> 
> On May 1, a squadron of U.S. warships 
> destroyed the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay in the Philippines and captured the harbor. 
> 
> The first U.S. Marines landed in Cuba on June 10 in the island's southeast, 
> moving west and engaging in the Battles of El Caney and San Juan Hill on July 1 
> and then destroying the fleet at and capturing Santiago de Cuba on July 17. 
> 
> On June 20, the island of Guam surrendered without resistance, 
> and on July 25, U.S. troops landed on Puerto Rico, of which a blockade had begun on May 8 
> and where fighting continued until an armistice was signed on August 13.
>
> The war formally ended with the 1898 Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10 
> with terms favorable to the U.S. 
> 
> The treaty ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the U.S., 
> and set Cuba up to become an independent state in 1902, 
> although in practice it became a U.S. protectorate. 
> 
> The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20 million ($760 million today) to Spain 
> by the U.S. to cover infrastructure owned by Spain. 
> 
> In Spain, the defeat in the war was a profound shock to the national psyche 
> and provoked a thorough philosophical and artistic reevaluation of Spanish society 
> known as the Generation of '98.
