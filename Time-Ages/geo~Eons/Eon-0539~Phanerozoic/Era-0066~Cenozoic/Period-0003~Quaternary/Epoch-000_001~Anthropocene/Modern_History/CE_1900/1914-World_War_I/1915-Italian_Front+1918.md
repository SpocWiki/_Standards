## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Italian front (Italian: Fronte italiano; German: Südwestfront) 
> was one of the main theatres of war of World War I. 
> 
> It involved a series of military engagements along the border 
> between the Kingdom of Italy and Austria-Hungary from 1915 to 1918. 
> 
> Following secret promises made by the Entente in the 1915 Treaty of London, 
> the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the Entente side, 
> aiming to annex the Austrian Littoral, northern Dalmatia 
> and the territories of present-day Trentino and South Tyrol. 
> 
> The front soon bogged down into trench warfare, similar to that on the Western Front, 
> but at high altitudes and with extremely cold winters. 
> 
> Fighting along the front displaced much of the local population, 
> and several thousand civilians died from malnutrition and illness 
> in Kingdom of Italy and Austro-Hungarian refugee camps. 
>
> Military operations came to an end in 1918 with Italian victory 
> and the capture of Trento and Trieste by the Royal Italian Army. 
> 
> Austria-Hungary disintegrated due to military defeats 
> and subsequent turmoils caused by pacifists and separatists. 
> 
> All military operations on the front came to an end with the entry into force of the armistice of Villa Giusti on 4 November 1918. Italy entered into World War I also with the aim of completing national unity with the annexation of Trentino-Alto Adige and the Julian March; for this reason, the Italian intervention in the World War I is also considered the Fourth Italian War of Independence, in a historiographical perspective that identifies in the latter the conclusion of the unification of Italy, whose military actions began during the revolutions of 1848 with the First Italian War of Independence.
