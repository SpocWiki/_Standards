> The Second Boer War (Afrikaans: Tweede Vryheidsoorlog, lit. 'Second Freedom War', 
> 11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902), also known as the Boer War, Transvaal War, Anglo–Boer War, 
> or South African War, was a conflict fought between the British Empire and the Boer republics 
> (the South African Republic and Orange Free State) over Britain's influence in Southern Africa.
>
> The Witwatersrand Gold Rush caused an influx of "foreigners" (Uitlanders) 
> to the South African Republic (SAR), mostly British from the Cape Colony. 
> 
> As they were permitted to vote only after 14 years residence, 
> they protested to the British authorities in the Cape. 
> Negotiations failed at the botched Bloemfontein Conference in June 1899. 
> The conflict broke out in October after the British government decided to send 10,000 troops.
>
> The war had three phases. 
> 
> In the first, the Boers mounted preemptive strikes 
> into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, 
> besieging British garrisons at Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley. 
> 
> The Boers won victories at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso and Spion Kop. 
> 
> In the second phase, British fortunes changed 
> when their commanding officer, General Redvers Buller, 
> was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, 
> who relieved the besieged cities and invaded the Boer republics 
> at the head of a 180,000-strong expeditionary force. 
> 
> The Boers, aware they were unable to resist such a force, 
> refrained from fighting pitched battles, allowing the British to occupy both republics and their capitals. 
> 
> Boer politicians fled or went into hiding; the British annexed the two republics in 1900. 
> In Britain, the Conservative ministry attempted to capitalise 
> by calling an early general election, dubbed a "khaki election". 
> 
> In the third phase, Boer fighters launched a guerrilla campaign. 
> They used hit-and-run attacks and ambushes against the British for two years.
>
> The campaign proved difficult for the British to defeat, 
> due to unfamiliarity with guerrilla tactics and support among civilians. 
> 
> British high command ordered scorched earth policies as part of a counterinsurgency campaign. 
> 
> Over 100,000 Boer civilians were forcibly relocated into concentration camps, 
> where 26,000 died, by starvation and disease. 
> 
> Black Africans were interned to prevent them from supplying the Boers; 20,000 died. 
> 
> British mounted infantry were deployed to track down guerrillas, 
> and few combatants were killed in action, most dying from disease. 
> 
> Kitchener offered terms to remaining Boer leaders to end the conflict. 
> 
> Eager to ensure Boers were released from the camps, 
> most Boer commanders accepted the terms in the Treaty of Vereeniging, 
> surrendering in May 1902. 
> 
> The former republics were transformed 
> into the British colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River, 
> and in 1910 were merged with the Natal and Cape Colonies 
> to form the Union of South Africa, a self-governing colony within the British Empire.
>
> British expeditionary efforts were aided significantly by colonial forces from the Cape Colony, the Natal, Rhodesia, and many volunteers from the British Empire. 
> 
> Black African recruits contributed increasingly to the British effort. 
> 
> International public opinion was sympathetic to the Boers and hostile to the British. 
> 
> Even within the UK, there existed significant opposition to the war. 
> 
> As a result, the Boer cause attracted volunteers from neutral countries, 
> including the German Empire, US, Russia and parts of the British Empire such as Australia and Ireland. 
> 
> Some consider the war the beginning of questioning the British Empire's global dominance, 
> due to the war's surprising duration and unforeseen losses suffered by the British. 
> 
> A trial for British war crimes, including the killings of civilians and prisoners, 
> was opened in January 1902. 
> 
> The war had a lasting effect on the region and on British domestic politics.
