> The **Beneš decrees** were a series of laws drafted by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile 
> in the absence of the Czechoslovak parliament 
> during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II. 
> 
> They were issued by President Edvard Beneš from 21 July 1940 to 27 October 1945 
> and retroactively ratified by the Interim National Assembly of Czechoslovakia on 6 March 1946.
>
> The decrees dealt with various aspects of the restoration of Czechoslovakia and its legal system, 
> denazification, and reconstruction of the country. 
> 
> In journalism and political history, the term "Beneš decrees" 
> refers to the decrees of the president and the ordinances of the Slovak National Council (SNR) 
> concerning the status of ethnic Germans, Hungarians and others in postwar Czechoslovakia 
> and represented Czechoslovakia's legal framework for the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. 
>
> The decrees treated German and Hungarian citizens as collective criminals, 
> enforcing racial segregation and disenfranchisement. 
> 
> As a result, almost all ethnic Germans and Hungarians, 
> some of whom had ancestors who had lived in Czechoslovakia for centuries prior to World War II, 
> or those who had settled there during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, 
> lost their Czechoslovak citizenship and property. 
> 
> The state then expelled them  from their homes. 
> Some of them died during the expulsion process which took place during the late 1940s. 
> The Beneš decrees were enforced differently in different parts of the country 
> with some decrees being valid only in Bohemia and Moravia, while the SNR's ordinances were enforced in Slovakia.
>
> The decrees also allowed Hungarian civil servants to be dismissed, health care to be withdrawn, 
> the use of the Hungarian language in public offices and church services to be banned, 
> Hungarian students to be excluded from universities, 
> Hungarian cultural and social associations to be dissolved, 
> the publication of books and newspapers in Hungarian to be banned, 
> and ethnic Hungarians were not even to be allowed to start civil procedures. 
> 
> Anyone who had documents proving their Slavic nationality 
> was rewarded with the option to move into the confiscated houses. 
>
> The decrees remain politically controversial in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. 
> They were never repealed and are **still used to confiscate property from Hungarians in Slovakia** 
> on the grounds that their ancestors should have lost their property.
