## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Warsaw Pact (WP), formally the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance 
> (TFCMA), was a collective defense treaty signed in Warsaw, Poland, 
> between the Soviet Union and seven other Eastern Bloc socialist republics 
> in Central and Eastern Europe in May 1955, during the Cold War. 
> 
> The term "Warsaw Pact" commonly refers to both the treaty itself 
> and its resultant military alliance, the Warsaw Pact Organisation (WPO) 
> (also known as ‘Warsaw Treaty Organization’ (‘WTO’)). 
> 
> The Warsaw Pact was the military complement 
> to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), 
> the economic organization for the Eastern Bloc states.
>
> Dominated by the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact was established 
> as a balance of power or counterweight to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
> and the Western Bloc. 
> 
> There was no direct military confrontation between the two organizations; 
> instead, the conflict was fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. 
> Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact led to the expansion of military forces 
> and their integration into the respective blocs. 
> 
> The Warsaw Pact's largest military engagement was 
> the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, one of its own member states, in August 1968. 
> 
> All member states participated except for Albania and Romania, 
> resulting in Albania's withdrawal from the pact less than one month later. 
> The pact began to unravel with the spread of the Revolutions of 1989 
> through the Eastern Bloc, beginning with the Solidarity movement in Poland, 
> its electoral success in June 1989 and the [[1989-Pan-European_Picnic]] in August.
>
> East Germany withdrew from the pact following German reunification in 1990. 
> On 25 February 1991, at a meeting in Hungary, the pact ceased to exist 
> via joint declaration by the defense and foreign ministers of the six remaining member states. 
> 
> The USSR itself was dissolved in December 1991, although most of the former 
> Soviet republics formed the Collective Security Treaty Organization shortly thereafter. 
> 
> In the following 20 years, the Warsaw Pact countries outside the USSR each joined NATO 
> (East Germany through its reunification with West Germany; 
> and the Czech Republic and Slovakia as separate countries), as did the Baltic states.
