## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Kellogg–Briand Pact or Pact of Paris – 
> officially the General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy – 
> is a 1928 international agreement on peace in which signatory states promised 
> not to use war to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature 
> or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them". 
> 
> The pact was signed by Germany, France, and the United States 
> on 27 August 1928, and by most other states soon after. 
> Sponsored by France and the U.S., the Pact is named after its authors, 
> United States Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg 
> and French foreign minister Aristide Briand. 
> The pact was concluded outside the League of Nations and remains in effect.
>
> A common criticism is that the Kellogg–Briand Pact did not live up to all of its aims 
> but has arguably had some success. 
> It was unable to prevent the Second World War 
> but was the basis for trial and execution of wartime German leaders in 1946. 
> 
> Furthermore, declared wars became very rare after 1945. 
> It has been ridiculed for its moralism, legalism, and lack of influence on foreign policy. 
> The pact had no mechanism for enforcement, and 
> many historians and political scientists see it as mostly irrelevant and ineffective. 
> 
> Nevertheless, the pact served as the legal basis 
> for the concept of a crime against peace, 
> for which the Nuremberg Tribunal and Tokyo Tribunal tried 
> and executed the top leaders responsible for starting World War II.
>
> Similar provisions to those in the Kellogg–Briand Pact 
> were later incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations and other treaties, 
> which gave rise to a more activist American foreign policy which began with the signing of the pact.
