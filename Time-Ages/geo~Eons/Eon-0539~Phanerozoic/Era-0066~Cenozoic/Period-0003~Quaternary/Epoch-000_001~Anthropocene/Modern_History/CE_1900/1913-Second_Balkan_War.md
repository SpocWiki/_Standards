> The Second Balkan War (29 June – 10 August 1913) was a conflict fought 
> between the Kingdom of Bulgaria and its former Balkan League allies, Serbia and Greece, 
> who were later joined by Romania and the Ottoman Empire. 
> 
> The war began when Bulgaria, unhappy with the division of territory after the First Balkan War, 
> launched attacks on Serbian and Greek forces, who repelled the offensive and pushed into Bulgarian territory. 
> 
> With most of Bulgaria’s army committed in the south, Romania intervened from the north. 
> The Ottoman Empire also took advantage of the situation to recover territories lost the previous year.
>
> As Bulgaria suffered military setbacks on multiple fronts 
> and Romanian forces advanced towards its capital, Sofia, it requested an armistice. 
> 
> The war ended with the Treaty of Bucharest, which compelled Bulgaria to cede significant territory: 
> - Southern Dobruja to Romania, 
> - parts of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, 
> - and Adrianople (Edirne) to the Ottoman Empire under the separate Treaty of Constantinople.
>
> The war altered the political balance in the Balkans and intensified regional tensions. 
> Serbia expanded its territory and influence, heightening its rivalry with Austria-Hungary. 
> Bulgaria, weakened by defeat and territorial losses, 
> would later align with the Central Powers in the First World War.
