> The Winter War was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. 
> It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, 
> three months after the outbreak of World War II, 
> and ended three and a half months later 
> with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. 
> 
> Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, 
> the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. 
> 
> The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal 
> and expelled the Soviet Union from its organization.
>
> The Soviets made several demands, including that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons — primarily the protection of Leningrad, 32 km (20 mi) from the Finnish border. 
> 
> When Finland refused, the Soviets invaded.  
> Most sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, 
> and cite the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government 
> and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols as evidence of this, 
> while other sources argue against the idea of a full Soviet conquest. 
> 
> Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months 
> and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders in temperatures as low as −43 °C. 
> The battles focused mainly on Taipale along the Karelian Isthmus, 
> on Kollaa in Ladoga Karelia and on Raate Road in Kainuu, 
> but there were also battles in Lapland and North Karelia.
>
> Following the initial setbacks, the Soviets reduced their strategic objectives 
> and put an end to the puppet Finnish communist government in late January 1940, 
> and informed the legitimate Finnish government that they were willing to negotiate peace. 
> 
> After the Soviet military reorganized and adopted different tactics, 
> they renewed their offensive in February 1940 
> and overcame the Finnish defences on the Karelian Isthmus. 
> This left the Finnish army in the main theatre of war near the breaking point, 
> with a retreat seeming inevitable. 
> 
> Consequently, Finnish commander-in-chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim 
> urged a peace deal with the Soviets, while the Finns still retained bargaining power.
>
> Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty 
> in which Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. 
> Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. 
> 
> Their gains exceeded their pre-war demands, 
> and the Soviets received substantial territories along Lake Ladoga and further north. 
> 
> Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation. 
> The poor performance of the Red Army encouraged German Chancellor Adolf Hitler 
> to believe that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful 
> and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military. 
> 
> After 15 months of Interim Peace, in June 1941, 
> Germany commenced Operation Barbarossa, 
> and the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviets began.
