> The 1911 Revolution, also known as the Xinhai Revolution or Hsinhai Revolution, 
> ended China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing dynasty, 
> and led to the establishment of the Republic of China (ROC). 
> 
> The revolution was the culmination of a decade of agitation, revolts, and uprisings. 
> Its success marked the collapse of the Chinese monarchy, 
> the end of over two millennia of imperial rule in China and the 267-year reign of the Qing, 
> and the beginning of China's early republican era.
>
> The Qing had long struggled to reform the government and resist foreign aggression, 
> but conservatives in the Qing court opposed the program of reforms after 1900 
> as too radical and reformers considered it too slow. 
> 
> Several factions, including underground anti-Qing groups, revolutionaries in exile, 
> reformers who wanted to save the monarchy by modernizing it, 
> and activists across the country debated how or whether to overthrow the Qing dynasty. 
> 
> The flashpoint came on 10 October 1911 with the Wuchang Uprising, 
> an armed rebellion by members of the New Army. 
> 
> Similar revolts then broke out spontaneously around the country, 
> and revolutionaries in every province renounced the Qing dynasty. 
> 
> On 1 November 1911, the Qing court appointed Yuan Shikai (leader of the Beiyang Army) 
> as prime minister, and he began negotiations with the revolutionaries.
>
> In Nanjing, revolutionary forces created a provisional coalition government. 
> On 1 January 1912, the Advisory Council declared the establishment of the Republic of China, with Sun Yat-sen, leader of the Tongmenghui, as President of the Republic of China. 
> 
> A brief civil war between the North and the South ended in compromise. 
> Sun resigned in favor of Yuan, 
> who would become president of the new national government 
> if he could secure the abdication of the Qing emperor. 
> 
> The edict of abdication of the six-year-old Xuantong Emperor 
> was promulgated on 12 February 1912. 
> Yuan was sworn in as president on 10 March 1912.
>
> In December 1915, 
> Yuan restored the monarchy and proclaimed himself the Hongxian Emperor, 
> but the move was met with strong opposition by the population and the Army, 
> leading to his abdication in March 1916 and the Republic's reinstatement. 
> 
> Yuan's failure to consolidate a legitimate central government before his death in June 1916 
> led to decades of political division and warlordism, 
> including an attempt at imperial restoration of the Qing dynasty.
>
> The name "Xinhai Revolution" derives from the traditional Chinese calendar, where 
> "Xinhai" (辛亥) is the label corresponding to 1911 according to the sexagenary cycle. 
> 
> The governments of both Taiwan and China consider themselves the 
> legitimate successors to the 1911 Revolution and honor the ideals of the revolution, 
> including nationalism, republicanism, modernization of China, and national unity. 
> 
> 10 October is the National Day of the Republic of China on Taiwan, 
> and the Anniversary of the 1911 Revolution in China.
