> The Imjin War (Korean: 임진왜란; Hanja: 壬辰倭亂) was a series of two Japanese invasions of Korea: 
> - an initial invasion in 1592 also individually called the "Imjin War", 
> - a brief truce in 1596, and 
> - a second invasion in 1597 called the Chŏngyu War (정유재란; 丁酉再亂). 
> The conflict ended in 1598 with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the Korean Peninsula 
> after a military stalemate in Korea's southern provinces.
>
> The invasions were launched by Toyotomi Hideyoshi 
> with the intent of conquering the Korean Peninsula and China proper, 
> which were ruled by the Joseon and Ming dynasties, respectively. 
> 
> Japan quickly succeeded in occupying large portions of the Korean Peninsula, 
> but the contribution of reinforcements by the Ming, 
> as well as the disruption of Japanese supply fleets along the western and southern coasts 
> by the Joseon Navy, forced the Japanese forces 
> to withdraw from Pyongyang and the northern provinces. 
> 
> Afterwards, with righteous armies (Joseon civilian militias) conducting guerrilla warfare against the occupying Japanese forces and supply difficulties hampering both sides, neither force was able to mount a successful offensive or gain any additional territory, resulting in a military stalemate. The first phase of the invasion ended in 1596, and was followed afterwards by ultimately unsuccessful peace negotiations between Japan and the Ming.
>
> In 1597, Japan renewed its offensive by invading Korea a second time. The pattern of the second invasion largely mirrored that of the first. The Japanese had initial successes on land, capturing several cities and fortresses, only to be halted and forced to withdraw to the southern coastal regions of the peninsula. However, the pursuing Ming and Joseon forces were unable to dislodge the Japanese from these positions, where both sides again became locked in a ten-month-long military stalemate.
>
> With Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death in 1598, limited progress on land, and continued disruption of supply lines by the Joseon Navy, the Japanese forces in Korea were ordered to withdraw back to Japan by the new governing Council of Five Elders. Final peace negotiations between the parties followed, and continued for several years, ultimately resulting in the normalization of relations.
