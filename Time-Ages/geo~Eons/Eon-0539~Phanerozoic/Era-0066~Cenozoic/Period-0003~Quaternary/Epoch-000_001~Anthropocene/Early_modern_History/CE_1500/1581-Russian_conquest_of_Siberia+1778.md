## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Russian conquest of Siberia took place during 1581–1778, 
> when the Khanate of Sibir became a loose political structure of vassalages 
> that were being undermined by the activities of Russian explorers. 
> 
> Although outnumbered, the Russians pressured the various family-based tribes 
> into changing their loyalties and establishing distant forts 
> from which they conducted raids. 
> 
> It is traditionally considered that Yermak Timofeyevich's campaign 
> against the Siberian Khanate began in 1581. 
> 
> The annexation of Siberia and the Far East to Russia was resisted by local residents 
> and took place against the backdrop of fierce battles 
> between the indigenous peoples of Siberia and the Russian [[../Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~East/Ukraine/Cossack|Cossack]]s, 
> who often committed atrocities against indigenous Siberians. 
> 
> The conquest of the region was a spontaneous event 
> organized by a group of adventurers; 
> it is one of the early European colonial campaigns.
