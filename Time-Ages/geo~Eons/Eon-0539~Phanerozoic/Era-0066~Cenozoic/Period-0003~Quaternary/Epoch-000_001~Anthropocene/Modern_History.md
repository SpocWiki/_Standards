> The modern era or the modern period is the current historical period of human history. 
> It was originally applied to the history of Europe and Western history 
> for events that came after the Middle Ages, often from around the year 1500, 
> like the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism. 
> 
> From the 1990s, it is more common among historians to refer to 
> the period after the Middle Ages and up to the 19th century as the early modern period. 
> The modern period is today more often used for events from the 19th century until today. 
> The time from the end of World War II (1945) can also be described as contemporary history.
>
> The common definition of the modern period today is often associated with events like the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the transition to nationalism toward the liberal international order.
>
> The modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of science, politics, warfare, and technology. 
> 
> It has also been an Age of Discovery and globalization. 
> During this time, the European powers and later their colonies, 
> strengthened its political, economic, and cultural colonization of the rest of the world. 
> It also created a new modern lifestyle 
> and has permanently changed the way people around the world live. 
>
> In the  19th and early 20th century, modernist art, politics, science, and culture 
> have come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, 
> but almost every area on the globe, 
> including movements thought of as opposed to the western world and globalization. 
> 
> The modern era is closely associated with the 
> development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization, 
> and a belief in the positive possibilities of technological and political progress.
>
> The brutal wars and other conflicts of this era, 
> many of which come from the effects of rapid change, 
> and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, 
> have led to many reactions against modern development. 
> 
> Optimism and the belief in constant progress 
> have been most recently criticized by postmodernism, 
> while the dominance of Western Europe and North America over the rest of the world 
> has been criticized by postcolonial theory.
