## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **History** is the systematic study of the past. 
> As an academic discipline, it analyzes and interprets evidence to construct narratives about 
> what happened and explain why it happened, __focusing primarily on the human past__. 
> 
> Some theorists categorize history as a social science, 
> while others see it as part of the humanities or consider it a hybrid discipline. 
> 
> Similar debates surround the purpose of history, for example, whether its main aim is theoretical, 
> to uncover the truth, or practical, to learn lessons from the past. 
> 
> In a slightly different sense, the term history refers not to an academic field 
> but to the past itself or to individual texts about the past.
>
> History is a broad discipline encompassing many branches. 
> 
> Some focus on specific time periods, such as ancient history, 
> while others concentrate on particular geographic regions, such as the history of Africa. 
> 
> Thematic categorizations include political history, social history, and economic history. 
> Branches associated with specific research methods include 
> - quantitative history, 
> - comparative history, and 
> - oral history.
>
> Historical research relies on primary and secondary sources 
> to reconstruct past events and validate interpretations. 
> 
> Source criticism is used to evaluate these sources, 
> assessing their authenticity, content, and reliability. 
> Historians integrate the perspectives of several individual sources 
> to develop a coherent narrative. 
> 
> Different schools of thought, such as positivism, the Annales school, Marxism, 
> and postmodernism, have distinct methodological approaches.
>
> History emerged as a field of inquiry in the ancient period to replace myth-infused narratives, 
> with influential early traditions originating in Greece, China, and later also in the Islamic world. 
> 
> Historical writing evolved throughout the ages and became increasingly professional, 
> particularly during the 19th century, 
> when a rigorous methodology and various academic institutions were established. 
> 
> History is related to many fields, including historiography, philosophy, education, and politics.
