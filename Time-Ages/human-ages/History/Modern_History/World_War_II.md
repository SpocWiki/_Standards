> **World War II** or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) 
> was a global conflict between two major alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. 
> 
> The vast majority of the world's countries, including all the great powers, 
> fought as part of these military alliances. 
> 
> Many participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, 
> and scientific capabilities into this total war, 
> blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. 
> 
> Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres 
> and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. 
> 
> It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities. 
> Millions died due to genocides, including the Holocaust, 
> as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. 
> In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, 
> and war crime tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
>
> The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included 
> the rise of fascism in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, 
> Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in the aftermath of World War I. 
> 
> World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, 
> when [[World_War_II/Nazi-Germany]], under [[World_War_II/Hitler,Adolf]], invaded [[Poland]]. 
> The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. 
> Under the [[World_War_II/Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact]] of August 1939, 
> Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out 
> their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania. 
> From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, 
> Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe 
> in a military alliance called the Axis with Italy, Japan, and other countries. 
> 
> Following the onset of campaigns in North and East Africa, 
> and the fall of France in mid-1940, 
> the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, 
> with the war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, 
> and the Battle of the Atlantic. 
> 
> In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, 
> opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.
>
> Japan aimed to dominate East Asia and the Asia-Pacific, 
> and by 1937 was at war with the Republic of China. 
> 
> In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories 
> with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, 
> including an attack on Pearl Harbor 
> which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. 
> 
> The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. 
> Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, 
> but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; 
> 
> Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. 
> Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, 
> the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—
> cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. 
> In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, 
> while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed Germany and its allies back. 
> During 1944–1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, 
> while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands. 
> 
> The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; 
> the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, 
> culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; 
> and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. 
> 
> Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, 
> the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima on 6 August 
> and Nagasaki on 9 August. 
> 
> Faced with imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, 
> the possibility of more atomic bombings, 
> and the Soviet Union's declared entry into the war against Japan 
> on the eve of invading Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, 
> signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945.
>
> World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, 
> and it set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century 
> and into the 21st century. 
> 
> The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation 
> and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—
> China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—
> becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. 
> 
> The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, 
> setting the stage for the [[Cold_War]]. 
> In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, 
> triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. 
> Most countries whose industries had been damaged 
> moved towards economic recovery and expansion.
