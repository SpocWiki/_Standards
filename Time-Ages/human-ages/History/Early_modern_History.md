> The early modern period is a historical period that is part of, or (depending on the historian) 
> immediately preceded, the modern period, with divisions based primarily on the history of Europe 
> and the broader concept of modernity. 
> 
> There is no exact date that marks the beginning or end of the period and its extent may vary 
> depending on the area of history being studied. 
> In general, the early modern period is considered to have lasted 
> from around the start of the 16th century 
> to the start of the 19th century (about 1500ï¿½1800). 
> 
> In a European context, it is defined as the period following the Middle Ages and preceding the advent of modernity; but the dates of these boundaries are far from universally agreed. In the context of global history, the early modern period is often used even in contexts where there is no equivalent "medieval" period.
>
> Various events and historical transitions have been proposed as the start of the early modern period, including the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the start of the Renaissance, the end of the Crusades, the Reformation in Germany giving rise to Protestantism and the beginning of the Age of Discovery and with it the onset of the first wave of European colonization. Its end is often marked by the French Revolution, and sometimes also the American Revolution or Napoleon's rise to power, with the advent of the second wave modern colonization of New Imperialism.
>
> Historians in recent decades have argued that, from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its spreading globalizing character. New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of mercantilism as an economic theory. Other notable trends of the period include the development of experimental science, increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of nation states.
