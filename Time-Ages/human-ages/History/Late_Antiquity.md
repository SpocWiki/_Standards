> Late antiquity is sometimes defined as spanning from the end of classical antiquity 
> to the local start of the Middle Ages, 
> from around the late 3rd century up to the 7th or 8th century in Europe 
> and adjacent areas bordering the Mediterranean Basin depending on location. 
> 
> The popularization of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, 
> who proposed a period between 150 and 750 AD. 
> The Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity defines it as "the period between approximately 250 and 750 AD". 
> Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate. 
> In the West, its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, 
> or even earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire.
