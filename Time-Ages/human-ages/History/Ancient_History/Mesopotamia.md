## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Mesopotamia** is a historical region of West Asia situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river system, 
> in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent. Today, Mesopotamia is known as present-day Iraq. 
> In the broader sense, the historical region of Mesopotamia also includes parts of present-day Iran, 
> Turkey, Syria and Kuwait. 
>
> Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. 
> It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history, 
> including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, 
> the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture". 
> It is recognised as the cradle of some of the world's earliest civilizations.
>
> The Sumerians and Akkadians, each originating from different areas, 
> dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of recorded history (c. 3100 BC) 
> to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. 
> 
> The rise of empires, beginning with Sargon of Akkad around 2350 BC, 
> characterized the subsequent 2,000 years of Mesopotamian history, 
> marked by the succession of kingdoms and empires such as the Akkadian Empire. 
> 
> The early second millennium BC saw the polarization of Mesopotamian society into Assyria in the north 
> and Babylonia in the south. 
> 
> From 900 to 612 BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire asserted control over much of the ancient Near East. 
> Subsequently, the Babylonians, who had long been overshadowed by Assyria, seized power, 
> dominating the region for a century as the final independent Mesopotamian realm until the modern era. 
> In 539 BC, Mesopotamia was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. 
> The area was next conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. 
> After his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire.
>
> Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire. 
> It became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, 
> with western parts of the region coming under ephemeral Roman control. 
> 
> In 226 AD, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians. 
> The division of the region between the Roman Byzantine Empire from 395 AD and the Sassanid Empire 
> lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire 
> and the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines. 
> A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed 
> between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.
