> **Classical antiquity**, also known as the classical era, classical period, classical age, or simply antiquity, 
> is the period of cultural European history between the 8th century BC and the 5th century AD 
> comprising the interwoven civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome 
> known together as the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean Basin. 
> 
> It is the period during which ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished 
> and had major influence throughout much of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia.
>
> Conventionally, it is often considered to begin with the earliest recorded Epic Greek poetry of Homer 
> (8thï¿½7th-century BC) and ends with the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. 
> Such a wide span of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods. 
> Classical antiquity may also refer to an idealized vision among later people of what was, 
> in Edgar Allan Poe's words, "the glory that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome".
>
> The culture of the ancient Greeks, together with some influences from the ancient Near East, 
> was the basis of art, philosophy, society, and education in the Mediterranean and Near East 
> until the Roman imperial period. 
> The Romans preserved, imitated, and spread this culture throughout Europe, 
> until they were able to compete with it. 
> This Greco-Roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, 
> law, educational systems, philosophy, science, warfare, literature, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art 
> and architecture of both the Western, and through it, the modern world.
>
> Surviving fragments of classical culture helped produce a revival beginning during the 14th century 
> which later came to be known as the Renaissance, 
> and various neo-classical revivals occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries.
