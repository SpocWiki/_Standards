> **Nihilism** is a family of philosophical views arguing that life is meaningless, 
> that moral values are baseless, or that knowledge is impossible. 
> 
> Thus, such views reject the basis of certain ideas. 
> Nihilistic views span several branches of philosophy, including 
> ethics, value theory, epistemology, and metaphysics. 
> 
> Nihilism is also described as a broad cultural phenomenon or historical movement 
> that pervades modernity in the Western world.
>
> Existential nihilism asserts that life is inherently meaningless and lacks a higher purpose. 
> By suggesting that all individual and societal achievements are ultimately pointless, 
> it can lead to indifference, lack of motivation, and existential crises. 
> 
> In response, some philosophers propose detachment from worldly concerns, 
> while others seek to discover or create values. 
> 
> Moral nihilism, a related view, denies the objective existence of morality, arguing that moral evaluations and practices rest on misguided assumptions without any foundation in external reality.
>
> In epistemology or the theory of knowledge, nihilism challenges knowledge and truth. According to relativism, knowledge, truth, or meaning are relative to the perspectives of specific individuals or cultural contexts. This implies that there is no independent framework to assess which opinion is ultimately correct. Skeptical interpretations go further by denying the existence of knowledge or truth altogether. In metaphysics, one form of nihilism states that the universe could have been empty without any objects. This view holds that there is no fundamental reason for why something exists rather than nothing. Mereological nihilism asserts that there are only simple objects, like elementary particles, but no composite objects, like tables. Cosmological nihilism is the view that reality is unintelligible and indifferent to human understanding. Other nihilist positions include political, semantic, logical, and therapeutic nihilism.

> Some aspects of nihilism have their roots in ancient philosophy in the form of challenges to established beliefs, values, and practices. However, nihilism is primarily associated with modernity, emerging in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in Germany and Russia through the works of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and Ivan Turgenev. It took center stage in the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche, who understood nihilism as a pervasive cultural trend in which people lose the values and ideals guiding their lives as a result of secularization. In the 20th century, nihilist themes were explored by Dadaism, existentialism, and postmodern philosophy.
