> **Stoicism** is a school of Hellenistic philosophy 
> that flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. 
> Its Name derives from the Greek word 'Stoa' for the Hall in Athens. 
> 
> The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: 
> a well-lived life. 
> 
> The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life 
> spent practicing the four virtues in everyday life—
> - wisdom, 
> - courage, 
> - temperance or moderation, and 
> - justice—
> - as well as living in accordance with nature. 
> It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by [[Zeno of Citium]] around 300 BC,
> after he lost all his wealth in a shipwreck. 
>
> Alongside Aristotle's ethics, 
> the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics. 
> 
> The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, 
> and that external things, such as health, wealth, 
> and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) 
> but have value (only) as "material for virtue to act upon". 
> 
> Many Stoics—such as [[Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]—emphasized that 
> because "virtue is sufficient for happiness", 
> a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. 
> 
> The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, 
> and they believed people should aim to 
> maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is "in accordance with nature". 
> 
> Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy 
> was not what a person said but how a person behaved. 
> To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order, 
> since they believed everything was rooted in nature.
>
> Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, 
> and among its adherents was Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. 
> 
> It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. 
> Since then, it has seen revivals, notably 
> - in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and 
> - in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism), fueled by Forums on the Internet.
