> Modern philosophy is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. 
> It is not a specific doctrine or school (and thus should not be confused with Modernism), 
> although certain assumptions are common to much of it, 
> which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.
>
> The 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. 
> How much of the Renaissance should be included is a matter of dispute, 
> as is whether modernity ended in the 20th century and has been replaced by postmodernity. 
> How one answers these questions will determine the scope of one's use of the term "modern philosophy."
