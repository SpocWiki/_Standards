> **Holism** is the interdisciplinary idea that systems possess properties as wholes 
> apart from the properties of their component parts.
>
> The aphorism "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts", 
> typically attributed to Aristotle, is often given as a summary of this proposal. 
> 
> The concept of holism 
> can inform the methodology for a broad array of scientific fields and lifestyle practices. 
> 
> When applications of holism are said to reveal properties of a whole system 
> beyond those of its parts, 
> these qualities are referred to as emergent properties of that system. 
> 
> Holism in all contexts is often placed in opposition to reductionism, 
> a dominant notion in the philosophy of science 
> that systems containing parts contain no unique properties beyond those parts. 
> 
> Proponents of holism consider the search for emergent properties 
> within systems to be demonstrative of their perspective.
