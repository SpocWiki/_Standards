> **Information** is an abstract concept that refers to something which has the power to inform.  
> At the most fundamental level, it pertains to the interpretation (perhaps formally) of that 
> which may be sensed, or their abstractions.  
> 
> Any natural process that is not completely random and any observable pattern in any medium 
> can be said to convey some amount of information.  
> 
> Whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information, 
> other phenomena and artifacts such as analogue signals, poems, pictures, music 
> or other sounds, and currents convey information in a more continuous form.  
> 
> Information is not knowledge itself, 
> but the meaning that may be derived from a representation through interpretation.
>
> The concept of information is relevant or connected to various concepts, 
> including constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, 
> understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy.
>
> Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step 
> are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step.  
> 
> For example, in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of, 
> each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of, 
> each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of, and so on 
> until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in a given domain.  
> 
> In a digital signal, bits may be interpreted into the symbols, letters, numbers, 
> or structures that convey the information available at the next level up.  
> The key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing.
>
> The derivation of information from a signal or message may be thought of as 
> the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty 
> that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message.
>
> Information may be structured as data. 
> Redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size, which is the theoretical limit of compression.
>
> The information available through a collection of data may be derived by analysis.  
> For example, a restaurant collects data from every customer order. 
> That information may be analyzed to produce knowledge that is put to use 
> when the business subsequently wants to identify the most popular or least popular dish.
>
> Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space, via telecommunication. 
> Information is expressed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation. 
> That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, 
> and in that sense, all information is always conveyed as the content of a message.
>
> Information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation 
> (for example, information may be encoded into a sequence of signs, or transmitted via a signal). 
> It can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication.
>
> The uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence. 
> Uncertainty is proportional to the negative logarithm of the probability of occurrence. 
> Information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that 
> more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty. 
> 
> The bit is a typical unit of information. It is 'that which reduces uncertainty by half'. 
> Other units such as the nat may be used. 
> 
> For example, the information encoded in one "fair" coin flip is log2(2/1) = 1 bit, 
> and in two fair coin flips is log2(4/1) = 2 bits. 
> 
> A 2011 Science article estimates that 97% of technologically stored information 
> was already in digital bits in 2007 and that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age 
> for information storage (with digital storage capacity bypassing analogue for the first time).
