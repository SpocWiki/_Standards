> **Freethought** (sometimes spelled free thought) is an unorthodox attitude or belief.  
>
> A freethinker holds that 
> beliefs should not be formed on the basis of authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma, 
> and should instead be reached by other methods such as logic, reason, 
> and empirical observation. 
> 
> According to the Collins English Dictionary, a freethinker is "One who is mentally free from the conventional bonds of tradition or dogma, and thinks independently." 
> In some contemporary thought in particular, free thought is strongly tied with 
> rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems. 
> 
> The cognitive application of free thought is known as "freethinking", 
> and practitioners of free thought are known as "freethinkers". 
> Modern freethinkers consider free thought to be a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from society. 
>
> The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to refer to people 
> who inquired into the basis of traditional beliefs which were often accepted unquestioningly. 
> 
> Today, freethinking is most closely linked with agnosticism, deism, 
> secularism, humanism, anti-clericalism, and religious critique. 
> 
> The Oxford English Dictionary defines freethinking as, 
> "The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; 
> the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker." 
> 
> Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, scientific inquiry, and logic. 
> The skeptical application of science implies freedom 
> from the intellectually limiting effects of confirmation bias, cognitive bias, 
> conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, or sectarianism.
