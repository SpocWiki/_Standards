> **Insight** is the understanding of a specific cause and effect within a particular context. 
> The term insight can have several related meanings:
> - a piece of information
> - the act or result of understanding the inner nature of things or of seeing intuitively (called noesis in Greek)
>
> an introspection
>
> the power of acute observation and deduction, discernment, and perception, called intellection or noesis
>
> an understanding of cause and effect based on the identification of relationships and behaviors within a model, system, context, or scenario (see artificial intelligence)
>
> An insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the German word Aha-Erlebnis. The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical linguist Karl BÃ¼hler. It is also known as an epiphany, eureka moment, or (for crossword solvers) the penny dropping moment (PDM). Sudden sickening realisations often identify a problem rather than solving it, so Uh-oh rather than Aha moments are seen in negative insight. A further example of negative insight is chagrin which is annoyance at the obviousness of a solution that was missed up until the (perhaps too late) point of insight, an example of this being Homer Simpson's catchphrase exclamation, D'oh!.
