## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Truth** or verity is the property of a Record or [[../../Science/Physics/Measurement|Measurement]] being in accord with fact or reality. 
> In everyday language, it is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality 
> or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences.
>
> Truth is usually held to be the opposite of false statement. 
> The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including 
> philosophy, art, theology, law, and science. 
> 
> Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed 
> rather than being a subject of discussion, including journalism and everyday life. 
> 
> Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, 
> and unable to be explained in simpler terms. 
> 
> Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought 
> to a mind-independent world. 
> This is called the correspondence theory of truth.
>
> Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. 
> There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates. 
> These include the question of defining truth; whether it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth; 
> identifying things as truth-bearers capable of being true or false; 
> if truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if there are other truth values; 
> identifying the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood; 
> the role that truth plays in constituting knowledge; 
> and, if truth is always absolute or if it can be relative to one's perspective.
