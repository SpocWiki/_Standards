## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Inference**s are steps in logical reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; 
> etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". 
> 
> Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, 
> a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BC). 
> 
> Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions 
> from premises known or assumed to be true, 
> with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. 
> 
> Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. 
> 
> A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, 
> contradistinguishing abduction from induction.
>
> Various fields study how inference is done in practice. 
> 
> Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. 
> 
> Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. 
> This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. 
> Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.
