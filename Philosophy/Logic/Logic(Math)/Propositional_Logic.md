## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Propositional logic is a branch of logic. It is also called statement logic, sentential calculus, propositional calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic. 
> Sometimes, it is called first-order propositional logic to contrast it with System F, 
> but it should not be confused with first-order logic. 
> 
> By comparison with first-order logic, truth-functional propositional logic is considered to be zeroth-order logic.
>
> It deals with propositions (which can be true or false) and relations between propositions, 
> including the construction of arguments based on them. 
> 
> Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives 
> representing the truth functions of conjunction, disjunction, implication, biconditional, and negation. 
> Some sources include other connectives, as in the table below.
>
> Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, 
> predicates about them, or quantifiers. 
> However, all the machinery of propositional logic 
> is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. 
> In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.
>
> Propositional logic is typically studied with a formal language, 
> in which propositions are represented by letters, which are called propositional variables. 
> These are then used, together with symbols for connectives, to make propositional formulas. 
> 
> Because of this, the propositional variables are called atomic formulas of a formal propositional language. 
> While the atomic propositions are typically represented by letters of the alphabet, 
> there is a variety of notations to represent the logical connectives. 
> 
> For the benefit of readers who may only be used to a different variant notation for the logical connectives, the following table shows the main notational variants for each of the connectives in propositional logic. 
> Other notations have been used historically, such as Polish notation. 
> For the history of each of these symbols, see the respective articles as well as the article "Logical connective".
>
> The most thoroughly researched branch of propositional logic 
> is classical truth-functional propositional logic, 
> in which formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, true or false. 
> The principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld.
