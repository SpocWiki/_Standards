> Mathematical logic is the study of formal logic within mathematics. 
> Major subareas include model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory 
> (also known as computability theory). 
> 
> Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses 
> the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power. 
> However, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning 
> or to establish foundations of mathematics.
>
> Since its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to and been motivated by 
> the study of foundations of mathematics. 
> 
> This study began in the late 19th century 
> with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry, arithmetic, and analysis. 
> 
> In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert's program 
> to prove the consistency of foundational theories. 
> 
> Results of Kurt GÃ¶del, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the program, 
> and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. 
> 
> Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets, 
> although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom systems for set theory. 
> 
> Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing 
> which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems 
> (as in reverse mathematics) 
> rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed.
