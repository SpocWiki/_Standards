## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Thomism** is the philosophical and theological school 
> which arose as a legacy of the work and thought of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), 
> the Dominican philosopher, theologian, and Doctor of the Church.
>
> In philosophy, 
> Thomas's disputed questions and commentaries on Aristotle are perhaps his best-known works. 
> 
> In theology, 
> his Summa Theologica is amongst the most influential documents in medieval theology 
> and continues to be the central point of reference 
> for the philosophy and theology of the Catholic Church. 
> 
> In the 1914 motu proprio Doctoris Angelici, Pope Pius X cautioned 
> that the teachings of the Church cannot be understood 
> without the basic philosophical underpinnings of Thomas's major theses: 
>
> The capital theses in the philosophy of St. Thomas 
> are not to be placed in the category of opinions capable of being debated one way or another, 
> but are to be considered as the foundations 
> upon which the whole science of natural and divine things is based; 
> if such principles are once removed or in any way impaired, 
> it must necessarily follow that students of the sacred sciences will ultimately 
> fail to perceive so much as the meaning of the words 
> in which the dogmas of divine revelation are proposed by the magistracy of the Church.
