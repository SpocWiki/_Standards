> **Metaphysic**s is the branch of philosophy that considers the basic structure of reality. 
> It is often characterized as first philosophy, 
> implying that it is more fundamental than other forms of philosophical inquiry. 
> Metaphysics is traditionally seen as the study of mind-independent features of the world, 
> but some modern theorists understand it as 
> an inquiry into the conceptual schemes that underlie human thought and experience.
>
> Many general and abstract topics belong to the subject of metaphysics. 
> It investigates the nature of existence, the features all entities have in common, 
> and their division into categories of being. 
> 
> An influential contrast is between particulars, which are individual unique entities, 
> like a specific apple, and universals, 
> which are general repeatable entities that characterize particulars, like the color red. 
> 
> Modal metaphysics examines what it means for something to be possible or necessary. 
> The nature of space, time, and change is also discussed by metaphysicians. 
> A closely related issue concerns the essence of causality and its relation to the laws of nature. 
> Other topics include how mind and matter are related, 
> whether everything in the world is predetermined, and whether there is free will.
>
> Metaphysicians employ various methods to conduct their inquiry. 
> Traditionally, they rely on rational intuitions and abstract reasoning 
> but have more recently also included empirical approaches associated with scientific theories. 
> 
> Due to the abstract nature of its topic, metaphysics has received criticisms 
> questioning the reliability of its methods and the meaningfulness of its theories. 
> Metaphysics is relevant to many fields of inquiry 
> that often implicitly rely on metaphysical concepts and assumptions.

> The origin of metaphysics lies in antiquity 
> with speculations about the nature of reality and the universe, like those found in 
> - the Upanishads in ancient India, 
> - Daoism in ancient China, and 
> - pre-Socratic philosophy in ancient Greece. 
> 
> The subsequent medieval period in the West discussed 
> the nature of universals as shaped by ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. 
> 
> The modern period saw the emergence of various comprehensive systems of metaphysics, 
> many of which embraced idealism. 
> In the 20th century and contemporary period, a "revolt against idealism" was started, 
> and metaphysics was once declared meaningless, 
> then revived with various criticisms of earlier theories 
> and new approaches to metaphysical inquiry.
