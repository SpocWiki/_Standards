> **Existentialism** is a family of philosophical views and inquiry 
> that explore the human individual's struggle to lead an authentic life 
> despite the apparent absurdity or incomprehensibility of existence. 
> 
> In examining meaning, purpose, and value, 
> existentialist thought often includes concepts such as existential crises, angst, courage, and freedom.
>
> Existentialism is associated with several 19th- and 20th-century European philosophers 
> who shared an emphasis on the human subject, despite often profound differences in thought. 
> Among the 19th-century figures now associated with existentialism 
> are philosophers SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, 
> all of whom critiqued rationalism and concerned themselves with the problem of meaning. 
> 
> The word existentialism, however, was not coined until the mid 20th century, 
> during which it became most associated with contemporaneous philosophers 
> - Jean-Paul Sartre, 
> - Martin Heidegger, 
> - Simone de Beauvoir, 
> - Karl Jaspers, 
> - Gabriel Marcel, 
> - Paul Tillich, 
> - and more controversially Albert Camus. 
>
> Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, 
> to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience. 
> A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity. 
> Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of philosophy, 
> including theology, drama, art, literature, and psychology.
>
> Existentialist philosophy encompasses a range of perspectives, but it shares certain underlying concepts. 
> Among these, a central tenet of existentialism is that personal freedom, individual responsibility, 
> and deliberate choice are essential to the pursuit of self-discovery and the determination of life's meaning.
