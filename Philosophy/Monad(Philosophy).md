> The term **Monad** (from Ancient Greek  μονάς (monas) 'unity', and  μόνος (monos) 'alone') 
> is used in some cosmic philosophy and cosmogony to refer to a most basic or original substance. 
> As originally conceived by the Pythagoreans, the Monad is the Supreme Being, divinity 
> or the totality of all things. 
> 
> According to some philosophers of the early modern period, most notably Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 
> there are infinite monads, which are the basic and immaterial elementary particles, 
> or simplest units, that make up the universe.
