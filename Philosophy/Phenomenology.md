## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Phenomenology is a philosophical study and movement 
> largely associated with the early 20th century 
> that seeks to objectively investigate the nature of subjective, conscious experience 
> and world-disclosure. 
> 
> It attempts to describe the universal features of consciousness 
> while avoiding assumptions about the external world, 
> aiming to describe phenomena as they appear, 
> and to explore the meaning and significance of lived experience.
>
> This approach, while philosophical, 
> has found many applications in qualitative research across different scientific disciplines, 
> especially in the social sciences, humanities, psychology, and cognitive science, 
> but also in fields as diverse as health sciences, architecture, 
> and human-computer interaction, among many others. 
> 
> The application of phenomenology in these fields 
> aims to gain a deeper understanding of subjective experience, 
> rather than focusing on behavior.
>
> Phenomenology is contrasted with phenomenalism, 
> which reduces mental states and physical objects to complexes of sensations, 
> and with psychologism, which treats logical truths or epistemological principles 
> as the products of human psychology. 
> 
> In particular, transcendental phenomenology, as outlined by Edmund Husserl, 
> aims to arrive at an objective understanding of the world 
> via the discovery of universal logical structures in human subjective experience.
>
> There are important differences 
> in the ways that different branches of phenomenology approach subjectivity. 
> 
> For example, according to Martin Heidegger, truths are contextually situated and dependent on the historical, cultural, and social context in which they emerge. Other types include hermeneutic, genetic, and embodied phenomenology. All these different branches of phenomenology may be seen as representing different philosophies despite sharing the common foundational approach of phenomenological inquiry; that is, investigating things just as they appear, independent of any particular theoretical framework.
