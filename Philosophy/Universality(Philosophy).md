> Universalism is the philosophical and theological concept 
> that some ideas have universal application or applicability.
>
> A belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in universalism. The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. A community that calls itself universalist may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner.
>
> Universalism can also mean the pursuit of unification of all human beings across geographic and other boundaries under Western values, or the application of Western universal or universalist constructs, such as human rights or international law.
>
> Universalism has had an influence on modern-day Hinduism, in turn influencing modern Western spirituality.
>
> Christian universalism refers to the idea that every human will eventually receive salvation in a religious or spiritual sense, a concept also referred to as universal reconciliation.
