## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The I Ching or Yijing (Chinese: 易經 Mandarin pronunciation:[î tɕíŋ] ), 
> usually translated Book of Changes or Classic of Changes, 
> is an ancient Chinese divination text that is among the oldest of the Chinese classics. 
> 
> The I Ching was originally a divination manual in the Western Zhou period (1000–750 BC). 
> Over the course of the Warring States and early imperial periods (500–200 BC), 
> it transformed into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries 
> known as the Ten Wings. 
> 
> After becoming part of the Chinese Five Classics in the 2nd century BC, 
> the I Ching was the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East 
> and was the subject of scholarly commentary. 
> 
> Between the 18th and 20th centuries, it took on an influential role 
> in Western understanding of East Asian philosophical thought.
>
> As a divination text, the I Ching is used for a Chinese form of 
> cleromancy known as I Ching divination in which bundles of yarrow stalks are 
> manipulated to produce sets of six apparently random numbers ranging from 6 to 9. 
> 
> Each of the 2^6 = 64 possible sets corresponds to a hexagram, 
> which can be looked up in the I Ching. 
> 
> The hexagrams are arranged in an 8x8 order known as the King Wen sequence. 
> The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching 
> has been discussed and debated over the centuries. 
> 
> Many commentators have used the book symbolically, 
> often to provide guidance for moral decision-making, 
> as informed by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. 
> 
> The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance 
> and been paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wuxing.
