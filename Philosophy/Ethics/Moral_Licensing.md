> Self-licensing (also moral self-licensing, moral licensing, or licensing effect) 
> is a term used in social psychology and marketing 
> to describe the subconscious phenomenon 
> whereby increased confidence and security in one's self-image or self-concept 
> tends to make that individual worry less 
> about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior 
> and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally. 
> 
> In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge 
> after doing something positive first; for example, 
> drinking a diet soda with a greasy hamburger and fries 
> can lead one to subconsciously discount the negative attributes 
> of the meal's high caloric and cholesterol content.
>
> A large subset of this effect, the moral credential effect, 
> is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian 
> establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license 
> that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. 
> 
> This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. 
> For example, individuals who had the opportunity 
> to recruit a woman or Black person in one setting 
> were more likely to say later, in a different setting, 
> that a job would be better suited for a man or a white person. 
> 
> Similar effects also appear to occur 
> when a person observes another person from a group they identify with 
> making an egalitarian decision.
>
> Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences 
> since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, 
> selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
>
> But recent scholarship has failed to replicate seminal studies of the licensing effect, 
> and meta-analysis found it to be exaggerated by publication bias. 
> 
> Furthermore, where licensing typically assumes that a good deed is the cause that makes subsequent transgressions more likely, 
> an alternative (or additional) account is 
> that people are faced with a temptation to do something morally dubious, 
> and use a prior good deed as an excuse or reason why it is allowed for them to indulge.
