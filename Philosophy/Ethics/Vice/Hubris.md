> **Hubris** (from Ancient Greek  ὕβρις (húbris) 'pride, insolence, outrage'), or less frequently hybris, is extreme or excessive pride or dangerous overconfidence and complacency, often in combination with (or synonymous with) arrogance.
>
> Hubris, arrogance, and pretension are related to the need for victory (even if it does not always mean winning) instead of reconciliation, which "friendly" groups might promote. Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from wrongful acts. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments, or capabilities.
>
> The term hubris originated in Ancient Greek, where it had several different meanings depending on the context. In legal usage, it meant assault or sexual crimes and theft of public property, and in religious usage it meant emulation of divinity or transgression against a god.
