## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Vanity** is the 
> excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness compared to others. 
> 
> Prior to the 14th century, it did not have such narcissistic undertones, 
> and **merely meant futility**. 
> 
> The related term vainglory is now often seen as an archaic synonym for vanity, 
> but originally meant considering one's own capabilities 
> and that God's help was not needed, i.e. unjustified boasting; 
> although glory is now seen as having a predominantly positive meaning, 
> the Latin term from which it derives, **gloria, roughly means boasting**, 
> and was often used as a negative criticism.
