## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one would want to be treated by them. 
> It is sometimes called an ethics of reciprocity, meaning that one should reciprocate to others 
> how one would like them to treat the person (not necessarily how they actually treat them). 
> 
> Various expressions of this rule can be found in the tenets of 
> most religions and creeds through the ages.
>
> The maxim may appear as a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:
> - Treat others as one would like others to treat them (positive or directive form)
> - Do not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form)
> - What one wishes upon others, they wish upon themselves (empathetic or responsive form)
