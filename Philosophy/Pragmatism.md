Pragmatism, as a philosophical movement, was primarily developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, 
an American philosopher, logician, and scientist. 
He is often credited with founding pragmatism due to his early and influential work in the field. 
Peirce's development of pragmatism centered around the idea that 
the meaning of any concept or proposition lies in its practical effects and implications.


According to [[../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematician/Peirce,Charles_Sanders|Peirce,Charles_Sanders]], 
[[objective]] Reality can be described 
using [[intersubjective]] Terms 
by resolving Differences in the [[subjective]] Experience of Reality. 
This Process is also known as [[Social_Rationality]].  

Additionally, Peirce short-cut many philosophical  Discussions 
by focusing on the actual Consequences of it, instead of discussing metaphysical Questions. 

### Key Figures in the Development of Pragmatism

1. **Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914)**:
   - **Contribution**: Peirce introduced the concept of pragmatism in the 1870s. He argued that the meaning of ideas and concepts should be understood in terms of their practical consequences.
   - **Works**: His seminal work includes the paper "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" (1878), where he outlined the pragmatic maxim.

2. **William James (1842–1910)**:
   - **Contribution**: William James popularized pragmatism and expanded on Peirce's ideas. 
     He emphasized the practical applications of philosophical concepts and their effects on human experience.
   - **Works**: His book "Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking" (1907) was crucial in spreading pragmatist ideas.

3. **John Dewey (1859–1952)**:
   - **Contribution**: Dewey further developed pragmatism into a comprehensive philosophy 
     encompassing education, ethics, and social theory. 
     He stressed the importance of experience and experimental inquiry.
   - **Works**: Dewey's influential books include "Democracy and Education" (1916) and "Experience and Nature" (1925).

### Summary of Contributions

- **Charles Sanders Peirce**: Founded pragmatism, introduced the pragmatic maxim.
- **William James**: Popularized and expanded pragmatism, emphasizing practical applications.
- **John Dewey**: Developed pragmatism into a broader philosophy, focusing on experience and inquiry.

### Core Principles of Pragmatism

- **Practical Consequences**: The meaning and truth of concepts are determined by their practical effects and applications.
- **Experience and Experimentation**: Knowledge is derived from experience and tested through practical experimentation.
- **Anti-Absolutism**: Pragmatism rejects absolute truths, focusing instead on concepts that work in practice and can be adapted over time.

By integrating these principles, pragmatism became a distinctive and influential philosophical movement, emphasizing the importance of action and practical consequences in the development of ideas.
