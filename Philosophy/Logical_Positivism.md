> Logical positivism, also known as logical empiricism or neo-positivism, 
> was a philosophical movement, in the empiricist tradition, 
> that sought to formulate a scientific philosophy in which philosophical discourse would be, 
> in the perception of its proponents, as authoritative and meaningful as empirical science.
>
> Logical positivism's central thesis was the verification principle, 
> also known as the "verifiability criterion of meaning", 
> according to which a statement is cognitively meaningful 
> **only if it can be verified through empirical observation** or if it is a tautology 
> (true by virtue of its own meaning or its own logical form). 
> 
> The verifiability criterion thus rejected statements of metaphysics, theology, ethics and aesthetics 
> as cognitively meaningless in terms of truth value or factual content. 
> Despite its ambition to overhaul philosophy by mimicking the structure and process of empirical science, 
> logical positivism became erroneously stereotyped as an agenda to regulate the scientific process 
> and to place strict standards on it.
>
> The movement emerged in the late 1920s among philosophers, scientists and mathematicians 
> congregated within the Vienna Circle and Berlin Circle 
> and flourished in several European centres through the 1930s. 
> By the end of World War II, many of its members had settled in the English-speaking world 
> and the project shifted to less radical goals within the philosophy of science.
>
> By the 1950s, problems identified within logical positivism's central tenets became seen as intractable, 
> drawing escalating criticism among leading philosophers, 
> notably from Willard van Orman Quine and Karl Popper, 
> and even from within the movement, from Carl Hempel. 
> 
> These problems would remain unresolved, 
> precipitating the movement's eventual decline and abandonment by the 1960s. 
> 
> In 1967, philosopher John Passmore pronounced logical positivism "dead, 
> or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes".
