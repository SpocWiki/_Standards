## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Michel de Nostredame (December 1503 – July 1566), usually Latinised as **Nostradamus**, 
> was a French astrologer, apothecary, physician, and reputed seer, 
> who is best known for his book Les Prophéties (published in 1555), 
> a collection of 942 poetic quatrains allegedly predicting future events.
>
> Nostradamus's father's family had originally been Jewish, 
> but had converted to Catholic Christianity a generation before Nostradamus was born. 
> 
> He studied at the University of Avignon, but was forced to leave after just over a year 
> when the university closed due to an outbreak of the plague. 
> 
> He worked as an apothecary for several years before entering the University of Montpellier, 
> hoping to earn a doctorate, but was almost immediately expelled 
> after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. 
> 
> He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 
> during another plague outbreak. 
> 
> He worked against the plague alongside other doctors before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, 
> with whom he had six children. 
> 
> He wrote an almanac for 1550 and, as a result of its success, 
> continued writing them for future years 
> as he began working as an astrologer for various wealthy patrons. 
> 
> Catherine de' Medici became one of his foremost supporters. 
> His Les Prophéties, published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary precedent, 
> and initially received mixed reception. 
> 
> He suffered from severe gout toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into edema. 
> He died on 1 or 2 July 1566. 
> 
> Many popular authors have retold apocryphal legends about his life.
>
> In the years since the publication of his Les Prophéties, 
> Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with some of the popular press, 
> credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events. 
> 
> Academic sources reject the notion 
> that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities 
> and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains 
> are the result of (sometimes deliberate) misinterpretations or mistranslations. 
> 
> These academics also argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, 
> meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, 
> and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers.
