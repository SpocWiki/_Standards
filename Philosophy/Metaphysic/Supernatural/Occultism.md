> The term **Occultism** emerged in 19th-century France, 
> among figures such as Antoine Court de Gébelin. 
> It came to be associated with various French esoteric groups 
> connected to Éliphas Lévi and Papus, 
> and in 1875 was introduced into the English language by the esotericist Helena Blavatsky.

> Throughout the 20th century, the term 'occult' was used idiosyncratically by a range of different authors. By the 21st century the term 'occultism' was commonly employed –including by academic scholars in the field of Western esotericism studies– to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. Occultism is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as Qabalah, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Wicca, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, New Age, Thelema and the left-hand path and right-hand path.

> While Rosicrucianism is not directly 'occult', various Christian Rosicrucian societies have also engaged in esoteric study and are historically adjacent; for example, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia and it's members influenced the foundation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
>
> Use of the term as a nominalized adjective ('the occult') has developed especially since the late twentieth century. In that same period, occult and culture were combined to form the neologism occulture.
