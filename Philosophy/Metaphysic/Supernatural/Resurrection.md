## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Resurrection** or anastasis is the concept of coming back to life after death. 
> Reincarnation is a similar process hypothesized by other religions involving the same person or deity returning to another body. The disappearance of a body is another similar but distinct belief in some religions.
>
> With the advent of written records, the earliest known recurrent theme of resurrection was in Egyptian and Canaanite religions, which had cults of dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Ancient Greek religion generally emphasised immortality, but in the mythos, a number of individuals were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead.
>
> The universal resurrection of the dead at the end of the world is a standard eschatological belief in the Abrahamic religions. As a religious concept, resurrection is used in two distinct respects:
>
> 
>
> a belief in the individual resurrections of individual souls that is current and ongoing (e.g., Christian idealism, realized eschatology),
>
> a general bodily universal resurrection of all of the dead at the end of the world. Some believe the soul is the actual vehicle by which people are resurrected.
>
> The death and resurrection of Jesus are a central focus of Christianity. While most Christians believe Jesus's resurrection from the dead and ascension to Heaven was in a material body, some think it was only spiritual.
>
> Like some forms of the Abrahamic religions, the Dharmic religions also include belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation. There are stories in Buddhism wherein the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in the Chan or Zen tradition. In Hinduism, the core belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation is known as saṃsāra.
>
> Aside from religious belief, cryonics and other speculative resurrection technologies are practiced, but the resurrection of long-dead bodies is not considered possible at the current level of scientific knowledge.
