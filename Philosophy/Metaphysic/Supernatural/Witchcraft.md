> **Witchcraft** is the use of magic by a person called a witch. 
> 
> Traditionally, "witchcraft" means the use of magic 
> to inflict supernatural harm or misfortune on others, 
> and this remains the most common and widespread meaning. 
> 
> Though the idea of witchcraft is largely imaginary, 
> it has nevertheless served in many cultures as a way to explain the presence of evil. 
> 
> The belief in witches has been found throughout history in a great number of societies worldwide. 
> Most of these societies have used protective magic or counter-magic against witchcraft, 
> and have shunned, banished, imprisoned, physically punished or killed alleged witches. 
> 
> Anthropologists use the term "witchcraft" 
> for similar beliefs about harmful occult practices in different cultures, 
> and these societies often use the term when speaking in English.
>
> Belief in witchcraft as malevolent magic is attested from ancient Mesopotamia, 
> and in Europe, belief in witches traces back to classical antiquity. 
> 
> In medieval and early modern Europe, accused witches 
> were usually women who were believed to have secretly used black magic (maleficium) 
> against their own community. 
> 
> Usually, accusations of witchcraft were made by neighbors of accused witches, 
> and followed from social tensions. 
> 
> Witches were sometimes said to have communed with demons or with the Devil, 
> though such accusations were mainly made against perceived opponents of the Church. 
> 
> It was thought witchcraft could be thwarted by white magic, 
> provided by 'cunning folk' or 'wise people'. 
> 
> Suspected witches were often prosecuted 
> and punished, if found guilty or simply believed to be guilty. 
> European witch-hunts and witch trials in the early modern period 
> led to tens of thousands of executions. 
> 
> While magical healers and midwives were sometimes accused of witchcraft, 
> they made up a minority of those accused.  
> European belief in witchcraft gradually dwindled 
> during and after the Age of Enlightenment.
>
> Many indigenous belief systems that include the concept of witchcraft 
> likewise define witches as malevolent, 
> and seek healers (such as medicine people and witch doctors) 
> to ward off and undo bewitchment. 
> 
> Some African and Melanesian peoples 
> believe witches are driven by an evil spirit or substance inside them. 
> Modern witch-hunting takes place in parts of Africa and Asia.
>
> Since the 1930s, followers of certain kinds of modern paganism identify as witches 
> and redefine the term "witchcraft" as part of their neopagan beliefs and practices. 
> 
> Other neo-pagans avoid the term due to its negative connotations.
