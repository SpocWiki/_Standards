## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Nirvana**, in the Indian religions (Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism), 
> is the concept of an individual's passions being extinguished 
> as the ultimate state of salvation, release, or liberation from suffering (duḥkha) 
> and from the cycle of birth and rebirth (saṃsāra).
>
> In Indian religions, nirvana is sometimes used as a synonym of moksha and mukti. 
> All Indian religions assert it to be a state of perfect quietude, freedom, and highest happiness; liberation from attachment and worldly suffering; 
> and the ending of samsara, the cycle of existence. 
> 
> However, non-Buddhist and Buddhist traditions describe these terms for liberation differently. 
> 
> In Hindu philosophy, it is the union of or the realization of 
> the identity of Atman with Brahman, depending on the Hindu tradition. 
> 
> In Jainism, nirvana is also the soteriological goal, 
> representing the release of a soul from karmic bondage and samsara. 
> 
> The Buddhist concept of nirvana is the abandonment of the 10 fetters, 
> marking the end of rebirth by stilling the "fires" that keep the process of rebirth going.
