> A **Goddess** is a female deity. 
> In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. 
> For example, Shaktism (one of the three major Hindu sects), holds that 
> the ultimate deity, the source of all reality, is Supreme Goddess (Mahaiia) 
> and in some forms of Tantric Shaivism, the pair of Shiva and Shakti are the ultimate principle 
> (with the goddess representing the active, creative power of God). 
> 
> Meanwhile, in Vajrayana Buddhism, ultimate reality is often seen 
> as being composed of two principles depicted as two deities in union (yab yum, "father-mother") 
> symbolising the non-duality of the two principles of perfect wisdom (female) and skillful compassion (male). 
> 
> A single figure in a monotheistic faith that is female may be identified simply as god 
> because of no need to differentiate by gender or with a diminutive. 
> An experiment to determine the effect of psychedelics on subjects 
> composed of leaders from diverse religious groups revealed a general experience 
> that the divine the subjects encountered was feminine.
>
> Polytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honour multiple goddesses and gods, 
> and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. 
> These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities. 
> 
> In many known cultures, goddesses are often linked with literal or metaphorical pregnancy 
> or imagined feminine roles associated with how women and girls are perceived or expected to behave. 
> 
> This includes themes of spinning, weaving, beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, domesticity, creativity, 
> and fertility (exemplified by the ancient mother goddess cult). 
> 
> Many major goddesses are also associated with magic, war, strategy, hunting, 
> farming, wisdom, fate, earth, sky, power, laws, justice, and more. 
> 
> Some themes, such as discord or disease, which are considered 
> negative within their cultural contexts also are found associated with some goddesses. 
> There are as many differently described and understood goddesses 
> as there are male, shapeshifting, devilish, or neuter gods.
