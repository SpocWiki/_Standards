## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A mother goddess is a major goddess characterized as a mother or progenitor, 
> either as an embodiment of motherhood and fertility 
> or fulfilling the cosmological role of a creator- and/or destroyer-figure, 
> typically associated the Earth, sky, and/or the life-giving bounties thereof 
> in a maternal relation with humanity or other gods. 
> 
> When equated in this lattermost function with the earth or the natural world, 
> such goddesses are sometimes referred to as the Mother Earth or Earth Mother, 
> deity in various animistic or pantheistic religions.  
> 
> The earth goddess is archetypally the wife 
> or feminine counterpart of the Sky Father or Father Heaven, 
> particularly in theologies derived from the Proto-Indo-European sphere (i.e. from Dheghom and Dyeus). 
> 
> In some polytheistic cultures, such as the Ancient Egyptian religion 
> which narrates the cosmic egg myth, 
> the sky is instead seen as the Heavenly Mother or Sky Mother as in Nut and Hathor, 
> and the earth god is regarded as the male, paternal, and terrestrial partner, 
> as in Osiris or Geb who hatched out of the maternal cosmic egg.
