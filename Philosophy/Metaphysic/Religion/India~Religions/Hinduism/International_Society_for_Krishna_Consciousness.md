## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), 
> commonly known as the Hare Krishna Movement, is a Hindu religious organization. 
> It follows the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, 
> which emphasizes devotion (bhakti) to Krishna as the supreme deity. 
> The ISKCON was founded on 13 July 1966 in New York City by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. 
> The organization's spiritual and administrative headquarters is located in Mayapur, West Bengal, India, 
> and it claims a global membership of around one million people.
>
> ISKCON teaches a form of panentheistic Hinduism rooted in the Bhagavad Gita, 
> the Bhagavata Purana, and other scriptures, interpreted through the commentaries of its founder. Although commonly regarded as monotheistic by the general public, ISKCON theology emphasizes that the Supreme Being, Krishna, manifests in multiple forms while remaining the singular, ultimate reality. The movement is described as the largest and most influential branch of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, which originated in India in the early 16th century and expanded internationally during the late 20th century.
>
> ISKCON promotes bhakti yoga—the path of devotional service to Krishna—as the central spiritual practice of its members, who are often referred to as "bhaktas." The movement also encourages lacto vegetarianism, regular chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra, and strict ethical and devotional disciplines as part of its teachings on spiritual progress.
