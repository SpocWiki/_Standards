> **Proto-Indo-European mythology** 
> is the body of myths and deities associated with the Proto-Indo-Europeans, 
> speakers of the hypothesized Proto-Indo-European language. 
> 
> Although the mythological motifs are not directly attested – 
> since Proto-Indo-European speakers lived in preliterate societies – 
> scholars of comparative mythology have reconstructed details 
> from inherited similarities in mythological concepts found in Indo-European languages, 
> based on the assumption that parts of the Proto-Indo-Europeans' original belief systems 
> survived in the daughter traditions.
>
> The Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes a number of securely reconstructed deities, 
> since they are both cognates—linguistic siblings from a common origin—
> and associated with similar attributes and body of myths: such as 
> - \*Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr, the daylight-sky god; 
> - his consort \*Dʰéǵʰōm, the earth mother; 
> - his daughter \*H₂éwsōs, the dawn goddess; 
> - his sons the Divine Twins; 
> - and \*Seh₂ul and \*Meh₁not, a solar deity and moon deity, respectively. 
> - 
> - Some deities, like the weather god \*Perkʷunos or the herding-god \*Péh₂usōn, 
> - are only attested in a limited number of traditions—
> - Western (i.e. European) and Graeco-Aryan, respectively—
> - and could therefore represent late additions that did not spread throughout the various Indo-European dialects.
>
> Some myths are also securely dated to Proto-Indo-European times, 
> since they feature both linguistic and thematic evidence of an inherited motif: 
> a story portraying a mythical figure associated with thunder 
> and slaying a multi-headed serpent 
> to release torrents of water that had previously been pent up; 
> a creation myth involving two brothers, 
> one of whom sacrifices the other in order to create the world; 
> and probably the belief that the Otherworld was guarded by a watchdog 
> and could only be reached by crossing a river.
>
> Various schools of thought exist regarding 
> possible interpretations of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European mythology. 
> 
> The main mythologies used in comparative reconstruction are 
> - Indo-Iranian, 
> - Baltic, 
> - Roman, 
> - Norse, 
> - Celtic, 
> - Greek, 
> - Slavic, 
> - Hittite, 
> - Armenian, and 
> - Albanian.
