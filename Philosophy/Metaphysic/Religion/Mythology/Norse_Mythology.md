## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Norse, Nordic, or Scandinavian mythology, 
> is the body of myths belonging to the North Germanic peoples, 
> stemming from Old Norse religion 
> and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia 
> as the Nordic folklore of the modern period. 
> 
> The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology 
> and stemming from Proto-Germanic folklore, 
> **Norse mythology** consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes 
> derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, 
> including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition. 
> 
> The source texts mention numerous gods such as the thunder-god Thor, 
> the raven-flanked god Odin, the goddess Freyja, and numerous other deities.
>
> Most of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods 
> and their interaction with several other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, 
> beings who may be friends, lovers, foes, or family members of the gods. 
> 
> The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds 
> that flank a central sacred tree, Yggdrasil. 
> 
> Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. 
> Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. 
> 
> These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnarök 
> when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, 
> and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. 
> 
> There the surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, 
> and two humans will repopulate the world.
>
> Norse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century 
> when key texts attracted the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe. 
> 
> By way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics, 
> scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology 
> reaching as far back as [[Proto-Indo-European_Mythology]]. 
> 
> During the modern period, the Romanticist Viking revival 
> re-awoke an interest in the subject matter, 
> and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture. 
> 
> The myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of Germanic Neopaganism.
