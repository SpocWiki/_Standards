> King Arthur (Welsh: Brenin Arthur; Cornish: Arthur Gernow; Breton: Roue Arzhur; French: Roi Arthur) was a legendary king of Britain. 
> He is a folk hero and a central figure in the medieval literary tradition 
> known as the Matter of Britain.
>
> In Welsh sources, Arthur is portrayed as a leader of the post-Roman Britons 
> in battles against the Anglo-Saxons in the late-5th and early-6th centuries. 
> 
> He first appears in two early medieval historical sources, 
> the Annales Cambriae and the Historia Brittonum, 
> but these date to 300 years after he is supposed to have lived, 
> and most historians who study the period do not consider him a historical figure. 
> 
> His name also occurs in early Welsh poetic sources, such as Y Gododdin. 
> The character developed through Welsh mythology, appearing either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, and was sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn.
>
> The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest 
> largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 
> 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). 
> 
> Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons 
> and established a vast empire. 
> 
> Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story 
> appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, 
> Arthur's wife Guinevere, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's conception at Tintagel, 
> his final battle against Mordred at Camlann, and his final rest in Avalon. 
> 
> ChrÃ©tien de Troyes, 
> the 12th-century French writer who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, 
> began the genre of Arthurian romance, 
> which in turn became a significant strand of medieval literature. 
> 
> In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself 
> to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. 
> The themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend vary widely from text to text, 
> and there is no one canonical version. 
> 
> Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the following centuries 
> until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. 
> In the 21st century the legend continues to have prominence, 
> not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.
