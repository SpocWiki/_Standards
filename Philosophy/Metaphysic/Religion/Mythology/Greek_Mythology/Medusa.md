> In Greek mythology, **Medusa** (Ancient Greek: Μέδουσα, romanized: Médousa, lit. 'guardian, protectress'), 
> also called Gorgo (Ancient Greek: Γοργώ) or the Gorgon, was one of the three Gorgons. 
> 
> Medusa is generally described as a woman with living snakes in place of hair; 
> her appearance was so hideous that anyone who looked upon her was turned to stone. 
> 
> Medusa and her Gorgon sisters Euryale and Stheno were usually described as 
> daughters of Phorcys and Ceto; of the three, only Medusa was mortal.
>
> Medusa was beheaded by the Greek hero Perseus, who then used her head, 
> which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon 
> until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield. 
> 
> In classical antiquity, the image of the head of Medusa appeared in 
> the evil-averting device known as the Gorgoneion.
>
> According to Hesiod and Aeschylus, she lived and died on Sarpedon, somewhere near Cisthene. 
> The 2nd-century BC novelist Dionysios Skytobrachion puts her somewhere in Libya, 
> where Herodotus had said the Berbers originated her myth as part of their religion.
