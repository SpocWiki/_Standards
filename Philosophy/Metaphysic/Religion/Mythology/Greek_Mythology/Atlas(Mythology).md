> In Greek mythology, Atlas (; Ancient Greek: Ἄτλας, Átlās) is a Titan 
> condemned to hold up the heavens or sky for eternity after the Titanomachy. 
> 
> Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest Greek heroes: 
> Heracles (Hercules in Roman mythology) and Perseus. 
> 
> According to the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in the extreme west. 
> Later, he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa 
> and was said to be the first King of Mauretania (modern-day Morocco and west Algeria, 
> not to be confused with the modern-day country of Mauritania). 
> 
> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. 
> In antiquity, he was credited with inventing the first celestial sphere. 
> In some texts, he is even credited with the invention of astronomy itself.
>
> Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Asia or Clymene. 
> He was a brother of Epimetheus and Prometheus. 
> He had many children, mostly daughters, the Hesperides, the Hyades, the Pleiades, 
> and the nymph Calypso who lived on the island Ogygia.
>
> Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator characterized Atlas as the founder of geography, 
> leading to the modern sense of the term "atlas" for a collection of maps 
> after Mercator published his own work in honor of the Titan.
>
> The "Atlantic Ocean" is derived from "Sea of Atlas". 
> The name of Atlantis mentioned in Plato's Timaeus' dialogue derives from "Atlantis nesos" 
> (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος), literally meaning "Atlas' Island".
