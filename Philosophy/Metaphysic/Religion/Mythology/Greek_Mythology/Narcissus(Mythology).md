## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In Greek mythology, Narcissus (Ancient Greek: Νάρκισσος, romanized: Nárkissos) 
> is a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia (alternatively Mimas or modern-day Karaburun, İzmir), 
> known for his beauty which was noticed by all. 
> 
> According to the best-known version of the story in Ovid's Metamorphoses, 
> Narcissus rejected the advances of all women and men who approached him, 
> instead falling in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. 
> 
> In some versions, he beat his breast purple in agony 
> at being kept apart from this reflected love, 
> and in his place sprouted a flower bearing his name.
>
> The character of Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism, 
> a self-centered personality style. 
> 
> This quality in extreme contributes to the definition of narcissistic personality disorder, 
> a psychiatric condition marked by grandiosity, excessive need for attention and admiration, 
> and an impaired ability to empathize.
