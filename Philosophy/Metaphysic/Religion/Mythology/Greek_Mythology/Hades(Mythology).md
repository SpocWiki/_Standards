> **Hades** (; Ancient Greek: ᾍδης, romanized: Hā́idēs, Attic Greek: [háːi̯dεːs], later [háːdeːs]), 
> in the ancient Greek religion and mythology, is the God of the dead and riches 
> and the King of the underworld, with which his name became synonymous. 
> 
> Hades was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, 
> although this also made him the last son to be regurgitated by his father. 
> 
> He and his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon, defeated, overthrew, 
> and replaced their father's generation of gods, the Titans, 
> and claimed joint sovereignty over the cosmos. 
> 
> Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, and Poseidon the sea, 
> with the solid earth, which was long the domain of Gaia, available to all three concurrently. 
> In artistic depictions, Hades is typically portrayed holding a bident and wearing his helm 
> with Cerberus, the  three-headed  guard-dog of the underworld, standing at his side.
>
> Roman-era mythographers eventually equated the Etruscan god Aita,
> and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus, with Hades, and merged all these figures into Pluto, 
> a Latinisation of Plouton (Ancient Greek: Πλούτων, romanized: Ploútōn), 
> itself a euphemistic title (meaning "the rich one") often given to Hades.
