## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In ancient Greek religion and mythology, **Artemis** (; Ancient Greek: Ἄρτεμις) is the goddess of the hunt, 
> the wilderness, wild animals, transitions, nature, vegetation, childbirth, care of children, and chastity. 
> 
> In later times, she was identified with Selene, the personification of the Moon. 
> She was often said to roam the forests and mountains, attended by her entourage of nymphs. 
> The goddess Diana is her Roman equivalent.
>
> In Greek tradition, Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and twin sister of Apollo. 
> In most accounts, the twins are the products of an extramarital liaison. 
> For this, Zeus' wife Hera forbade Leto from giving birth anywhere on solid land. 
> Only the island of Delos gave refuge to Leto, allowing her to give birth to her children. 
> In one account, Artemis is born first and then proceeds to assist Leto in the birth of the second twin, Apollo. 
>
> Artemis was a kourotrophic (child-nurturing) deity, 
> being the patron and protector of young children, especially young girls. 
> Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery 
> along with Eileithyia and Hera. 
> She was also a patron of healing and disease, particularly among women and children, 
> and believed to send both good health and illness upon women and children. 
> Artemis was one of the three major virgin goddesses, alongside Athena and Hestia. 
> Artemis preferred to remain an unmarried maiden 
> and was one of the three Greek goddesses over whom Aphrodite had no power.
>
> In myth and literature, Artemis is presented as a hunting goddess of the woods, surrounded by her chaste band of nymphs. In the myth of Actaeon, when the young hunter sees her bathing naked, he is transformed into a deer by the angered goddess and is then devoured by his own hunting dogs, who do not recognize their master. In the story of Callisto, the girl is driven away from Artemis' company after breaking her vow of virginity, having lain with and been impregnated by Zeus. In the Epic tradition, Artemis halted the winds blowing the Greek ships during the Trojan War, stranding the Greek fleet in Aulis, after King Agamemnon, the leader of the expedition, shot and killed her sacred deer. Artemis demanded the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Agamemnon's young daughter, as compensation for her slain deer. In most versions, when Iphigenia is led to the altar to be offered as a sacrifice, Artemis pities her and takes her away, leaving a deer in her place. In the war that followed, Artemis supported the Trojans against the Greeks, and she challenged Hera in battle.
>
> Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities; her worship spread throughout ancient Greece, with her multiple temples, altars, shrines, and local veneration found everywhere in the ancient world. Her great temple at Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, before it was burnt to the ground. Artemis' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver, and hunting knives, and the deer and the cypress were sacred to her. Diana, her Roman equivalent, was especially worshipped on the Aventine Hill in Rome, near Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills, and in Campania.
