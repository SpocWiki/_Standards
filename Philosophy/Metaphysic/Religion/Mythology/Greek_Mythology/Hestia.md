## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In ancient Greek religion and mythology, **Hestia** (Ancient Greek: Ἑστία, lit. 'hearth, fireplace, altar') 
> is the virgin goddess of the hearth and the home. 
> In myth, she is the firstborn child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, and one of the Twelve Olympians.
>
> In Greek mythology, newborn Hestia, along with four of her five siblings, 
> was devoured by her father Cronus, who feared being overthrown by one of his offspring. 
> 
> Zeus, the youngest child, escaped with his mother's help, and made his father disgorge all his siblings. 
> Cronus was supplanted by this new generation of deities; 
> and Hestia thus became one of the Olympian gods, the new rulers of the cosmos, 
> alongside her brothers and sisters. 
> In spite of her status, she has little prominence in Greek mythology. 
> Like Athena and Artemis, Hestia elected never to marry and remained an eternal virgin goddess instead, 
> forever tending to the hearth of Olympus.
>
> As the goddess of sacrificial fire, Hestia received the first offering at every domestic sacrifice. 
> In the public domain, the hearth of the prytaneum functioned as her official sanctuary. 
> Whenever a new colony was established, 
> a flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement. 
> The goddess Vesta is her Roman equivalent.
