> In Greek mythology, Andromeda (; Ancient Greek: Ἀνδρομέδα, romanized: Androméda or Ἀνδρομέδη, Andromédē) 
> is the daughter of Cepheus, the king of Aethiopia, and his wife, Cassiopeia. 
> 
> When Cassiopeia boasts that she (or Andromeda) is more beautiful than the Nereids, 
> Poseidon sends the sea monster Cetus to ravage the coast of Aethiopia as divine punishment. 
> 
> Queen Cassiopeia understands that chaining Andromeda to a rock as a human sacrifice is what will appease Poseidon. 
> Perseus finds her as he is coming back from his quest to decapitate Medusa, 
> and brings her back to Greece to marry her and let her reign as his queen. 
> With the head of Medusa, Perseus petrifies Cetus to stop it from terrorizing the coast any longer. 
>
> As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical antiquity; rescued by a Greek hero, 
> Andromeda's narration is considered the forerunner to the "princess and dragon" motif. 
> 
> From the Renaissance, interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses. 
> The story has appeared many times in such diverse media as 
> plays, poetry, novels, operas, classical and popular music, film, and paintings. 
> 
> A significant part of the northern sky contains several constellations named after the story's figures; 
> in particular, the constellation Andromeda is named after her.
>
> The Andromeda tradition, from classical antiquity onwards, 
> has incorporated elements of other stories, including Saint George and the Dragon, 
> introducing a horse for the hero, and the tale of Pegasus, Bellerophon's winged horse. 
> 
> Ludovico Ariosto's epic poem Orlando Furioso, which tells a similar story, has introduced further confusion. 
> Patricia Yaker Ekall has critized the tradition of depicting the princess of Aethiopia as white; 
> noting few artists have chosen to portray her as dark-skinned, despite Ovid's account of her. 
> 
> Others have stated that Perseus's liberation of Andromeda was a popular choice of subject among male artists, 
> reinforcing a narrative of male superiority with its powerful male hero and its endangered female in bondage.
