> A **Nymph** (Ancient Greek: νύμφη, romanized: nýmphē; Attic Greek: [nýmpʰɛː]; sometimes spelled nymphe) is a minor female nature deity in ancient Greek folklore. 
> 
> Distinct from other Greek goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature; 
> they are typically tied to a specific place, landform, or tree, and are usually depicted as maidens. 
> 
> Because of their association with springs, they were often seen as having healing properties; 
> other divine powers of the nymphs included divination and shapeshifting. 
> In spite of their divine nature, they were not immortal.
>
> Nymphs are divided into various broad subgroups based on their habitat, such as 
> - the Meliae (ash tree nymphs), 
> - the Dryads (oak tree nymphs), 
> - the Alseids (grove nymphs), 
> - the Naiads (spring nymphs), 
> - the Nereids (sea nymphs), 
> - the Oceanids (ocean nymphs), and 
> - the Oreads (mountain nymphs). 
> Other nymphs included 
> - the Hesperides (evening nymphs), 
> - the Hyades (rain nymphs), and 
> - the Pleiades (companions of Artemis).
>
> Nymphs featured in classic works of art, literature, and mythology. 
> They are often attendants of goddesses and frequently occur in myths with a love motif, 
> being the lovers of heroes and other deities. 
> 
> Desirable and promiscuous, nymphs can rarely be tamed, 
> their dealings with mortals often marked by capricious aggression. 
> 
> Since the Middle Ages, nymphs have been sometimes 
> popularly associated or even confused with fairies.
