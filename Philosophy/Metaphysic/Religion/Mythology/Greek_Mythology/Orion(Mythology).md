> In Greek mythology, Orion (Ancient Greek: Ὠρίων or Ὠαρίων; Latin: Orion) was a giant huntsman 
> whom Zeus (or perhaps Artemis)  placed among the stars as the constellation of Orion.
>
> Ancient sources told several different stories about Orion; 
> there are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. 
> 
> The most important recorded episodes are his birth in Boeotia, 
> his visit to Chios where he met Merope and raped her, being blinded by Merope's father, 
> the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, 
> his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpius, 
> and his elevation to the heavens. 
> 
> Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. 
> These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories, 
> and it is impossible to tell whether the omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.
>
> In Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, 
> where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. 
> The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, 
> but there is no extant literary version of his adventures 
> comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica 
> or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, 
> but that is one version of a single story. 
> The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation 
> about Greek prehistory and myth.
>
> Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. 
> The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one for which there is the most evidence 
> (and even for that, not very much); 
> he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; 
> he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; 
> and there is one etiological passage which says that 
> Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.
