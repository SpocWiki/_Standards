> In Greek mythology, sirens (Ancient Greek: singular: Σειρήν, Seirḗn; plural: Σειρῆνες, Seirênes) 
> are female humanlike beings with alluring voices; 
> they appear in a scene in the Odyssey in which Odysseus saves his crew's lives. 
> 
> Roman poets place them on some small islands called Sirenum Scopuli. 
> In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the "flowery" island of Anthemoessa, 
> or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. 
> All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks. 
> While some versions have depicted Sirens as woman-headed birds, 
> other version depict them as mermaids.
>
> Sirens were used in Christian art throughout the medieval era 
> as a symbol of the dangerous temptation embodied by women. 
> 
> "Siren" can also be used as a slang term for a woman considered both very attractive and dangerous.
