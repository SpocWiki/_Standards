> (ky-MEER-ə, kih-, -⁠MAIR-; Ancient Greek: Χίμαιρα, romanized: Chímaira, lit. 'she-goat') 
> was a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature from Lycia, Asia Minor, 
> composed of different animal parts. 
> 
> Typically, it is depicted as a lion with a goat's head protruding from its back 
> and a tail ending with a snake's head. 
> Some representations also include dragon's wings. 
> It was an offspring of Typhon and Echidna 
> and a sibling of monsters like Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.
>
> The term "chimera" has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature 
> with parts taken from various animals, to describe anything composed of disparate parts 
> or perceived as wildly imaginative, implausible, or dazzling.  
> In other words, a chimera can be any hybrid creature.
>
> In figurative use, derived from the mythological meaning, 
> "chimera" refers to an unrealistic, or unrealisable, wild, foolish or vain dream, notion or objective.
