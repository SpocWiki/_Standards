> In Greek mythology, **Charon** or Kharon (  KAIR-on, -⁠ən; Ancient Greek: Χάρων 
> Ancient Greek pronunciation: [kʰá.rɔːn]) is a psychopomp, 
> the ferryman of the Greek underworld. 
> 
> He carries the souls of those who have been given funeral rites 
> across the rivers Acheron and Styx, which separate the worlds of the living and the dead. 
> 
> Archaeology confirms that, in some burials, 
> low-value coins known generically as Charon's obols 
> were placed in, on, or near the mouth of the deceased, 
> or next to the cremation urn containing their ashes. 
> 
> This has been taken to confirm that at least some aspects of Charon's mytheme 
> are reflected in some Greek and Roman funeral practices, 
> or else the coins function as a viaticum for the soul's journey. 
> 
> In Virgil's epic poem, Aeneid, the dead who could not pay the fee, 
> and those who had received no funeral rites, 
> had to wander the near shores of the Styx for one hundred years 
> before they were allowed to cross the river. 
> 
> Charon also ferried the living mortals Heracles and Aeneas to the underworld and back again.
