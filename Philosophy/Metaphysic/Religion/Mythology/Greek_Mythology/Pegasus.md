> **Pegasus** (Ancient Greek: Πήγασος, romanized: Pḗgasos; Latin: Pegasus, Pegasos) 
> is a winged horse in Greek mythology, usually depicted as a white stallion. 
> 
> He was sired by Poseidon, in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa. 
> Pegasus was the brother of Chrysaor, both born from Medusa's blood 
> when their mother was decapitated by Perseus. 
> 
> Greco-Roman poets wrote about his ascent to heaven after his birth and his obeisance to Zeus, 
> who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus.
>
> Pegasus is the creator of Hippocrene, the fountain on Mount Helicon. 
> He was captured by the Greek hero Bellerophon, near the fountain Peirene, 
> with the help of Athena and Poseidon. 
> 
> Pegasus allowed Bellerophon to ride him in order to defeat the monster Chimera, 
> which led to many more exploits. 
> 
> Bellerophon later fell from Pegasus's back while trying to reach Mount Olympus. 
> Both Pegasus and Bellerophon were said to have died at the hands of Zeus 
> for trying to reach Olympus. 
> Other tales have Zeus bring Pegasus to Olympus to carry his thunderbolts.
>
> Long honored as a constellation, Pegasus is a subject of very rich iconography, 
> especially through ancient Greek pottery as well as paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance.
