> **Jewish mythology** is the body of myths associated with Judaism. 
> Elements of Jewish mythology have had a profound influence on Christian mythology 
> and on Islamic mythology, as well as on Abrahamic culture in general. 
> 
> Christian mythology directly inherited many of the narratives from the Jewish people, 
> sharing in common the narratives from the Old Testament. 
> 
> Islamic mythology also shares many of the same stories; 
> for instance, a creation-account spaced out over six periods, 
> the legend of Abraham, the stories of Moses and the Israelites, and many more.
