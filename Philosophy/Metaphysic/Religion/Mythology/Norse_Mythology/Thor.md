> **Thor** (from Old Norse: Þórr) is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. 
> In Norse mythology, he is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, storms, strength, protection, fertility, farmers, and free people. 
> 
> Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old English as Thunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, 
> in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, 
> all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.
>
> Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, 
> from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, 
> to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, 
> to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, 
> in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia, 
> emblems of his hammer, Mjölnir, were worn 
> and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.
>
> Narratives featuring Thor are most prominently attested in Old Norse, 
> where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology. 
> 
> In stories recorded in medieval Iceland, Thor bears at least fifteen names, 
> is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif and the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa. 
> 
> With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; 
> with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; with a mother whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, 
> and he is the stepfather of the god Ullr. 
> 
> Thor is the son of Odin and Jörð, by way of his father Odin, 
> he has numerous brothers, including Baldr. 
> 
> Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, 
> Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (whom he eats and resurrects), 
> and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). 
> 
> Thor wields the hammer Mjölnir, wears the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, 
> and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. 
> 
> Thor's exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes 
> and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr—
> and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—
> are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.
>
> Into the modern period, Thor continued to be acknowledged 
> in folklore throughout Germanic-speaking Europe. 
> 
> Thor is frequently referred to in place names, 
> the day of the week Thursday bears his name 
> (modern English Thursday derives from Old English thunresdaeġ, 'Thunor's day'), 
> and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, 
> particularly in Scandinavia. 
> 
> Thor has inspired numerous works of art 
> and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. 
> Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry.
