> Inanna is the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of war, love, and fertility. 
> She is also associated with political power, divine law, sensuality, procreation, and beauty. 
> 
> Originally worshipped in Sumer, she was known by the Akkadians, Babylonians, 
> and Assyrians as **Ishtar**. Her primary title is "the Queen of Heaven".
>
> She was the patron goddess of the Eanna temple at the city of Uruk, 
> her early main religious center. 
> 
> In archaic Uruk, she was worshipped in three forms: 
> - morning Inanna (Inana-UD/hud), 
> - evening Inanna (Inanna sig), and 
> - princely Inanna (Inanna NUN), the former two reflecting the phases of her associated planet Venus. 
> 
> Her most prominent symbols include the lion and the eight-pointed star. 
> Her husband is the god Dumuzid (later known as Tammuz), 
> and her sukkal (attendant) is the goddess Ninshubur, 
> later conflated with the male deities Ilabrat and Papsukkal.
>
> Inanna was worshipped in Sumer as early as the Uruk period (c. 4000 – 3100 BCE), 
> and her worship was relatively localized before the conquest of Sargon of Akkad. 
> 
> During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities 
> in the Sumerian pantheon, with temples across Mesopotamia. 
> 
> Adoration of Inanna/Ishtar was continued by the East Semitic-speaking peoples 
> (Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians) 
> who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region.
>
> The Assyrians elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, 
> ranking above their own national god Ashur. 
> 
> Inanna/Ishtar is alluded to in the Hebrew Bible 
> and she greatly influenced the Ugaritic goddess Ashtart 
> and later the Phoenician goddess Astarte, who in turn possibly influenced 
> the development of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. 
> 
> Her worship continued to flourish until its 
> gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries CE in the wake of Christianity.
>
> Inanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity. 
> She also has a uniquely high number of epithets and alternate names, 
> comparable only to Nergal.
>
> Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. 
> She is believed to have been given the mes, 
> which represent all positive and negative aspects of civilization, 
> by Enki, the god of wisdom. 
> 
> She is also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from An, the god of the sky. 
> Alongside her twin brother Utu (later known as Shamash), 
> Inanna is the enforcer of divine justice; 
> she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, 
> unleashed her fury upon the gardener Shukaletuda after he raped her in her sleep, 
> and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in divine retribution 
> for having murdered Dumuzid. 
> 
> In the standard Akkadian version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, 
> Ishtar asks Gilgamesh to become her consort. 
> When he disdainfully refuses, she unleashes the Bull of Heaven, 
> resulting in the death of Enkidu and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his own mortality.
>
> Inanna's most famous myth is the story of her descent into 
> and return from the ancient Mesopotamian underworld, 
> ruled by her older sister Ereshkigal. 
> 
> After she reaches Ereshkigal's throne room, 
> the seven judges of the underworld deem her guilty and strike her dead. 
> Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back. 
> All of them refuse her, except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna.
> They escort Inanna out of the underworld but the galla, 
> the guardians of the underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the underworld 
> as her replacement. 
> 
> Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year, 
> while his sister Geshtinanna remains in the underworld for the other half, 
> resulting in the cycle of the seasons.
