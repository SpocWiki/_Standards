## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Osiris** (, from Egyptian wsjr) was the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, 
> the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in ancient Egyptian religion. 
> 
> He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh's beard, 
> partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown 
> and holding a symbolic crook and flail. 
> 
> He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap. 
> When his brother Set cut him to pieces after killing him, with her sister Nephthys, 
> Osiris's sister-wife, Isis, searched Egypt to find each part of Osiris. 
> She collected all but one – Osiris's genitalia. 
> She then wrapped his body up, enabling him to return to life. 
> Osiris was widely worshipped until the decline of ancient Egyptian religion 
> during the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire.
>
> Osiris was at times considered the eldest son of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, 
> as well as brother and husband of Isis, and brother of Set, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder, 
> with Horus the Younger being considered his posthumously begotten son. 
> Through syncretism with Iah, he was also a god of the Moon.
>
> Osiris was the judge and lord of the dead and the underworld, the "Lord of Silence" 
> and Khenti-Amentiu, meaning "Foremost of the Westerners". 
> 
> In the Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC) the pharaoh was considered a son of the sun god Ra 
> who, after his death, ascended to join Ra in the sky. 
> 
> After the spread of the Osiris cult, however, 
> the kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death – as Osiris rose from the dead, 
> they would unite with him and inherit eternal life through imitative magic. 
> 
> Through the hope of new life after death, 
> Osiris began to be associated with the cycles in nature, 
> in particular the sprouting of vegetation and annual flooding of the Nile River, 
> as well as the heliacal rising of Orion and Sirius at the start of the new year. 
> He became the sovereign that granted all life, "He Who is Permanently Benign and Youthful".
>
> The first evidence of the worship of Osiris is from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt 
> (25th century BC), though it is likely he was worshiped much earlier; 
> the Khenti-Amentiu epithet dates to at least the First Dynasty, 
> and was used as a pharaonic title. 
> 
> Most information available on the Osiris myth is derived from allusions in the Pyramid Texts 
> at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, later New Kingdom source documents 
> such as the Shabaka Stone and "The Contendings of Horus and Seth", 
> and much later, in the narratives of Greek authors including Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus. 
> 
> Some Egyptologists believe the Osiris mythos may have originated in a former living ruler—
> possibly a shepherd who lived in Predynastic times (5500–3100 BC) in the Nile Delta, 
> whose beneficial rule led to him being revered as a god. 
> 
> The accoutrements of the shepherd, the crook and the flail – 
> once insignia of the Delta god Andjety, with whom Osiris was associated – support this theory.
