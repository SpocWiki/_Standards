## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Aten**, also Aton, Atonu, or Itn (Ancient Egyptian: jtn, reconstructed [ˈjaːtin]) was the focus of Atenism, 
> the religious system formally established in ancient Egypt by the late Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]. 
> 
> Exact dating for the Eighteenth Dynasty is contested, 
> though a general date range places the dynasty in the years 1550 to 1292 BCE. 
> 
> The worship of Aten and the coinciding rule of Akhenaten are major identifying characteristics of a period 
> within the Eighteenth Dynasty referred to as the Amarna Period (c. 1353 – 1336 BCE).
>
> Atenism and the worship of the Aten as the sole god of ancient Egypt state worship 
> did not persist beyond Akhenaten's death. 
> 
> Not long after his death, one of Akhenaten's Eighteenth Dynasty successors, Tutankhamun, 
> reopened the state temples to other Egyptian gods and re-positioned Amun as the pre-eminent solar deity. 
> Aten is depicted as a solar disc emitting rays terminating in human hands.
