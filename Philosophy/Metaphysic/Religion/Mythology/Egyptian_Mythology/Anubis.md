> **Anubis** ( ; Ancient Greek: Ἄνουβις), also known as Inpu, Inpw, Jnpw, or Anpu in Ancient Egyptian 
> (Coptic: ⲁⲛⲟⲩⲡ, romanized: Anoup), is the god of funerary rites, protector of graves, 
> and guide to the underworld in ancient Egyptian religion, 
> usually depicted as a canine or a man with a Jackal head.
>
> Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. 
> Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100 – c. 2890 BC), 
> Anubis was also an embalmer. 
> 
> By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) 
> he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. 
> 
> One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. 
> He attended the weighing scale during the "Weighing of the Heart", 
> in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. 
> Anubis is one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods in the Egyptian pantheon; 
> however, few major myths involved him.
>
> Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, 
> and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. 
> 
> Anubis is associated with Wepwawet, another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog's head 
> or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. 
> Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined. 
> Anubis' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.
