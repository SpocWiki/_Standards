> **Amun** was a major ancient Egyptian deity who appears as a member of the Hermopolitan Ogdoad. 
> Amun was attested from the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amunet. 
> 
> His oracle in Siwa Oasis, located in Western Egypt near the Libyan Desert, 
> remained the only oracle of Amun throughout. 
> With the 11th Dynasty (c. 21st century BC), 
> Amun rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Montu.
>
> Initially possibly one of eight deities in the Hermapolite creation myth, his worship expanded. 
> 
> After the rebellion of Thebes against the Hyksos and with the rule of Ahmose I (16th century BC), 
> Amun acquired national importance, 
> expressed in his fusion with the Sun god, Ra, as Amun-Ra (alternatively spelled Amon-Ra or Amun-Re). 
> On his own, he was also thought to be the king of the gods.
>
> Amun-Ra retained chief importance in the Egyptian pantheon throughout the New Kingdom 
> (with the exception of the "Atenist heresy" under Akhenaten). 
> 
> Amun-Ra in this period (16th–11th centuries BC) held the position of transcendental, 
> self-created creator deity "par excellence"; 
> he was the champion of the poor or troubled and central to personal piety. 
> 
> With Osiris, Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods. 
>
> As the chief deity of the Egyptian Empire, Amun-Ra also came to be worshiped outside Egypt, 
> according to the testimony of ancient Greek historiographers in Libya and Nubia. 
> As Zeus Ammon and Jupiter Ammon, he came to be identified with Zeus in Greece and Jupiter in Rome.
