> In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Mars (Latin: Mārs, pronounced [maːrs]) 
> is the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, 
> a combination characteristic of early Rome. 
> 
> He is the son of Jupiter and Juno, 
> and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods. 
> 
> Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), 
> and in October, the months which traditionally began and ended the season 
> for both military campaigning and farming.
>
> Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares, 
> whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. 
> 
> The character and dignity of Mars differs in fundamental ways 
> from that of his Greek counterpart, 
> who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature. 
> 
> Mars's altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome; in Republican times it was a focus of electoral activities. Augustus shifted the focus of Mars's cult to within the pomerium (Rome's ritual boundary), and built a temple to Mars Ultor as a key religious feature of his new forum.

> Unlike Ares, who was viewed primarily as a destructive and destabilizing force, Mars represented military power as a way to secure peace, and was a father (pater) of the Roman people. In Rome's mythic genealogy and founding, Mars fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia. The wolf was the sacred animal of Mars, with the she-wolf nursing the two founders as children. His love affair with Venus symbolically reconciled two different traditions of Rome's founding; Venus was the divine mother of the hero Aeneas, credited by Vergil as an earlier founder of Rome.
