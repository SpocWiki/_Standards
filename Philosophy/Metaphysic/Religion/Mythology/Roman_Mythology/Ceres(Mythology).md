> In ancient Roman religion, Ceres ( SEER-eez, Latin: [ˈkɛreːs]) 
> was a goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships. 
> 
> She was originally the central deity in Rome's so-called plebeian or Aventine Triad, 
> then was paired with her daughter Proserpina 
> in what Romans described as "the Greek rites of Ceres". 
> 
> Her seven-day April festival of Cerealia included the popular Ludi Ceriales (Ceres' games). 
> She was also honoured in the May lustration (lustratio) of the fields 
> at the Ambarvalia festival at harvesttime 
> and during Roman marriages and funeral rites. 
> She is usually depicted as a mature woman.
>
> Ceres is the only one of Rome's many agricultural deities to be listed among the Dii Consentes, 
> Rome's equivalent to the Twelve Olympians of Greek mythology. 
> The Romans saw her as the counterpart of the Greek goddess Demeter, 
> whose mythology was reinterpreted for Ceres in Roman art and literature.
