## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Pluto (Ancient Greek: Πλούτων, 
> romanized: Ploútōn, Latin: Plūto or Plūton), also known as Dis Pater or Orcus, 
> was the god of the dead and the king of the underworld. 
> 
> The name was originally an epithet or theonym for Hades in ancient Greek mythology, 
> although Pluto was more associated with wealth 
> and never used as a synonym for the underworld itself, 
> representing a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife. 
> 
> He was the eldest son of Saturn (Cronus) and Ops (Rhea), 
> as well as the brother of Jupiter (Zeus) and Neptune (Poseidon). 
> Pluto later married Proserpina (Persephone) and shared many of Hades' attributes, 
> such as the bident, the cap of invisibility, and the three-headed guard dog Cerberus.
>
> While Pluto is commonly considered the Roman equivalent of Hades, 
> the name Plouton was already used by the Greeks to designate Hades 
> and was later adopted by the Romans for their god of the underworld, Dis Pater, 
> which often means "Rich Father" and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton. 
> 
> Pluto was also identified with the obscure god Orcus, 
> a name that the Romans adopted from the Etruscans and which, like Hades, 
> was both for the god of the underworld and for the underworld as a place. 
> 
> On the other hand, Ploutōn was frequently conflated with Ploûtos, the Greek god of wealth, 
> because mineral wealth was found underground 
> and because, as a chthonic god, Pluto ruled the deep earth 
> that contained the seeds needed for a bountiful harvest.
>
> Pluto becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld 
> in subsequent Western literature and other art forms, 
> although in recent years it has lost relevance compared to Hades.
