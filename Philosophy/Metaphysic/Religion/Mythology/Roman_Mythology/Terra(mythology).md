> In ancient Roman religion and mythology, Tellus or Terra ("Mother Earth") 
> is the personification of the Earth. 
> Although Tellus and Terra are hardly distinguishable during the Imperial era, 
> Tellus was the name of the original earth goddess 
> in the religious practices of the Republic or earlier. 
> 
> The scholar Varro (1st century BC) lists Tellus as one of the di selecti, 
> the twenty principal gods of Rome, and one of the twelve agricultural deities. 
> She is regularly associated with Ceres in rituals pertaining to the earth and agricultural fertility.
>
> The attributes of Tellus were the cornucopia, bunches of flowers, or fruit. 
> She was typically depicted reclining, or rising, waist high from a hole in the ground. 
> Her male complement was a sky god such as Caelus (Uranus) or a form of Jupiter. 
> 
> Her Greek counterpart is [[../Greek_Mythology/Gaia|Gaia]], and among the Etruscans, her name was Cel. 
> 
> Michael Lipka has argued that the Terra Mater who appeared during the reign of Augustus, 
> is a direct transfer of the Greek Ge Mater into Roman religious practice, 
> while Tellus, whose ancient temple was within Rome's sacred boundary (pomerium), 
> represents the original earth goddess cultivated by the state priests.
