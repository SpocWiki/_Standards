## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt, 
> which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world around them. 
> 
> The beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. 
> Myths appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories 
> and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. 
> These sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments.
>
> Inspired by the cycles of nature, the Egyptians saw time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, 
> whereas the earliest periods of time were linear. 
> 
> Myths are set in these earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the present. 
> Present events repeat the events of myth, 
> and in doing so renew maat, the fundamental order of the universe. 
> 
> Amongst the most important episodes from the mythic past are the creation myths, 
> in which the gods form the universe out of primordial chaos; 
> the stories of the reign of the sun god Ra upon the earth; 
> and the Osiris myth, concerning the struggles of the gods Osiris, Isis, and Horus 
> against the disruptive god Set. 
> 
> Events from the present that might be regarded as myths include 
> Ra's daily journey through the world and its otherworldly counterpart, the Duat. 
> Recurring themes in these mythic episodes include the conflict between the upholders of maat 
> and the forces of disorder, the importance of the pharaoh in maintaining maat, 
> and the continual death and regeneration of the gods.
>
> The details of these sacred events differ greatly from one text to another 
> and often seem contradictory. 
> 
> Egyptian myths are primarily metaphorical, 
> translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can understand. 
> Each variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, 
> enriching the Egyptians' understanding of the gods and the world.
>
> Mythology profoundly influenced Egyptian culture. 
> It inspired or influenced many religious rituals and provided the ideological basis for kingship. 
> Scenes and symbols from myth appeared in art in tombs, temples, and amulets. 
> In literature, myths or elements of them were used in stories that range from humor to allegory, 
> demonstrating that the Egyptians adapted mythology to serve a wide variety of purposes.
