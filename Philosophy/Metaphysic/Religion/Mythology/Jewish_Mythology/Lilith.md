## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Lilith** (Hebrew: לִילִית, romanized: Līlīṯ), also spelled Lilit, Lilitu, or Lilis, 
> is a feminine figure in Mesopotamian and Jewish mythology. 
> According to accounts in the Talmud she is the first wife of Adam 
> and a primordial she-demon. 
> Lilith is cited as having been "banished" from the Garden of Eden 
> for disobeying Adam.
>
> The stem Hebrew word from which the name Lilith is taken is in the Biblical Hebrew, 
> in the Book of Isaiah, though Lilith herself is not mentioned in any biblical text. 
> 
> In late antiquity in Mandaean and Jewish sources from 500 AD onward, 
> Lilith appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and localities that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Bava Batra 73a), in the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan as Adam's first wife, and in the Zohar § Leviticus 19a as "a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man". Many rabbinic authorities, including Maimonides and Menachem Meiri, reject the existence of Lilith.
>
> The name Lilith seems related to the masculine Akkadian word lilû and its female variants lilītu and ardat lilî. The lil- root is shared by the Hebrew word lilit appearing in Isaiah 34:14, which is thought to be a night bird by modern scholars such as Judit M. Blair. In Mesopotamian religion according to the cuneiform texts of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia, lilû are a class of demonic spirits, consisting of adolescents who died before they could bear children. Many have also connected her to the Mesopotamian demon Lamashtu, who shares similar traits and a similar position in mythology to Lilith.
>
> Lilith continues to serve as source material in today's literature, popular culture, Western culture, occultism, fantasy, horror, and erotica.
