## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Christmas** is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, 
> observed primarily on December 25 
> as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. 
> 
> A liturgical feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent 
> and it is followed by Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days 
> and culminates on Twelfth Night. 
> 
> Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, 
> as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, 
> and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.
>
> The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, 
> says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. 
> When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, 
> and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, 
> with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.
>
> There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth. 
> In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, 
> the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. 
> It is nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox. 
> 
> Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, 
> which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. 
> 
> However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 
> of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. 
> For Christians, celebrating that God came into the world in the form of man 
> to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than knowing Jesus's exact birth date.
>
> The customs associated with Christmas in various countries 
> have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. 
> 
> Popular holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; 
> Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; 
> an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; 
> and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, 
> Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. 
> 
> Additionally, several related and often interchangeable figures, known as 
> - Santa Claus, 
> - Father Christmas, 
> - Saint Nicholas, and 
> - Christkind, 
> are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season 
> and have their own body of traditions and lore. 
> 
> Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival 
> involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event 
> and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. 
> Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect 
> in many regions of the world.
