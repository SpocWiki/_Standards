> The Catholic Church has profoundly influenced Western philosophy, culture, art, literature, music, law and science. Catholics live all over the world through missions, immigration, diaspora and conversions. Since the 20th century the majority have resided in the Global South, partially due to secularization in Europe and North America. The Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East–West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the pope. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431, the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox Churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451; all separated primarily over differences in Christology. The Eastern Catholic Churches, which have a combined membership of approximately 18 million, represent a body of Eastern Christians who returned or remained in communion with the pope during or following these schisms due to a variety of historical circumstances. In the 16th century the Reformation led to the formation of separate, Protestant groups and to the Counter-Reformation.  From the late 20th century the Catholic Church has been criticized for its teachings on sexuality, its doctrine against ordaining women and its handling of sexual abuse committed by clergy.

> The Diocese of Rome, led by the pope as its bishop, constitutes his local jurisdiction, while the See of Rome—commonly referred to as the Holy See—serves as the central governing authority of the Catholic Church. The administrative body of the Holy See, the Roman Curia, has its principal offices in Vatican City, which is a small, independent city-state and enclave within the city of Rome, of which the pope is head of state and the elective and absolute monarch.
