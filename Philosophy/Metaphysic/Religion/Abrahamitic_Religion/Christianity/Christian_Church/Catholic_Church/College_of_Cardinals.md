> The College of Cardinals (Latin: Collegium Cardinalium), also called the Sacred College of Cardinals, 
> is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. 
> 
> As of 8 August 2025, there are 248 cardinals, 
> of whom 130 are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope. 
> Appointed by the pope, cardinals serve for life, 
> but become ineligible to participate in a papal conclave if they turn 80 before a papal vacancy occurs.
>
> Since the emergence of the College of Cardinals in the Early Middle Ages, 
> the size of the body has historically been limited by popes, 
> ecumenical councils ratified by the pope, and the college itself. 
> 
> The total number of cardinals from 1099 to 1986 has been about 2,900, nearly half of whom were created after 1655. This number excludes possible undocumented 12th-century cardinals and pseudocardinals appointed during the Western Schism by pontiffs now considered to be antipopes, and subject to some other sources of uncertainty.
