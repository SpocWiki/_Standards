> In ecclesiology, the Christian Church is what different Christian denominations conceive of as 
> being the true body of Christians or the original institution established by Jesus Christ. 
> 
> "Christian Church" has also been used in academia as a synonym for Christianity, 
> despite the fact that it is composed of multiple churches or denominations, 
> many of which hold a doctrinal claim of being the one true church to the exclusion of the others.
>
> For many Protestant Christians, the Christian Church has two components: 
> the church visible, institutions in which "the Word of God purely preached and listened to, 
> and the sacraments administered according to Christ's institution", 
> as well as the church invisible—all "who are truly saved" (with these beings members of the visible church). 
> 
> In this understanding of the invisible church, "Christian Church" (or catholic Church) 
> does not refer to a particular Christian denomination, but includes all individuals who have been saved. 
> 
> This is in contrast to the one true church applied to a specific concrete Christian institution, 
> a Christian ecclesiological position maintained by the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Churches, 
> the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, Assyrian Church of the East, 
> and the Ancient Church of the East. 
> 
> While holding this view, the Lutheran Churches teach that 
> "there are indeed true Christians in other churches" 
> as "other denominations also preach the Word of God, though mixed with error". 
> 
> The branch theory, which is maintained by some Anglicans, 
> holds that those Churches that have preserved apostolic succession are part of the true Church, 
> though the majority of Anglicanism has historically 
> "followed the major continental Reformers in their doctrine of the true church, 
> identifiable by the authentic ministry of word and sacrament, 
> in their rejection of the jurisdiction of the pope, 
> and in their alliance with the civil authority ('the magistrate')".

> Most English translations of the New Testament generally use the word church as a translation of the Ancient Greek ἐκκλησία (romanized ecclesia), found in the original Greek texts, which generally meant an "assembly" or "congregation". This term appears in two verses of the Gospel of Matthew, 24 verses of the Acts of the Apostles, 58 verses of the Pauline epistles (including the earliest instances of its use in relation to a Christian body), two verses of the Letter to the Hebrews, one verse of the Epistle of James, three verses of the Third Epistle of John, and 19 verses of the Book of Revelation. In total, ἐκκλησία appears 114 times in the New Testament, although not every instance is a technical reference to the church. As such it is used for local communities as well as in a universal sense to mean all believers. The earliest recorded use of the term Christianity (Greek: Χριστιανισμός) was by Ignatius of Antioch, in around 100 AD.

> The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed (381) are that the Church is one, holy, catholic (universal), and apostolic (originating from the apostles).
