> Theology is the study of religious belief from a religious perspective, 
> with a focus on the nature of divinity and the history behind religion. 
> It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries. 
> 
> It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, 
> asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. 
> Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, 
> but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and to reveal themselves to humankind.
>
> **Theologian**s use various forms of analysis and argument (experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical...) 
> to help understand, explain, test, critique, defend or promote any myriad of religious topics. 
> 
> As in philosophy of ethics and case law, arguments often assume the existence of previously resolved questions, 
> and develop by making analogies from them to draw new inferences in new situations.
>
> The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, 
> another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity 
> without reference to any specific tradition. 
> 
> Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; 
> or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), 
> or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. 
> 
> Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, 
> or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world.
