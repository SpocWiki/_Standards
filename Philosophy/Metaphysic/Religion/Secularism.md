## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Secularism** is the principle of seeking to conduct human affairs 
> based on naturalistic considerations, uninvolved with religion. 
> 
> It is most commonly thought of as 
> the separation of religion from civil affairs and the state, 
> and may be broadened to a similar position 
> seeking to remove or to minimize the role of religion in any public sphere. 
> 
> Secularism may encapsulate 
> anti-clericalism, atheism, naturalism, non-sectarianism, neutrality on topics of religion, or antireligion. 
> 
> Secularism is not necessarily antithetical to religion, but may be compatible with it. 
> As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life based on principles 
> derived solely from the material world, without recourse to religion. 
> It shifts the focus from religion towards "temporal" and material concerns.
>
> There are distinct traditions of secularism like the 
> French, Turkish, American and Indian models. 
> 
> These differ greatly, from the American emphasis on 
> avoiding an established religion and freedom of belief, 
> to the French interventionist model, and more. 
> 
> The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely, 
> ranging from assertions that it is a crucial element of modernization, 
> or that religion and traditional values are backward and divisive, 
> to the claim that it is the only guarantor of free religious exercise. 
>
> Both "religion" and "secular" are Western concepts 
> that are not universal across cultures, languages, or time; 
> with experiences of secularism varying significantly. 
> 
> Secularism has origins going back to the ancient world 
> into religious texts such as the Bible, 
> being refined through history by religious thinkers. 
> 
> Secular individuals hold complex relations to religion.
