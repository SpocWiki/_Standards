## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Taoism** or Daoism is a philosophical and religious tradition indigenous to China, 
> emphasizing harmony with the Tao 道 (Chinese: 道; pinyin: dào, pronounced (IPA): /tɑʊ̯/). 
> 
> With a range of meaning in Chinese philosophy, 
> translations of Tao include 'way', 'road', 'path', or 'technique', 
> generally understood in the Taoist sense as an enigmatic process of transformation 
> ultimately underlying reality. 
> 
> Taoist thought has informed the development of various practices within the Taoist tradition, 
> ideation of mathematics and beyond, including forms of meditation, astrology, qigong, feng shui, and internal alchemy. 
> 
> A common goal of Taoist practice is self-cultivation, a deeper appreciation of the Tao, 
> and more harmonious existence. 
> Taoist ethics vary, but generally emphasize such virtues as 
> effortless action, naturalness, simplicity, and the three treasures of compassion, frugality, and humility.
>
> The core of Taoist thought crystallized during the early Warring States period (c. 450 – c. 300 BCE), 
> during which the epigrammatic Tao Te Ching and the anecdotal Zhuangzi—
> widely regarded as the fundamental texts of Taoist philosophy—were largely composed. 
> 
> They form the core of a body of Taoist writings accrued over the following centuries, 
> which was assembled by monks into the Daozang canon starting in the 5th century CE. 
> 
> Early Taoism drew upon diverse influences, including 
> - the Shang and Zhou state religions, 
> - Naturalism, 
> - Mohism, 
> - Confucianism, 
> - various Legalist theories, 
> - as well as the I Ching and 
> - Spring and Autumn Annals.
>
> Taoism and Confucianism developed significant differences. 
> Taoism emphasizes naturalness and spontaneity in human experience, 
> whereas Confucianism regards social institutions—family, education, community, and the state—as essential to human flourishing and moral development. 
> 
> Nonetheless, they are not seen as mutually incompatible or exclusive, 
> sharing many views toward "humanity, society, the ruler, heaven, and the universe". 
> 
> The relationship between Taoism and Buddhism upon the latter's introduction to China 
> is characterized as one of mutual influence, 
> with long-running discourses shared between Taoists and Buddhists; 
> the distinct Mahayana tradition of Zen that emerged during the Tang dynasty (618–907) 
> incorporates many ideas from Taoism.
>
> Many Taoist denominations recognize deities, often ones shared with other traditions, which are venerated as superhuman figures exemplifying Taoist virtues. They can be roughly divided into two categories of "gods" and xian (or "immortals"). Xian were immortal beings with vast supernatural powers, also describing a principled, moral person. Since Taoist thought is syncretic and deeply rooted in Chinese culture for millennia, it is often unclear which denominations should be considered "Taoist".
>
> The status of daoshi, or 'Taoist master', is traditionally attributed only to clergy in Taoist organizations, who distinguish between their traditions and others in Chinese folk religion. Though generally lacking motivation for strong hierarchies, Taoist philosophy has often served as a theoretical foundation for politics, warfare, and Taoist organizations. Taoist secret societies precipitated the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the late Han dynasty, attempting to create what has been characterized as a Taoist theocracy.
>
> Today, Taoism is one of five religious doctrines officially recognized by the Chinese government, also having official status in Hong Kong and Macau. It is considered a major religion in Taiwan, and also has significant populations of adherents throughout the Sinosphere and Southeast Asia. In the West, Taoism has taken on various forms, both those hewing to historical practice, as well as highly synthesized practices variously characterized as new religious movements.
