## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In religious context, **Sin** is a transgression against divine law or a law of the deities. 
> 
> Each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin. 
> While sins are generally considered actions, any thought, word, or act 
> considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed "sinful".
>
> The concept of sin originates from the Old English synn, 
> tracing back to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots meaning “being” or “truly guilty,” 
> implying a judgment of wrongdoing. 
> 
> Over time, different religions and cultures developed distinct understandings of sin, 
> often shaping moral frameworks and spiritual practices.
>
> In Buddhism, sin as defiance against a deity does not exist; instead, 
> actions naturally bring consequences through karma. While general “sin” refers to transgressions against universal moral law, five acts — harming a Buddha, killing an Arhat, creating schism in the Sangha, matricide, and patricide — are considered so severe that they bring immediate karmic repercussions. In contrast, Shinto views sin (tsumi) as impurity caused by external factors like evil spirits, not inherently by human actions, and emphasizes purification rituals (harae) to restore harmony.
>
> In Abrahamic religions, sin carries a stronger theological dimension. Christianity treats sin as an offense against God, rooted in disobedience, with doctrines like original sin and redemption through Christ’s sacrifice; concepts like the seven deadly sins classify vices leading to moral corruption. Islam defines sin (khiṭʾ, ithm) as violating God’s commands, distinguishing between minor and grave sins. Judaism frames sin as “missing the mark” of God’s law, placing greater weight on wrongs against other people than against God, with atonement often requiring repentance and restitution.
