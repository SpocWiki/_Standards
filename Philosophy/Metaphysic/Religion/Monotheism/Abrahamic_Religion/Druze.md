## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Druze**, who call themselves al-Muwaḥḥidūn (lit. 'the monotheists'  or 'the unitarians'), 
> are an Arab esoteric religious group from West Asia who adhere to the Druze faith, 
> an Abrahamic, monotheistic, and syncretic religion whose main tenets 
> assert the unity of God, reincarnation, and the eternity of the soul.
>
> Although the Druze faith developed from Isma'ilism, Druze do not identify as Muslims. 
> They maintain the Arabic language and culture as integral parts of their identity, 
> with Arabic being their primary language. 
> 
> Most Druze religious practices are kept secret, 
> and conversion to their religion is not permitted for outsiders. 
> Interfaith marriages are rare and strongly discouraged. 
> 
> They differentiate between spiritual individuals, known as "uqqāl", who hold the faith's secrets, 
> and secular ones, known as "juhhāl", who focus on worldly matters. 
> Druze believe that, after completing the cycle of rebirth through successive reincarnations, 
> the soul reunites with the Cosmic Mind (al-ʻaql al-kullī).
>
> The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational and central text of the Druze faith. The Druze faith originated in Isma'ilism (a branch of Shia Islam), and has been influenced by a diverse range of traditions, including Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism,, and Pythagoreanism. This has led to the development of a distinct and secretive theology, characterized by an esoteric interpretation of scripture that emphasizes the importance of the mind and truthfulness. Druze beliefs include the concepts of theophany and reincarnation.
>
> The Druze hold Shuaib in high regard, believing him to be the same person as the biblical Jethro. They regard Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, and the Isma'ili Imam Muhammad ibn Isma'il as prophets. Additionally, Druze tradition honors figures such as Salman the Persian, al-Khidr (whom they identify with Elijah, John the Baptist and Saint George), Job, Luke the Evangelist, and others as "mentors" and "prophets".
>
> The Druze faith is one of the major religious groups in the Levant, with between 800,000 and a million adherents. They are primarily located in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, with smaller communities in Jordan. They make up 5.5% of Lebanon's population, 3% of Syria's and 1.6% of Israel's. The oldest and most densely populated Druze communities exist in Mount Lebanon and in the south of Syria around Jabal al-Druze (literally the "Mountain of the Druze").
>
> The Druze community played a critically important role in shaping the history of the Levant, where it continues to play a significant political role. As a religious minority, they have often faced persecution from various Muslim regimes, including contemporary Islamic extremism.
>
> Several theories about the origins of the Druze have been proposed, with the Arabian hypothesis being the most widely accepted among historians, intellectuals, and religious leaders within the Druze community. This hypothesis significantly influences the Druze's self-perception, cultural identity, and both oral and written traditions. It suggests that the Druze are descended from 12 Arab tribes that migrated to Syria before and during the early Islamic period. This perspective is accepted by the entire Druze communities in Syria and Lebanon, as well as by most Druze in Israel.
