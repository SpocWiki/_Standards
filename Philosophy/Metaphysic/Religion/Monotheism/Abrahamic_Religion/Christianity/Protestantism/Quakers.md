> **Quakers** are people who belong to the Religious Society of Friends, 
> originally known as simply the Society of Friends, 
> a historically Protestant Christian set of denominations. 
> 
> Members refer to each other as Friends after John 15:14 in the Bible. 
> Originally, others referred to them as Quakers because the founder of the movement, 
> George Fox, told a judge to "quake before the authority of God". (see Earthquake)
>
> The Friends are generally united by a belief in each human's ability 
> to be guided by the inward light to "make the witness of God" known to everyone. 
> 
> Quakers have traditionally professed a priesthood of all believers 
> inspired by the First Epistle of Peter. 
> 
> They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, 
> and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity, as well as Nontheist Quakers. 
> To differing extents, the Friends avoid creeds and hierarchical structures. 
> In 2017, there were an estimated 377,557 adult Quakers, 
> 49% of them in Africa followed by 22% in North America.
>
> Some 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to evangelical and programmed branches 
> that hold services with singing and a prepared Bible message coordinated by a pastor 
> (with the largest Quaker group being the Evangelical Friends Church International). 
> 
> Some 11% practice waiting worship or unprogrammed worship 
> (commonly Meeting for Worship), where the unplanned order of service is mainly silent 
> and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present. 
> Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers present, 
> Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry.
>
> Quakerism is a mystical Christian movement 
> variously described as both proto-evangelical and universalistic, quietist and progressive. 
> 
> It arose in mid-17th-century England from the Legatine-Arians 
> and other dissenting Protestant groups breaking with the established Church of England. 
> 
> The Quakers, especially the Valiant Sixty, sought to convert others 
> by travelling through Britain and overseas preaching the Gospel; 
> some early Quaker ministers were women. 
> 
> They based their message on a belief that "Christ has come to teach his people himself", 
> stressing direct relations with God through Jesus Christ 
> and belief in the universal priesthood of all believers. 
> 
> This personal religious experience of Christ was acquired by direct experience 
> and by reading and studying the Bible. 
>
> Friends focused their private lives on behaviour and speech 
> reflecting emotional purity and the light of God, with a goal of Christian perfection. 
> 
> A prominent theological text of the Religious Society of Friends is 
> A Catechism and Confession of Faith (1673), published by Quaker divine Robert Barclay. 
> 
> The Richmond Declaration of Faith (1887) was adopted by many Orthodox Friends 
> and continues to serve as a doctrinal statement of many yearly meetings.
>
> Quakers were known to use thee as an ordinary pronoun, to wear plain dress, and to practice teetotalism. 
> They refused to swear oaths or to participate in war, and they opposed slavery. 
>
> Some Quakers founded banks and financial institutions, including Barclays, Lloyds, 
> and Friends Provident; manufacturers including the footwear firm of C. & J. Clark 
> and the big three British confectionery makers Cadbury, Rowntree and Fry; 
> and philanthropic efforts, including abolition of slavery, prison reform, and social justice. 
> 
> In 1947, in recognition of their dedication to peace and the common good, 
> Quakers represented by the British Friends Service Council 
> and the American Friends Service Committee were awarded the [[../../../../../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization/International_Organization/NGO(non-governmental_organization)/Nobel_Prize/Peace_Nobel_Prize|Peace_Nobel_Prize]] .
