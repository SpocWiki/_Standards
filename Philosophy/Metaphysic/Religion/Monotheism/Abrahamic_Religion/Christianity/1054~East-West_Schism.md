> The East–West Schism, also known as the Great Schism or the Schism of 1054, 
> is the break of communion between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
> 
> A series of ecclesiastical differences and theological disputes between the Greek East and Latin West 
> preceded the formal split that occurred in 1054. 
> Prominent among these were the procession of the Holy Spirit (Filioque), 
> whether leavened or unleavened bread should be used in the Eucharist, iconoclasm, 
> the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor of the Romans in 800, the pope's claim to universal jurisdiction, 
> and the place of the See of Constantinople in relation to the pentarchy.
>
> The first action that led to a formal schism occurred in 1053 
> when Patriarch Michael I Cerularius of Constantinople 
> ordered the closure of all Latin churches in Constantinople. 
> 
> In 1054, the papal legate sent by Leo IX travelled to Constantinople in order, among other things, 
> to deny Cerularius the title of "ecumenical patriarch" 
> and insist that he recognize the pope's claim to be the head of all of the churches. 
> 
> The main purposes of the papal legation were to seek help from the Byzantine emperor, 
> Constantine IX Monomachos, in view of the Norman conquest of southern Italy, 
> and to respond to Leo of Ohrid's attacks on the use of unleavened bread and other Western customs, 
> attacks that had the support of Cerularius. 
> 
> The historian Axel Bayer says that the legation was sent in response to two letters, 
> one from the emperor seeking help to organize 
> a joint military campaign by the eastern and western empires against the Normans, 
> and the other from Cerularius. 
> When the leader of the legation, Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida, O.S.B., learned 
> that Cerularius had refused to accept the demand, he excommunicated him, 
> and in response Cerularius excommunicated Humbert and the other legates. 
> According to Kallistos Ware, "Even after 1054 friendly relations between East and West continued. 
> The two parts of Christendom were not yet conscious of a great gulf of separation between them ... 
> The dispute remained something of which ordinary Christians in East and West were largely unaware".
>
> The validity of the Western legates' act is doubtful because Pope Leo had died 
> and Cerularius' excommunication only applied to the legates personally. 
> Still, the Church split along doctrinal, theological, linguistic, political, and geographical lines, 
> and the fundamental breach has never been healed: 
> each side occasionally accuses the other of committing heresy and of having initiated the schism. 
> 
> Reconciliation was made increasingly difficult in the generations that followed; events such as the Latin-led Crusades, though originally intended to aid the Eastern Church, only served to further tension. The Massacre of the Latins in 1182 greatly deepened existing animosity and led to the West's retaliation via the Sacking of Thessalonica in 1185, the capture and pillaging of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the imposition of Latin patriarchs. The emergence of competing Greek and Latin hierarchies in the Crusader states, especially with two claimants to the patriarchal sees of Antioch, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, made the existence of a schism clear. Several attempts at reconciliation did not bear fruit.

> In 1965, Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I nullified the anathemas of 1054, although this was a nullification of measures taken against only a few individuals, merely as a gesture of goodwill and not constituting any sort of reunion. The absence of full communion between the Churches is even explicitly mentioned when the Code of Canon Law gives Catholic ministers permission to administer the sacraments of penance, the Eucharist, and the anointing of the sick to members of eastern churches such as the Eastern Orthodox Church (as well as the Oriental Orthodox churches and the Church of the East) and members of western churches such as the Old Catholic Church, when those members spontaneously request these. Contacts between the two sides continue. Every year a delegation from each joins in the other's celebration of its patronal feast, Saints Peter and Paul (29 June) for Rome and Saint Andrew (30 November) for Constantinople, and there have been several visits by the head of each to the other. The efforts of the ecumenical patriarchs towards reconciliation with the Catholic Church have often been the target of sharp internal criticism.

> Although 1054 has become conventional, various scholars have proposed different dates for the Great Schism, including 1009, 1204, 1277, and 1484. Greek Orthodox Saint and theologian Nectarios of Pentapolis dated the schism to the Council of Florence.
