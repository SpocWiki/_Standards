## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hijab** (Arabic: حجاب, romanized: ḥijāb, pronounced [ħɪˈdʒaːb]) 
> refers to head coverings worn by Muslim women. 
> 
> Similar to the mitpaḥat/tichel or snood 
> worn by religiously observing married Jewish women, 
> certain headcoverings worn by some Christian women, 
> such as the hanging veil, apostolnik and kapp, 
> and the dupatta favored by many Hindu and Sikh women, the hijab comes in various forms. 
> 
> The term describes a scarf that is wrapped around the head, 
> covering the hair, neck, and ears while leaving the face visible. 
> 
> The use of the hijab, voluntarily and involuntarily, has grown globally since the 1970s, 
> with religious Muslims viewing it as a symbol of modesty and faith; 
> it is also worn as a form of adornment. 
> 
> There is consensus among mainstream Islamic religious scholars 
> that covering the head is required.
>
> The term ḥijāb was originally used to denote a partition 
> and was sometimes used for Islamic rules of modesty. 
> 
> The Qur'an never uses the word hijab (lit. 'barrier') to refer to women's clothing, 
> but rather discusses the attire of women using other terms Jilbāb and khimār (generic headscarf).
>
> There is variation in interpretations regarding the extent of covering required. 
> Some legal systems accept the hijab as an order to cover everything 
> except the face and hands, whilst others accept it as an order to cover the whole body, 
> including the face and hands, via niqab. 
> 
> These guidelines are found in texts of hadith and fiqh 
> developed after the revelation of the Qur'an. 
> Some state that these guidelines are aligned with Qur'anic verses (ayahs) about hijab.
>
> Islamic veiling practices vary globally based on local laws and customs. 
> In some regions, the hijab is mandated by law, 
> while in others, its use is subject to restrictions or bans. 
> 
> Additionally, women face informal pressure from men and religious women 
> regarding their choice to wear or not wear the hijab.
