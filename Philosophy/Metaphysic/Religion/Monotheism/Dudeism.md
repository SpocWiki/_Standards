## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dudeism** is a religion, philosophy, or lifestyle inspired by "The Dude", 
> the protagonist of the Coen Brothers' 1998 film The [[../../../../../Society/Communication/Media/Movie/Movie-Genre/Comedy/Big_Lebowski]].
>
> Dudeism's stated primary objective is to promote a modern form of Chinese [[../Nontheism/Natural_Law_Religion/Taoism]], 
> outlined in Tao Te Ching by [[../../../../Philosopher/Ancient_Philosopher/Laozi|Laozi]] (6th century BCE), 
> blended with concepts from the Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BCE), 
> and presented in a style as personified by the character of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, 
> a fictional character portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the film. 
> 
> Dudeism has sometimes been regarded as a mock religion 
> due to its use of comedic film references 
> and occasional criticism of religion in its traditional sense; 
> however, its founder and many adherents 
> take the underlying philosophy somewhat (although not overly) seriously. 
> 
> March 6 is the annual sacred high holy day of Dudeism; entitled The Day of the Dude, 
> the holiday is practiced on the same day the film was released in the US.
