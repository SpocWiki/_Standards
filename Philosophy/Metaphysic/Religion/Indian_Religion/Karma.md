## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Karma** (from Sanskrit: कर्म, IPA: [ˈkɐɾmɐ] ; Pali: kamma) is an ancient Indian concept 
> that refers to an action, work, or deed, and its effect or consequences. 
> 
> In Indian religions, the term more specifically refers to a principle of cause and effect, 
> often descriptively called the principle of karma, 
> wherein individuals' intent and actions (cause) influence their future (effect): 
> Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, 
> while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and worse rebirths. 
> In some scriptures, however, there is no link between rebirth and karma. 
>
> In Hinduism, karma is traditionally classified into four types: Sanchita karma (accumulated karma from past actions across lifetimes), Prārabdha karma (a portion of Sanchita karma that is currently bearing fruit and determines the circumstances of the present life), Āgāmi karma (future karma generated by present actions), and Kriyamāṇa karma (immediate karma created by current actions, which may yield results in the present or future).
>
> Karma is often misunderstood as fate, destiny, or predetermination. Fate, destiny or predetermination has specific terminology in Sanskrit and is called Prarabdha.
>
> The concept of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism), as well as Taoism. In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life as well as the nature and quality of future lives—one's saṃsāra.
>
> Many New Agers believe in karma, treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.
