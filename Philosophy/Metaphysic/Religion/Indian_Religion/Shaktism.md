> **Shaktism** (Sanskrit: शाक्तसम्प्रदायः, romanized: Śāktasampradāyaḥ) 
> is a major Hindu denomination in which the metaphysical reality or the deity 
> is considered metaphorically to be a woman.
>
> In Shaktism, the divine feminine energy, Shakti, is revered as the supreme power 
> and is personified as the Mahadevi (Great Goddess), who manifests in numerous forms, 
> with each form having distinct functions and unique attributes. 
> 
> The most prominently worshiped goddesses include Durga, 
> the fierce protector who vanquishes evil and restores cosmic order; 
> Parvati, the gentle yet powerful mother goddess of fertility, devotion, and spiritual wisdom; 
> and Kali, the primal force of time and transformation. 
> 
> Additionally, Shaktism reveres a broader pantheon, including goddesses like 
> - Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and arts; 
> - Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity; and 
> - Tripura Sundari, the goddess of beauty and grace. 
> 
> Also honoured are the various Gramadevata, local village guardian deities, 
> who protect and bless their communities. 
> Following the decline of Buddhism in India, 
> elements of Hindu and Buddhist goddess worship gradually merged, 
> culminating in the emergence of the Mahavidya, a revered group of ten fierce and esoteric goddesses central to the tantric traditions within Shaktism.

> Shaktism encompasses various tantric sub-traditions, including Vidyapitha and Kulamārga. Shaktism emphasizes intense love of the deity as more important than simple obedience, thus showing an influence of the Vaishnavaite idea of a passionate relationship between Radha and Krishna as an ideal bhava. Similarly, Shaktism influenced Vaishnavism and Shaivism. The goddess is considered the consort and energy (shakti) of the gods Vishnu and Shiva; they have their individual shaktis, Vaishnavi for Vishnu and Maheshvari for Shiva, and consorts Lakshmi and Sati/Parvati. An adherent of Shaktism is called a Shakta. In 2020, the World Religion Database (WRD) estimated that Shaktism is the third-largest Hindu sect, constituting about 305 million Hindus.

> The Sruti and Smriti texts of Hinduism form an important scriptural framework in Shaktism. Scriptures such as the Devi Mahatmya, Devi-Bhagavata Purana, Kalika Purana, and Shakta Upanishads like the Devi Upanishad are revered. In Shaktism, the Devi Mahatmya is considered to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita. The Devi (Shakti) is revered in many Hindu temples and worshipped during a number of Hindu festivals. The goddess-focused tradition and its festivals, such as the Durga Puja, are very popular in eastern India.
