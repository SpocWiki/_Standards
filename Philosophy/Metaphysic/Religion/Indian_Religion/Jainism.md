> **Jainism** ( JAY-niz-əm or  JEYE-niz-əm), also known as Jain Dharma, 
> is an Indian religion whose three main pillars are nonviolence (ahiṃsā), asceticism (aparigraha), 
> and a rejection of all simplistic and one-sided views of truth and reality (anekāntavāda). 
> 
> Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four tirthankaras, 
> supreme preachers of dharma, across the current half (avasarpiṇī) of the time cycle posited in Jain cosmology. The first tirthankara in the current cycle is Rishabhadeva, who tradition holds lived millions of years ago; the 23rd tirthankara is Parshvanatha, traditionally dated to the 9th century BCE; and the 24th tirthankara is Mahavira, who lived c. the 6th or 5th century BCE. Jainism was one of a number of Śramaṇa religions that developed in the Greater Magadha cultural region.

> Jainism is considered an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology. Central to understanding Jain philosophy is the concept of bhedavijñāna, or the clear distinction in the nature of the soul and non-soul entities. This principle underscores the innate purity and potential for liberation within every soul, distinct from the physical and mental elements that bind it to the cycle of birth and rebirth. Recognizing and internalizing this separation is essential for spiritual progress and the attainment of samyaka darśana (self realization), which marks the beginning of the aspirant's journey towards liberation.

> Jain monks take five main vows: ahiṃsā (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly lacto-vegetarian lifestyle. Parasparopagraho jīvānām (the function of souls is to help one another) is the faith's motto, and the Namokar Mantra is its most common and strongest prayer.

> Jainism is one of the oldest religions still practiced today. It has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras, which hold different views on ascetic practices, gender, and the texts considered canonical. Both sub-traditions have mendicants supported by laypersons (śrāvakas and śrāvikas). The Śvētāmbara tradition in turn has two sub-traditions: Deravasi, also known as Mandirmargis, and Sthānakavasī. The religion has between four and five million followers, known as Jains or Jainas, who reside mostly in India, where they numbered around 4.5 million at the 2011 census. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities can be found in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Japan is also home to a fast-growing community of converts. Major festivals include Paryushana and Das Lakshana, Ashtanika, Mahavir Janma Kalyanak, Akshaya Tritiya, and Diwali.
