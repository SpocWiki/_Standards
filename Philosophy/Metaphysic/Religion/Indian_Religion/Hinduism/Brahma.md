## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Brahma** (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मा, IAST: Brahmā) is a Hindu god, 
> referred to as "the Creator" within the Trimurti, 
> the trinity of supreme divinity that includes Vishnu and Shiva. 
> He is associated with creation, knowledge, and the Vedas. 
> Brahma is prominently mentioned in creation legends. 
> In some Puranas, he created himself in a golden embryo known as the Hiranyagarbha.
>
> Brahma is frequently identified with the Vedic god Prajapati. 
> During the post-Vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity and his sect existed; 
> however, by the 7th century, he had lost his significance. 
> He was also overshadowed by other major deities like Vishnu, Shiva, and Mahadevi 
> and demoted to the role of a secondary creator, who was created by the major deities.
>
> Brahma is commonly depicted as a red or golden-complexioned bearded man with four heads and hands. His four heads represent the four Vedas and are pointed to the four cardinal directions. He is seated on a lotus and his vahana (mount) is a hamsa (swan, goose or crane). According to the scriptures, Brahma created his children from his mind and thus, they are referred to as Manasaputra.
>
> In contemporary Hinduism, Brahma does not enjoy popular worship and has substantially less importance than the other two members of the Trimurti. Brahma is revered in the ancient texts, yet rarely worshipped as a primary deity in India, owing to the absence of any significant sect dedicated to his reverence. Few temples dedicated to him exist in India, the most famous being the Brahma Temple, Pushkar in Rajasthan. Some Brahma temples are found outside India, such as at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, which in turn has found immense popularity within the Thai Buddhist community.
