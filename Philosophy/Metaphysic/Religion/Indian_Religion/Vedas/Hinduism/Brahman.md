> In Hinduism, **Brahman** (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मन्; IAST: Brahman) 
> connotes the highest universal principle, the Ultimate reality of the universe. 
> 
> In the Vedic Upanishads, Brahman constitutes the fundamental reality 
> that transcends the duality of existence and non-existence. 
> It serves as the absolute ground from which time, space, and natural law emerge. 
> It represents an unchanging, eternal principle 
> that exists beyond all boundaries and constraints. 
> 
> Because it transcends all limitation, 
> Brahman ultimately defies complete description or categorization through language.
>
> In major schools of Hindu philosophy, 
> it is the non-physical, efficient, formal and final cause of all that exists. 
> It is the pervasive, infinite, eternal truth, consciousness and bliss which does not change, 
> yet is the cause of all changes. 
> Brahman as a metaphysical concept refers to the single binding unity behind diversity in all that exists.
>
> Brahman is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and it is conceptualized in Hinduism, states Paul Deussen, as the "creative principle which lies realized in the whole world". Brahman is a key concept found in the Vedas, and it is extensively discussed in the early Upanishads. The Vedas conceptualize Brahman as the Cosmic Principle. In the Upanishads, it has been variously described as Sat-cit-ānanda (truth-consciousness-bliss) and as the unchanging, permanent, Highest Reality.
>
> Brahman is discussed in Hindu texts with the concept of Atman (Sanskrit: आत्मन्, 'Self'), personal, impersonal or Para Brahman, or in various combinations of these qualities depending on the philosophical school. In dualistic schools of Hinduism such as the theistic Dvaita Vedanta, Brahman is different from Atman (Self) in each being. In non-dual schools such as the Advaita Vedanta, the substance of Brahman is identical to the substance of Atman, is everywhere and inside each living being, and there is connected spiritual oneness in all existence.
