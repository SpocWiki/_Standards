> Non-theism and atheism is commonly understood as non-acceptance or outright rejection of theism in the broadest sense of the term (i.e., non-acceptance or rejection of belief in God or gods). Related (but separate) is the claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable; a stance known as agnosticism.

> Agnostic theism is a personal belief in one or more deities along with acceptance 
> that the existence or non-existence of the deity or deities is fundamentally unknowable.
