> **Theism** is broadly defined as the belief in the existence of at least one deity. 
> 
> In common parlance, or when contrasted with deism, 
> the term often describes the philosophical conception of God that is found in classical theism—
> or the conception found in monotheism—or gods found in polytheistic religions—
> or a belief in God or gods without the rejection of revelation, as is characteristic of deism.
>
> Non-theism and atheism is commonly understood as non-acceptance or outright rejection of theism in the broadest sense of the term (i.e., non-acceptance or rejection of belief in God or gods). Related (but separate) is the claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable; a stance known as agnosticism. 
>
> Agnostic theism is a personal belief in one or more deities along with acceptance 
> that the existence or non-existence of the deity or deities is fundamentally unknowable.
>
> A 2020 Philpapers survey of professional philosophers found that 
> - 66.72% accepted or leaned towards atheism, 
> - 18.64% accepted or leaned towards theism, and 
> - 14.64% leaned towards another opinion.
