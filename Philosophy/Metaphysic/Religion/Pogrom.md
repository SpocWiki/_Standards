> A **Pogrom** is a violent riot incited with the aim of 
> massacring or expelling an ethnic or religious group, 
> usually applied to attacks on Jews. 
> 
> The term entered the English language from Russian 
> to describe late 19th- and early 20th-century attacks on Jews in the Russian Empire 
> (mostly within the Pale of Settlement). 
> 
> Retrospectively, similar attacks against Jews which occurred in other times and places 
> were renamed pogroms. 
> 
> Nowadays the word is used to describe publicly sanctioned 
> purgative attacks against non-Jewish groups as well. 
> 
> The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incident, 
> at times leading to, or culminating in, massacres.
>
> Significant pogroms in the Russian Empire included the Odessa pogroms, Warsaw pogrom (1881), Kishinev pogrom (1903), Kiev pogrom (1905), and Białystok pogrom (1906). After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, several pogroms occurred amidst the power struggles in Eastern Europe, including the Lwów pogrom (1918) and Kiev pogroms (1919).
>
> The most significant pogrom which occurred in Nazi Germany was the 1938 Kristallnacht. At least 91 Jews were killed, a further thirty thousand arrested and subsequently incarcerated in concentration camps, a thousand synagogues burned, and over seven thousand Jewish businesses destroyed or damaged. Notorious pogroms of World War II included the 1941 Farhud in Iraq, the July 1941 Iași pogrom in Romania – in which over 13,200 Jews were killed – as well as the Jedwabne pogrom in German-occupied Poland. Post-World War II pogroms included the 1945 Tripoli pogrom, the 1946 Kielce pogrom, the 1947 Aleppo pogrom, and the 1955 Istanbul pogrom.
>
> This type of violence has also occurred to other ethnic and religious minorities. Examples include the 1984 Sikh massacre in which 3,000 Sikhs were killed and the 2002 Gujarat pogrom against Indian Muslims.
