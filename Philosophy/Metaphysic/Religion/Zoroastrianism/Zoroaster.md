> Zarathushtra Spitama, more commonly known as **Zoroaster** or Zarathustra, 
> was an Iranian religious reformer who challenged the tenets of the contemporary Ancient Iranian religion, 
> becoming the spiritual founder of Zoroastrianism. 
> 
> Variously described as a sage or a wonderworker; in the oldest Zoroastrian scriptures, the Gathas, 
> which he is believed to have authored, he is described as a preacher and a poet-prophet. 
> He also had an impact on Heraclitus, Plato, Pythagoras, and the Abrahamic religions, 
> including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
>
> He spoke an Eastern Iranian language, named Avestan by scholars 
> after the corpus of Zoroastrian religious texts written in that language. 
> Based on this, it is tentative to place his homeland somewhere in the eastern regions of Greater Iran 
> (perhaps in modern-day Afghanistan or Tajikistan), but his exact birthplace is uncertain.
>
> His life is traditionally dated to sometime around the 7th and 6th centuries BC, 
> making him a contemporary of Cyrus the Great, though most scholars, 
> using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence, suggest a dating to somewhere in the second millennium BC. 
> 
> Zoroastrianism eventually became Iran's most prominent religion from around the 6th century BC, 
> enjoying official sanction during the time of the Sassanid Empire, 
> until the 7th century AD, when the religion itself began to decline 
> following the Arab-Muslim conquest of Iran. 
> 
> Zoroaster is credited with authorship of the Gathas as well as the Yasna Haptanghaiti, 
> a series of hymns composed in Old Avestan that cover the core of Zoroastrian thinking. 
> 
> Little is known about Zoroaster; most of his life is known only from these scant texts. 
> By any modern standard of historiography, no evidence can place him into a fixed period 
> and the historicization surrounding him may be a part of a trend 
> from before the 10th century AD that historicizes legends and myths.
