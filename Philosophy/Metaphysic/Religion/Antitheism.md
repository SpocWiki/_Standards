> **Antitheism**, also spelled anti-theism, is the philosophical position that theism should be opposed. The term has had a range of applications. In secular contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any deity. Unlike antireligion, antitheism is not against those religions that do not have deities, such as some sects of Buddhism and Jainism.
