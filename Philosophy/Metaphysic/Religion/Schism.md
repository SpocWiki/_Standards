> A **Schism** (SIZ-əm, SKIZ-əm or, less commonly,  SHIZ-əm) is a division between people, 
> usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. 
> 
> The word is most frequently applied to a split 
> in what had previously been a single religious body, 
> such as the Great East–West Schism or the Western Schism. 
> 
> It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, 
> of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc.
>
> A schismatic is a person who creates or incites schism in an organization 
> or who is a member of a splinter group. 
> Schismatic as an adjective means pertaining to a schism or schisms, 
> or to those ideas, policies, etc. that are thought to lead towards or promote schism.
>
> In religion, the charge of schism is distinguished from that of heresy, 
> since the offence of schism concerns not differences of belief or doctrine 
> but promotion of, or the state of division, 
> especially among groups with differing pastoral jurisdictions and authority. 
> 
> However, schisms frequently involve mutual accusations of heresy, 
> and also that of the Great Apostasy. 
> 
> In Roman Catholic teaching, every heresy is a schism, 
> while there may be some schisms free of the added guilt of heresy. 
> 
> Liberal Protestantism, however, has often preferred heresy over schism. 
> 
> Presbyterian scholar James I. McCord (quoted with approval by the Episcopalian Bishop of Virginia, Peter Lee) drew a distinction between them, teaching:  
> "If you must make a choice between heresy and schism, always choose heresy. As a schismatic, you have torn and divided the body of Christ. Choose heresy every time."
