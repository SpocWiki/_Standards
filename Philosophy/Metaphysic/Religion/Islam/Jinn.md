## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Jinn** (Arabic: جِنّ‎), also romanized as djinn or anglicized as genies, 
> are supernatural beings in pre-Islamic Arabian religion and Islam. 
> Like humans, they are accountable for their deeds 
> and can be either believers (Mu'minun) or unbelievers (kuffar), 
> depending on whether they accept God's guidance.
>
> Since jinn are neither innately evil nor innately good, 
> Islam acknowledged spirits from other religions 
> and could adapt them during its expansion. 
> 
> Likewise, jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept; 
> they may represent several pagan beliefs integrated into Islam. 
> Islam places jinn and humans on the same plane in relation to God, 
> with both being subject to divine judgement and an afterlife. 
> The Quran condemns the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of worshipping or seeking protection from them.
>
> While they are naturally invisible, 
> jinn are supposed to be composed of thin and subtle bodies (أَجْسَام, ajsām) 
> and are capable of shapeshifting, usually choosing to appear as snakes, 
> but also as scorpions, lizards, or humans. 
> 
> A jinn's interaction with a human may be negative, positive, or neutral; 
> and can range from casual to highly intimate, 
> even involving sexual activity and the production of hybrid offspring. 
> However, they rarely meddle in human affairs, preferring instead to live among their own 
> in a societal arrangement similar to that of the Arabian tribes. 
> Upon being disturbed or harmed by humans, they usually retaliate in kind, 
> with the most drastic interactions leading them to possess the assailant's body, thus requiring exorcism.
>
> Individual jinn appear on charms and talismans. 
> They are called upon for protection or magical aid, often under the leadership of a king. 
> Many people who believe in jinn wear amulets to protect themselves against their assaults, 
> as they may be called upon by sorcerers and witches to cause harm. 
> 
> A commonly held belief is that jinn cannot hurt someone 
> who wears something with the name of God (الله, Allāh) written on it. 
> These folkloric beliefs and practices, although especially common throughout the Muslim world 
> in the past, have been met with increasing disapproval due to their association with idolatry.
