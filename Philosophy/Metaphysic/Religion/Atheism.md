> **Atheism**, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities. 
> Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist. 
> In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. 
> Atheism is contrasted with theism, which is the belief that at least one deity exists.
>
> Historically, evidence of atheistic viewpoints 
> can be traced back to classical antiquity and early Indian philosophy. 
> 
> In the Western world, atheism declined after Christianity gained prominence. 
> The 16th century and the Age of Enlightenment marked the resurgence of atheistic thought in Europe. 
> Atheism achieved a significant position worldwide in the 20th century. 
> Estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a god range from 500 million to 1.1 billion people. 
> Atheist organizations have defended the autonomy of science, freedom of thought, secularism, 
> and secular ethics.
>
> Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social approaches. 
> Rationales for not believing in deities include the lack of evidence, the problem of evil, 
> the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, 
> and the argument from nonbelief. 
> 
> Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism 
> and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities; 
> therefore, they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods 
> but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.
