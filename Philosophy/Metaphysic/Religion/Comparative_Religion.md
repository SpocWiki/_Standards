> Comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions  
> with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices, 
> themes and impacts (including migration) of the world's religions. 
> 
> In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding 
> of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics 
> and the nature and forms of salvation. 
> 
> It also considers and compares the origins and similarities 
> shared between the various religions of the world. 
> 
> Studying such material facilitates a broadened and more sophisticated understanding 
> of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine.
>
> In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification of the main world religions 
> distinguishes groups such as 
> - Middle Eastern religions (including Abrahamic religions and Iranian religions),
