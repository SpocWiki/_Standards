> A **Sect** is a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system, 
> typically emerging as an offshoot of a larger organization. 
> 
> Originally, the term referred specifically to religious groups 
> that had separated from a main body, 
> but it can now apply to any group that diverges from a larger organization 
> to follow a distinct set of beliefs and practices. 
> 
> Sects often form when there is a perception of heresy 
> either within the subgroup or from the larger group.
>
> In an Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition.
