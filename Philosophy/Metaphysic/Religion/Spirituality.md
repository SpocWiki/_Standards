## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The meaning of **Spirituality** has developed and expanded over time, 
> and various meanings can be found alongside each other. 
> 
> Traditionally, spirituality referred to a religious process of re-formation which 
> "aims to recover the original shape of man", oriented at "the image of God" 
> as exemplified by the founders and sacred texts of the religions of the world. 
> 
> The term was used within early Christianity to refer to a life oriented toward the Holy Spirit 
> and broadened during the Late Middle Ages to include mental aspects of life.
>
> In modern times, the term has spread to other religious traditions. 
> It broadened to refer to a wider range of experiences, 
> including a range of esoteric and religious traditions. 
> 
> Modern usages tend to refer to a subjective experience of a sacred dimension, 
> and the "deepest values and meanings by which people live", 
> often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. 
> 
> This may involve belief in a supernatural realm beyond the ordinarily observable world, 
> personal growth, a quest for an ultimate or sacred meaning, 
> religious experience,  or an encounter with one's own "inner dimension" or spirit.
