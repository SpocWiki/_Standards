# [[Reincarnation]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Reincarnation**, also known as rebirth or transmigration, 
> is the philosophical or religious concept that the non-physical essence of a living being 
> begins a new lifespan in a different physical form or body after biological death. 
> 
> In most beliefs involving reincarnation, the soul of a human being is immortal 
> and does not disperse after the physical body has perished. 
> 
> Upon death, the soul merely transmigrates into a newborn baby 
> or into an animal to continue its immortality. 
> (The term "transmigration" means the passing of a soul from one body to another after death.)

> Reincarnation (punarjanman) is a central tenet of Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In various forms, it occurs as an esoteric belief in many streams of Judaism, in certain pagan religions (including Wicca), and in some beliefs of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and of Aboriginal Australians (though most believe in an afterlife or spirit world). Some ancient Greek historical figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato, expressed belief in the soul's rebirth or migration (metempsychosis).
>
> Although the majority of denominations within the Abrahamic religions do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Catharism, Alawites, Hasidic Judaism, the Druze, Kabbalistics, Rastafarians, and the Rosicrucians. Recent scholarly research has explored the historical relations between different sects and their beliefs about reincarnation. This research includes the views of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manichaenism, and the Gnosticism of the Roman era, as well as those in Indian religions. In recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation, and contemporary works sometimes mention the topic.
