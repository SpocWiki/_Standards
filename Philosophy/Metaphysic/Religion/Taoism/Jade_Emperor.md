> In the myths and folk religion of Chinese culture, the Jade Emperor or Yudi 
> is one of the representations of the primordial god.
>
> In Taoist theology, he is the assistant of Yuanshi Tianzun, 
> who is one of the Three Pure Ones, the three primordial emanations of the Tao. 
> 
> However, some Taoists in history were skeptical of his benevolence because his buildings and infrastructure in heaven and earth were sometimes seen as interfering with the many natural laws or dao.
>
> He is often identified with Śakra in Chinese Buddhist cosmology and identified with Yu the Great in Chinese mythology.
>
> The Jade Emperor is known by many names, including Yu, Heavenly Grandfather (天公, Tiāngōng), which originally meant "Heavenly Duke", which is used by commoners; the Jade Lord; the Highest Emperor; Great Emperor of Jade (玉皇上帝 Yu Huang Shangdi, or 玉皇大帝 Yu Huang Dadi).
