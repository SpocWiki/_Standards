## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Fundamentalism** is a tendency among certain groups and individuals 
> that are characterized by the application of 
> a strict literal interpretation to scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, 
> along with a strong belief in the importance of distinguishing one's ingroup and outgroup,
> which leads to an emphasis on some conception of "purity", 
> and a desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. 
> 
> The term is usually used in the context of religion 
> to indicate an unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs (the "fundamentals").
>
> The term "fundamentalism" is generally regarded by scholars of religion 
> as referring to a largely modern religious phenomenon which, 
> while itself a reinterpretation of religion as defined by the parameters of modernism, 
> reifies religion in reaction against modernist, secularist, liberal and ecumenical tendencies 
> developing in religion and society in general 
> that it perceives to be foreign to a particular religious tradition. 
> 
> Depending upon the context, the label "fundamentalism" can be a pejorative 
> rather than a neutral characterization, similar to the ways that 
> calling political perspectives "right-wing" or "left-wing" can have negative connotations.
