> **Zoroastrianism** (Persian: دین زرتشتی Dīn-e Zartoshtī), also called Mazdayasna 
> (Avestan: 𐬨𐬀𐬰𐬛𐬀𐬌𐬌𐬀𐬯𐬥𐬀 Mazdaiiasna) or Behdin (بهدین behdīn), 
> is an Iranian religion centred on the Avesta and the teachings of Zarathushtra Spitama, 
> who is more commonly referred to by the Greek translation, Zoroaster (Greek: Ζωροάστρις Zōroastris). 
> 
> Among the world's oldest organized faiths, its adherents exalt an uncreated, benevolent, 
> and all-wise deity known as Ahura Mazda (𐬀𐬵𐬎𐬭𐬀⸱𐬨𐬀𐬰𐬛𐬁), 
> who is hailed as the supreme being of the universe. 
> 
> Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (𐬀𐬢𐬭𐬀⸱𐬨𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬌𐬌𐬎), 
> who is personified as a destructive spirit and the adversary of all things that are good. 
> 
> As such, the Zoroastrian religion combines a dualistic cosmology of good and evil 
> with an eschatological outlook predicting the ultimate triumph of Ahura Mazda over evil. 
> Opinions vary among scholars as to 
> whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or a combination of all three. 
> 
> Zoroastrianism shaped Iranian culture and history, 
> while scholars differ on whether it significantly influenced ancient Western philosophy 
> and the Abrahamic religions, or gradually reconciled with other religions and traditions, 
> such as Christianity and Islam.
>
> Originating from Zoroaster's reforms of the ancient Iranian religion, 
> Zoroastrianism began during the Avestan period (possibly as early as the 2nd millennium BCE), 
> but was first recorded in the mid-6th century BCE. 
> 
> For the following millennium, it was the official religion of successive Iranian polities, 
> beginning with the Achaemenid Empire, 
> which formalized and institutionalized many of its tenets and rituals, 
> and ending with the Sasanian Empire, which revitalized the faith and standardized its teachings. 
> 
> In the 7th century CE, the rise of Islam and the ensuing Muslim conquest of Iran 
> marked the beginning of the decline of Zoroastrianism. 
> 
> The persecution of Zoroastrians by the early Muslims in the nascent Rashidun Caliphate 
> prompted much of the community to migrate to the Indian subcontinent, 
> where they were granted asylum and became the progenitors of today's Parsis. 
> 
> Once numbering in the millions, 
> the world's total Zoroastrian population is estimated to comprise between 110,000 and 120,000 people, 
> with most of them residing either in India (50,000–60,000), in Iran (15,000–25,000), 
> or in North America (22,000). 
> The religion is declining due to restrictions on conversion, strict endogamy, and low birth rates.
>
> The central beliefs and practices of Zoroastrianism are contained in the Avesta, 
> a compendium of sacred texts assembled over several centuries. 
> 
> Its oldest and most central component are the Gathas, 
> purported to be the direct teachings of Zoroaster and his account of conversations with Ahura Mazda. 
> These writings are part of a major section of the Avesta called the Yasna, 
> which forms the core of Zoroastrian liturgy. 
> 
> Zoroaster's religious philosophy divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian paganism 
> into emanations of the natural world—the ahura and the daeva; 
> the former class consisting of divinities to be revered 
> and the latter class consisting of divinities to be rejected and condemned. 
> 
> Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator and sustaining force of the universe, 
> working in gētīg (the visible material realm) and mēnōg (the invisible spiritual and mental realm) 
> through the Amesha Spenta, a class of seven divine entities 
> that represent various aspects of the universe and the highest moral good. 
> 
> Emanating from Ahura Mazda is Spenta Mainyu (the Holy or Bountiful Spirit), 
> the source of life and goodness, 
> which is opposed by Angra Mainyu (the Destructive or Opposing Spirit), 
> who is born from Aka Manah (evil thought). 
> Angra Mainyu was further developed by Middle Persian literature into Ahriman (𐭠𐭧𐭫𐭬𐭭𐭩), 
> Ahura Mazda's direct adversary.
>
> Zoroastrian doctrine holds that, within this cosmic dichotomy, 
> human beings have the choice between Asha (truth, cosmic order), 
> the principle of righteousness or "rightness" that is promoted and embodied by Ahura Mazda, 
> and Druj (falsehood, deceit), the essential nature of Angra Mainyu 
> that expresses itself as greed, wrath, and envy. 
> 
> Thus, the central moral precepts of the religion are 
> - good thoughts (hwnata), 
> - good words (hakhta), and 
> - good deeds (hvarshta), 
> which are recited in many prayers and ceremonies. 
> 
> Many of the practices and beliefs of ancient Iranian religion can still be seen in Zoroastrianism, 
> such as reverence for nature and its elements, such as water (aban). 
> Fire (atar) is held by Zoroastrians to be particularly sacred as a symbol of Ahura Mazda himself, 
> serving as a focal point of many ceremonies and rituals, 
> and serving as the basis for Zoroastrian places of worship, which are known as fire temples.
