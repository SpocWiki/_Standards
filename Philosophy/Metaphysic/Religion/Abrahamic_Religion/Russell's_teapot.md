> **Russell's teapot** is an analogy, formulated by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872â€“1970), 
> to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making empirically unfalsifiable claims, 
> as **opposed to shifting the burden of disproof to others**.
>
> Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion. 
> He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, 
> that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, 
> he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong.
>
> The analogy has been criticised by philosophers Brian Garvey, Peter van Inwagen and Alvin Plantinga 
> as to its validity regarding religion. 
> 
> Russell's teapot has given rise to similar analogies as well as being used in parodies of religion.
