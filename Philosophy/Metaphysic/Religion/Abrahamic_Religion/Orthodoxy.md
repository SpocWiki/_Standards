> **Orthodoxy** (from Ancient Greek  ὀρθοδοξία (orthodoxía) 'righteous/correct opinion') 
> is adherence to a purported "correct" or otherwise mainstream- 
> or classically accepted creed, especially in religion.   
>
> Orthodoxy within Christianity refers to acceptance of the doctrines 
> defined by various creeds and ecumenical councils in antiquity, 
> but different Churches accept different creeds and councils. 
> 
> Such differences of opinion have developed for numerous reasons, 
> including language and cultural barriers. 
> In the Christian world, Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy 
> are sometimes referred to simply as "the Orthodox" or "Orthodoxy". 
>
> In some English-speaking countries, Jews who adhere to all the contemporarily-applicable commandments legislated in the Written and Oral Torah are often called Orthodox Jews. 
> As this can include many Jews that may not necessarily identify with the term "Orthodox", 
> such as many Masorti Jews, Jewish communities that consider themselves Orthodox 
> are normally united through a diverse, but shared Hashkafic origin from the period of 1818-1821. 
>
> Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as "Orthodox Islam".
