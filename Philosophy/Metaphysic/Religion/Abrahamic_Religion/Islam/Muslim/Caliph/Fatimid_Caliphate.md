> The Fatimid Caliphate (; Arabic: الخلافة الفاطمیّة, romanized: al-Khilāfa al-Fāṭimiyya), 
> also known as the Fatimid Empire, was a caliphate extant from the tenth to the twelfth centuries CE 
> under the rule of the Fatimids, an Isma'ili Shi'a dynasty. 
> 
> Spanning a large area of North Africa and West Asia, 
> it ranged from the western Mediterranean in the west to the Red Sea in the east. 
> 
> The Fatimids traced their ancestry to the Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatima and her husband Ali, 
> the first Shi'a imam. 
> 
> The Fatimids were acknowledged as the rightful imams by different Isma'ili communities 
> as well as by denominations in many other Muslim lands and adjacent regions. 
> Originating during the Abbasid Caliphate, 
> the Fatimids initially conquered Ifriqiya (roughly present-day Tunisia and north-eastern Algeria). 
> They extended their rule across the Mediterranean coast and ultimately made Egypt the center of the caliphate. 
> At its height, the caliphate included—in addition to Egypt—
> varying areas of the Maghreb, Sicily, the Levant, and the Hejaz.
>
> Between 902 and 909, 
> the foundation of the Fatimid state was realized under the leadership of da'i (missionary) Abu Abdallah, 
> whose conquest of Aghlabid Ifriqiya with the help of Kutama forces 
> paved the way for the establishment of the Caliphate. 
> 
> After the conquest, Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah was retrieved from Sijilmasa 
> and then accepted as the Imam of the movement, becoming the first Caliph and founder of the dynasty in 909. 
> 
> In 921, the city of al-Mahdiyya was established as the capital. 
> In 948, they shifted their capital to al-Mansuriyya, near Kairouan. 
> In 969, during the reign of al-Mu'izz, they conquered Egypt, 
> and in 973, the caliphate was moved to the newly founded Fatimid capital of Cairo. 
> 
> Egypt became the political, cultural, and religious centre of the empire 
> and it developed a new and "indigenous Arabic culture". 
> 
> After its initial conquests, 
> the caliphate often allowed a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Shi'a sects of Islam, 
> as well as to Jews and Christians. 
> However, its leaders made little headway in persuading the Egyptian population to adopt its religious beliefs.
>
> After the reigns of al-'Aziz and al-Hakim, 
> the long reign of al-Mustansir entrenched a regime in which the caliph remained aloof from state affairs 
> and viziers took on greater importance. 
> 
> Political and ethnic factionalism within the army led to a civil war in the 1060s, 
> which threatened the empire's survival. 
> 
> After a period of revival during the tenure of the vizier Badr al-Jamali, 
> the Fatimid caliphate declined rapidly during the late eleventh and twelfth centuries. 
> 
> In addition to internal difficulties, the caliphate was weakened 
> - by the encroachment of the Seljuk Turks into Syria in the 1070s 
> - and the arrival of the Crusaders in the Levant in 1097. 
> 
> In 1171, Saladin abolished the dynasty's rule and founded the Ayyubid dynasty, 
> which incorporated Egypt back into the nominal sphere of authority of the Abbasid Caliphate.
