> Abd Allah ibn Abi Quhafa (c. 573 – 23 August 634), better known by his kunya **Abu Bakr**, 
> was a senior companion, the closest friend, and father-in-law of Muhammad. 
> He served as the first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, ruling from 632 until his death in 634. 
> Abu Bakr was granted the honorific title aṣ-Ṣiddīq (lit. the Veracious) by Muhammad, 
> a designation that continues to be used by Sunni Muslims to this day.
>
> Born to Abu Quhafa and Umm al-Khayr of the Banu Taym, 
> Abu Bakr was amongst the earliest converts to Islam and propagated dawah to the Mushrikites. 
> He was considered the first Muslim missionary 
> as several companions of Muhammad converted through Abu Bakr. 
> He accompanied Muhammad on his migration to Medina and became one of his bodyguards. 
> Abu Bakr participated in all of Muhammad's campaigns and served as the first amir al-hajj in 631. 
> In the absence of Muhammad, Abu Bakr led the prayers.
>
> Following Muhammad's death in 632, 
> Abu Bakr succeeded the leadership of the Muslim community as the first caliph, being elected at Saqifa. 
> His election was contested by a number of rebellious tribal leaders. 
> During his reign, he overcame a number of uprisings, collectively known as the Ridda wars, 
> as a result of which he was able to consolidate 
> and expand the rule of the Muslim state over the entire Arabian Peninsula. 
> 
> He also commanded the initial incursions into the neighbouring Sasanian and Byzantine empires, 
> which in the years following his death, would eventually result in the Muslim conquests of Persia and the Levant. 
> Apart from politics, Abu Bakr is also credited for the compilation of the Quran, 
> of which he had a personal caliphal codex. 
> 
> Prior to dying in August 634, Abu Bakr nominated Umar (r. 634–644) as his successor. 
> Along with Muhammad, Abu Bakr is buried in the Green Dome at the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, 
> the second holiest site in Islam. 
> He died of illness after a reign of 2 years, 2 months and 14 days, the only Rashidun caliph to die of natural causes.
>
> Though Abu Bakr's reign was brief, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time, 
> the Sassanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire. 
> 
> He set in motion a historical trajectory that, within a few decades, 
> would lead to the establishment of one of the largest empires in history. 
> 
> His decisive victory over the local Arab rebel forces marks a significant chapter in Islamic history. 
> [[../../../../../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/War/Palestine-Wars/Sunni-Islam|Sunni-Islam]] tradition revere Abu Bakr as the first of the Rashidun caliphs 
> and the greatest individual after the prophets and messengers. 
> 
> [[../../../../../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/War/Palestine-Wars/Shia-Islam|Shia-Islam]] tradition views Abu Bakr as an usurper of the caliphate and an adversary of the ahl al-bayt.
