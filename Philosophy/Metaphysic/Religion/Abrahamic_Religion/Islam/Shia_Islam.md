> Shia Islam is the second-largest branch of Islam. 
> It holds that Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib (r. 656–661) 
> as both his political successor (caliph) and as the spiritual leader of the Muslim community (imam). 
> 
> However, his right is understood to have been usurped 
> by a number of Muhammad's companions at the meeting of Saqifa, 
> during which they appointed Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) as caliph instead. 
> 
> As such, Sunni Muslims believe Abu Bakr, Umar (r. 634–644), Uthman (r. 644–656) and Ali to be 'rightly-guided caliphs', 
> whereas Shia Muslims regard only Ali as the legitimate successor.
>
> Shia Muslims believe that the imamate continued through Ali's sons, Hasan and Husayn, 
> after which various Shia branches developed and recognized different imams. 
> 
> They revere the ahl al-bayt, the family of Muhammad, 
> maintaining that they possess divine knowledge. 
> 
> Shia holy sites include the shrine of Ali in Najaf, the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, 
> and other mausoleums of the ahl al-bayt. 
> 
> Later events, such as Husayn's martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala (680 CE), 
> further influenced the development of Shia Islam, 
> contributing to the formation of a distinct religious sect with its own rituals and shared collective memory.
>
> Shia Islam is followed by 10–15% of all Muslims, numbering at an estimated 200–300 million followers worldwide as of 2025. The three main Shia branches are Twelverism, Isma'ilism, and Zaydism. Shia Muslims form a majority of the population in Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan, as well as about half of the citizen population of Bahrain. Significant Shia communities are also found in Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent. Iran stands as the world's only country where Shia Islam forms the foundation of both its laws and governance system.
