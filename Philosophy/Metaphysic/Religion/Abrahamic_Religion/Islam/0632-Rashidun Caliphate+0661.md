> The **Rashidun Caliphate** (Arabic: ٱلْخِلَافَةُ ٱلرَّاشِدَةُ, romanized: al-Khilāfah ar-Rāšidah) 
> is a title given for the reigns of the first caliphs (lit. "successors") — 
> Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali collectively — 
> believed to represent the perfect Islam and governance 
> who led the Muslim community and polity 
> from the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (in 632 AD), 
> to the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate (in 661 AD). 
> 
> The reign of these four caliphs is considered in Islam to have been "rightly-guided", 
> meaning that it constitutes a model to be followed 
> and emulated from a religious point of view. 
> 
> This term is not used by Shia Muslims, 
> who make up 10–15% of the global Muslim population, 
> as they reject the rule of the first three caliphs as illegitimate.
>
> Following Muhammad's death in June 632, 
> Muslim leaders debated who should succeed him. 
> 
> Unlike later caliphs, Rashidun were often chosen by some form of a small group of high-ranking companions of the Prophet in shūrā (lit. 'consultation') or appointed by their predecessor. 
> 
> Muhammad's close companion Abu Bakr (r. 632–634), of the Banu Taym clan, 
> was elected the first caliph in Medina and began the re-conquest of the Arabian Peninsula. 
> 
> The only Rashidun not to die by assassination, 
> he was succeeded by Umar (r. 634–644), his appointed successor from the Banu Adi clan. 
> Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, 
> conquering more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire 
> and nearly the entire Sasanian Empire.
>
> After Umar's assassination, Uthman (r. 644–656), a member of the Umayyad clan, 
> was chosen as caliph. 
> 
> He concluded the conquest of Persia in 651 
> and continued expeditions into the Byzantine territories. 
> 
> Uthman was assassinated in June 656 and succeeded by Ali (r. 656–661), 
> a member of the Banu Hashim clan, who transferred the capital to Kufa. 
> 
> Ali presided over the civil war called the First Fitna as his suzerainty 
> was unrecognized by Uthman's kinsman and Syria's governor Mu'awiya ibn Abu Sufyan (r. 661–680), who believed that Uthman's murderers should be punished immediately. 
> 
> Additionally, a third faction known as Kharijites, who were former supporters of Ali, 
> rebelled against both Ali and Mu'awiya 
> after refusing to accept the arbitration in the Battle of Siffin. 
> 
> The war led to the overthrow of the Rashidun Caliphate 
> and the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661 by Mu'awiya.
