> A **Caliph**ate (Arabic: خلافة, romanized: khilāfa [xiˈlaːfa]) is an institution or public office 
> under the leadership of an Islamic steward with the title of caliph (; خليفة khalīfa [xaˈliːfa], ), 
> a person considered a political–religious successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad 
> and a leader of the entire Muslim world (ummah). 
> Historically, the caliphates were polities based on Islam which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.
>
> During the medieval period, three major caliphates succeeded each other: 
> - the Rashidun Caliphate (632–661), 
> - the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), and 
> - the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1517). 
> In the fourth major caliphate, the Ottoman Caliphate, 
> the rulers of the Ottoman Empire claimed caliphal authority from 1517 
> until the Ottoman caliphate was formally abolished as part of the 1924 secularisation of Turkey. 
> 
> The Sharif of Mecca then claimed the title, 
> but this caliphate fell quickly after its conquest by the Sultanate of Nejd 
> (the predecessor of modern-day Saudi Arabia), leaving the claim in dormancy. 
> Throughout the history of Islam, a few other Muslim states, 
> almost all of which were hereditary monarchies, have claimed to be caliphates.
>
> Not all Muslim states have had caliphates. 
> The Sunni branch of Islam stipulates that, as a head of state, 
> a caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives. 
> 
> Shia Muslims, however, believe a caliph should be 
> an imam chosen by God from the Ahl al-Bayt (the "Household of the Prophet"). 
> 
> Some caliphates in history have been led by Shia Muslims, like the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171). 
> 
> From the late 20th century towards the early 21st century, 
> in the wake of the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR, 
> the war on terror and the Arab Spring, 
> various Islamist groups have claimed the caliphate, 
> although these claims have usually been widely rejected among Muslims.
