> **Gnosticism** (from Ancient Greek: γνωστικός, romanized: gnōstikós, Koine Greek: [ɣnostiˈkos], "having knowledge") 
> is a collection of religious and philosophical ideas and systems 
> that coalesced in the late first century AD among early Christian sects and the sects of other religions. 
> 
> These diverse groups were concerned with basic questions of existence 
> and emphasized personal spiritual knowledge (gnosis) 
> above the proto-orthodox teachings, traditions, and authority of religious institutions. 
> 
> Gnostics generally believed in a supreme being, the Monad, who emanates divine beings; 
> one, Sophia, creates the flawed demiurge who makes the material world, 
> trapping souls until they regain divine knowledge. 
> 
> Consequently, Gnostics considered material existence flawed or evil 
> and held the principal element of salvation to be direct knowledge of the hidden divinity, 
> attained via mystical or esoteric insight. 
> Many Gnostic texts deal not in concepts of sin and repentance, but with illusion and enlightenment.
>
> Although the exact origins of Gnosticism cannot be traced, 
> it likely originated in the late first and early second centuries around Alexandria, 
> influenced by Jewish-Christian sects, 
> 
> Hellenistic Judaism, Middle Platonism, and diverse religious ideas; 
> scholars debate whether it arose as an intra-Christian movement, 
> from Jewish mystical traditions, or from other sources. 
> 
> Gnostic writings flourished among certain Christian groups in the Mediterranean world 
> around the second century, when the Early Church Fathers denounced them as heresy. 
> Efforts to destroy these texts were largely successful, 
> resulting in the survival of very little writing by Gnostic theologians. 
> 
> Nonetheless, early Gnostic teachers such as Valentinus saw themselves as Christians. 
> Gnostic views of Jesus varied, seeing him as a divine revealer, enlightened human, 
> spirit without a body, false messiah, or one among several saviors.
>
> Judean–Israelite Gnosticism, including the Mandaeans and Elkesaites, 
> blended Jewish-Christian ideas with Gnostic beliefs focused on baptism 
> and the cosmic struggle between light and darkness, 
> with the Mandaeans still practicing ritual purity today. 
> 
> Syriac–Egyptian groups like Sethianism and Valentinianism 
> combined Platonic philosophy and Christian themes, 
> seeing the material world as flawed but not wholly evil. 
> 
> Other traditions include the Basilideans, Marcionites, Thomasines, 
> and Manichaeism, known for its cosmic dualism. 
> 
> After declining in the Mediterranean, Gnosticism persisted near the Byzantine Empire 
> and resurfaced in medieval Europe with groups like the Paulicians, Bogomils, and Cathars, 
> who were accused of Gnostic traits. 
> 
> Islamic and medieval Kabbalistic thought also reflect some Gnostic ideas, 
> while modern revivals and discoveries such as the Nag Hammadi texts 
> have influenced numerous thinkers and churches up to the present day.
>
> Before the 1945 discovery of the Nag Hammadi library, 
> knowledge of Gnosticism came mainly from biased and incomplete heresiological writings; 
> the recovered Gnostic texts revealed a very diverse and complex early Christian landscape. 
> 
> Some scholars say Gnosticism may contain historical information about 
> Jesus from the Gnostic viewpoint, although the majority conclude 
> that apocryphal sources, Gnostic or not, are later than the canonical sources 
> and many, such as the Gospel of Thomas, depended on or used the Synoptic Gospels. 
> 
> Elaine Pagels has noted the influence of sources from Hellenistic Judaism, 
> Zoroastrianism, and Middle Platonism on the Nag Hammadi texts. 
> 
> Academic studies of Gnosticism have evolved from viewing it as a Christian heresy 
> or Greek-influenced aberration to recognizing it as a diverse set of movements 
> with complex Jewish, Persian, and philosophical roots; 
> consequently, modern scholars question the usefulness of "Gnosticism" as a unified category 
> and favor more precise classifications based on texts, traditions, and socio-religious contexts.
