> The [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] (FSM) is the deity of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or **Pastafari**anism, 
> a parodic new religious movement that promotes a light-hearted view of religion. 
> 
> The parody originated in opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools in the United States. 
> According to adherents, Pastafarianism (a portmanteau of pasta and Rastafarianism) 
> is a "real, legitimate religion, as much as any other". It has received some limited recognition as such.
>
> The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter 
> written by Bobby Henderson in 2005 to protest the Kansas State Board of Education decision 
> to permit teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in state school science classes. 
> 
> In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying Spaghetti Monsterism", 
> alongside intelligent design and evolution. 
> 
> After Henderson published the letter on his website, 
> the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an Internet phenomenon 
> and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in state schools.
>
> Pastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented on 
> Henderson's Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster website (where he is described as "prophet"), 
> and are also elucidated in The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, written by Henderson in 2006, 
> and in The Loose Canon, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 
> 
> The central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster 
> created the universe after drinking heavily. 
> Pirates are revered as the original Pastafarians. 
> 
> The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas about 
> and sightings of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and display crafts representing images of it.
>
> Because of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as 
> a more modern version of Russell's teapotâ€”
> an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make unfalsifiable claims, 
> not on those who reject them. 
> 
> Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in Polk County, Florida, where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. There are reported to be tens of thousands of Pastafarians, primarily located in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
