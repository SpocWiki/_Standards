## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Christian philosophy includes philosophies carried out by Christians 
> or in relation to the religion of Christianity. 
> 
> Christian philosophy emerged with the aim of reconciling science and faith, 
> starting from natural rational explanations with the help of Christian revelation. 
> Several thinkers such as Origen and Augustine of Hippo believed 
> that there was a harmonious relationship between science and faith, 
> others such as Tertullian claimed that there was contradiction; others tried to differentiate them.
>
> There are scholars who question the existence of a Christian philosophy itself. 
> These claim that there is no originality in Christian thought, 
> and its concepts and ideas are inherited from Greek philosophy. 
> 
> Thus, Christian philosophy would protect philosophical thought, 
> which would already be definitively elaborated by Greek philosophy. 
> 
> However, Catholic scholars Philotheus Boehner and Étienne Gilson claim 
> that Christian philosophy is not a simple repetition of ancient philosophy, 
> although they owe to Greek science the knowledge developed by Plato, Aristotle and the Neoplatonists. 
> They even claim that in Christian philosophy, Greek culture survives in organic form.
