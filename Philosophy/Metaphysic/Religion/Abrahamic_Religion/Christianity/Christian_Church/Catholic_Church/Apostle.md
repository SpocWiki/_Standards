> An **Apostle**, in its literal sense, is an emissary. 
> The word is derived from Ancient Greek ἀπόστολος (apóstolos), literally "one who is sent off", 
> itself derived from the verb ἀποστέλλειν (apostéllein), "to send off". 
> 
> The purpose of such sending off is usually to convey a message, 
> and thus "messenger" is a common alternative translation; 
> other common translations include "ambassador" and "envoy". 
> The term in Ancient Greek also has other related meanings.
>
> In Christianity, the term was used in the New Testament for Jesus' Twelve Apostles 
> (including Peter, James, and John), 
> as well as a wider group of early Christian figures, including Paul, Barnabas, and Junia. 
> 
> The term is also used to designate an important missionary of Christianity 
> to a region or a group, e.g. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, 
> or Boniface, the "apostle of the Germans". 
> 
> Some other religions use the term for comparable figures in their history. 
> The word in this sense may be used metaphorically in various contexts, 
> but is mostly found used specifically for early associates of the founder of a religion, 
> who were important in spreading their teachings. 
> 
> The term is also used to refer to someone who is a strong supporter of something.
