> **Veneration** (Latin: veneratio; Greek: τιμάω timáō), 
> refers to the practice of honoring people and articles of religious significance. 
> The term applies, for example, to the veneration of saints and the veneration of relics.
>
> To venerate a saint is honour a person who has been identified as having a high degree of sanctity or holiness. Angels are shown similar veneration in many religions. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism.
>
> Within Christianity, veneration is practiced by groups such as the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Church, all of which have varying types of canonization or glorification processes. Catholic church teaching notes that believers have "always venerated the divine Scriptures just as [they] venerate the body of the Lord". In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, veneration for saints is shown outwardly by respectfully kissing, bowing or making the sign of the cross before a saint's icon, relics, or statue, or by going on pilgrimage to sites associated with saints. The Lutheran Churches and Anglican Churches commemorate saints on feast days throughout the liturgical year and often name churches after saints. In general, the veneration of saints is not practiced by Reformed Christians and Jehovah's Witnesses, as many adherents of both groups believe the practice amounts to idolatry. 
>
> Hinduism has a long tradition of veneration of saints, expressed toward various gurus and teachers of sanctity, both living and dead. Branches of Buddhism include formal liturgical worship of saints, with Mahayana Buddhism classifying degrees of sainthood.
>
> In Islam, veneration of saints is practiced by some of the adherents of traditional Islam (Sufis, for example), and in many parts of places like Turkey, Egypt, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Other sects, such as Wahhabists etc., abhor the practice.
>
> In Judaism, there is no classical or formal recognition of saints, but there is a long history of reverence shown toward biblical heroes and martyrs. Jews in some regions, for example in Morocco, have a long and widespread tradition of saint veneration, as do Hasidic Jews.
