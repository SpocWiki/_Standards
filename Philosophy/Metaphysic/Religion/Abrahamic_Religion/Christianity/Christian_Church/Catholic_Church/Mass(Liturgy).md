> Mass is the main Eucharistic liturgical service in many forms of Western Christianity. 
> 
> The term Mass is commonly used in the Catholic Church, Western Rite Orthodoxy, 
> Old Catholicism, and Independent Catholicism. 
> The term is also used in many Lutheran churches, as well as in some Anglican churches, 
> and on rare occasion by other Protestant churches.
>
> Other Christian denominations may employ terms such as Divine Service or worship service (and often just "service"), rather than the word Mass. For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Christianity, including Eastern Catholic Churches, other terms such as Divine Liturgy, Holy Qurbana, Holy Qurobo and Badarak (or Patarag) are typically used instead.
