> Reformed Christianity, also called **Calvinism**, is a major branch of Protestantism 
> that began during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. 
> 
> In the modern day, it is largely represented by the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, 
> and Congregational traditions, as well as parts of the Anglican 
> (known as "Episcopal" in some regions), Baptist and Waldensian traditions, 
> in addition to a minority of persons belonging to the Methodist faith 
> (who are known as Calvinistic Methodists).
>
> Reformed theology emphasizes the authority of the Bible and the sovereignty of God, 
> as well as covenant theology, a framework for understanding the Bible 
> based on God's covenants with people. 
> 
> Reformed churches emphasize simplicity in worship. 
> Several forms of ecclesiastical polity are exercised by Reformed churches, 
> including presbyterian, congregational, and some episcopal. 
> Articulated by John Calvin, 
> the Reformed faith holds to a spiritual (pneumatic) presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper.
>
> Emerging in the 16th century, the Reformed tradition developed over several generations, especially in Switzerland, Scotland and the Netherlands. In the 17th century, Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants were expelled from the Dutch Reformed Church over disputes regarding predestination and salvation, and from that time Arminians are usually considered to be a distinct tradition from the Reformed. This dispute produced the Canons of Dort, the basis for the "doctrines of grace" also known as the "five points" of Calvinism.
