> The **Puritans** were English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries 
> who sought to rid the Church of England of what they 
> considered to be Roman Catholic practices, 
> maintaining that the Church of England had not been fully reformed 
> and should become more Protestant. 
> 
> Puritanism played a significant role in English and early American history, 
> especially in the Protectorate in Great Britain, and the earlier settlement of New England.
>
> Puritans were dissatisfied with the limited extent of the English Reformation 
> and with the Church of England's toleration of certain practices 
> associated with the Catholic Church. 
> 
> They formed and identified with various religious groups 
> advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine, 
> as well as personal and corporate piety. 
> 
> Puritans adopted a covenant theology, and in that sense they were Calvinists 
> (as were many of their earlier opponents). 
> 
> In church polity, Puritans were divided between supporters of episcopal, presbyterian, and congregational types. 
> 
> Some believed a uniform reform of the established church was called for 
> to create a godly nation, 
> while others advocated separation from, or the end of, any established state church 
> entirely in favour of autonomous gathered churches, called-out from the world. 
> 
> These Separatist and Independents became more prominent in the 1640s, 
> when the supporters of a presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly 
> were unable to forge a new English national church.
>
> By the late 1630s, Puritans were in alliance with the growing commercial world, 
> with the parliamentary opposition to the royal prerogative, 
> and with the Scottish Presbyterians with whom they had much in common. 
> 
> Consequently, they became a major political force in England 
> and came to power as a result of the First English Civil War (1642–1646). 
>
> Almost all Puritan clergy left the Church of England 
> after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. 
> 
> Many continued to practise their faith in nonconformist denominations, 
> especially in Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches. 
> The nature of the Puritan movement in England changed radically. 
> In New England, it retained its character for a longer period.
>
> Puritanism was never a formally defined religious division within Protestantism, 
> and the term Puritan itself was rarely used after the turn of the 18th century. 
> 
> Congregationalist Churches, widely considered to be a 
> part of the Reformed tradition of Christianity, are descended from the Puritans. 
> 
> Moreover, Puritan beliefs are enshrined in the Savoy Declaration, 
> the confession of faith held by the Congregationalist churches. 
> 
> Some Puritan ideals, including the formal rejection of Roman Catholicism, 
> were incorporated into the doctrines of the Church of England, 
> the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
