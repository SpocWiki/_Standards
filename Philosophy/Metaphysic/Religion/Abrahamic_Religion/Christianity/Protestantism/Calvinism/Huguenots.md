> The **Huguenots** ( HEW-gə-nots, UK also  -⁠nohz; French: [yɡ(ə)no]) 
> are a religious group of French Protestants 
> who held to the Reformed (Calvinist) tradition of Protestantism. 
> 
> The term, which may be derived from the name of a Swiss political leader, 
> the Genevan burgomaster Besançon Hugues, was in common use by the mid-16th century. 
> Huguenot was frequently used in reference to those of the Reformed Church of France 
> from the time of the Protestant Reformation. 
> 
> By contrast, the Protestant populations of eastern France, in Alsace, Moselle, and Montbéliard, were mainly Lutherans.
>
> In his Encyclopedia of Protestantism, Hans Hillerbrand wrote that 
> on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, 
> the Huguenot community made up as much as 10% of the French population. 
> By 1600, it declined to 7–8%, and was reduced further late in the century 
> after the return of persecution under Louis XIV, 
> who instituted the Dragonnades to forcibly convert Protestants, 
> and then finally revoked all Protestant rights in his Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685. 
> In 1686, the Protestant population sat at 1% of the population.
>
> The Huguenots were concentrated in the southern and western parts of the Kingdom of France. 
> As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew. 
> A series of religious conflicts followed, known as 
> the French Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. 
> The Huguenots were led by Jeanne d'Albret; her son, the future Henry IV 
> (who would later convert to Catholicism in order to become king); and the princes of Condé. 
> 
> The wars ended with the Edict of Nantes of 1598, 
> which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.
>
> Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s resulted in the abolition of their political and military privileges. 
> They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, 
> who gradually increased persecution of Protestantism 
> until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685). 
> This ended legal recognition of Protestantism in France 
> and the Huguenots were forced to either convert to Catholicism (possibly as Nicodemites) 
> or flee as refugees; they were subject to violent Dragonnades. 
> 
> Louis XIV claimed that the French Huguenot population was reduced 
> from about 900,000 or 800,000 adherents to just 1,000 or 1,500. 
> He exaggerated the decline, but the Dragonnades were devastating for the French Protestant community. The exodus of Huguenots from France created a brain drain, as many of them had occupied important places in society.
>
> The remaining Huguenots faced continued persecution under Louis XV. 
> By the time of his death in 1774, Calvinism had been all but eliminated from France. 
> 
> Persecution of Protestants officially ended with the Edict of Versailles, signed by Louis XVI in 1787. 
> Two years later, with the Revolutionary Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 
> 1789, Protestants gained equal rights as citizens.
