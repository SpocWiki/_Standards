> **Nontrinitarianism** is a form of Christianity that rejects the Christian theology of the Trinityâ€”
> the belief that God is three distinct hypostases or persons 
> who are coeternal, coequal, and indivisibly united in one being, or essence (from the Ancient Greek ousia). 
> 
> Certain religious groups that emerged during the Protestant Reformation 
> have historically been known as antitrinitarian.
>
> According to churches that consider the decisions of ecumenical councils final, 
> trinitarianism was definitively declared to be Christian doctrine 
> at the 4th-century ecumenical councils, that of the First Council of Nicaea (325), 
> which declared the full divinity of the Son, 
> and the First Council of Constantinople (381), which declared the divinity of the Holy Spirit.

> Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian philosophies, such as adoptionism and monarchianism, existed prior to the codification of the Trinity doctrine in AD 325, 381, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus. Nontrinitarianism was later renewed by Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the Unitarian movement during the Protestant Reformation, in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19th century.

> The doctrine of the Trinity, as held in mainstream Christianity, is not present in the other major monotheistic Abrahamic religions. Also mainstream trinitarian Christians dispute labeling nontrinitarian groups as members within Christianity.
