## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Lutheranism** or Evangelical Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestantism 
> that emerged under the work of Martin Luther, the 16th-century German friar and reformer 
> whose efforts to reform the theology and practices of the Catholic Church 
> launched the Reformation in 1517. 
> 
> The Lutheran Churches adhere to the Bible and the Ecumenical Creeds, 
> with Lutheran doctrine being explicated in the Book of Concord. 
> Lutherans hold themselves to be in continuity with the apostolic church 
> and affirm the writings of the Church Fathers and the first four ecumenical councils.
>
> The schism between Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism, 
> which was formalized in the Edict of Worms of 1521, centered on two points: 
> - the proper source of authority in the church, often called the formal principle of the Reformation, and 
> - the doctrine of justification, the material principle of Lutheran theology. 
> Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification "by Grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith. 
> 
> This contrasts with the belief of the Roman Catholic Church, defined at the Council of Trent, 
> which contends that final authority comes from both Scripture and tradition. 
> In Lutheranism, tradition is subordinate to Scripture and is cherished for its role in the proclamation of the Gospel.
>
> The Lutheran Churches retain many of the liturgical practices 
> and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Western Church, 
> with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper, 
> although Eastern Lutheranism uses the Byzantine Rite. 
> 
> Though Lutherans are not dogmatic about the number of sacraments, 
> three Lutheran sacraments are generally recognized including baptism, confession and the eucharist. 
> 
> The Lutheran Churches teach baptismal regeneration, 
> that humans "are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost". 
> 
> Lutheranism teaches that sanctification commences at the time of justification 
> and that Christians, as a result of their living faith, ought to do good works, which are rewarded by God. 
> 
> The act of mortal sin forfeits salvation, unless individuals turn back to God through faith. 
> In the Lutheran Churches, the Office of the Keys exercised through confession 
> and absolution is the "authority which Christ has given to His Church on earth: 
> to forgive the sins of the penitent sinners, but to retain the sins of the impenitent 
> as long as they do not repent." 
> 
> The doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist via a sacramental union 
> is central to the Lutheran faith, with the Mass (also known as the Divine Service) being celebrated regularly, especially on the Lord's Day. 
>
> Lutheranism became the state church of many parts of Northern Europe, starting with Prussia in 1525. 
> In Scandinavia, the Roman Catholic bishops largely accepted the Lutheran reforms 
> and the Church there became Lutheran in belief; 
> the threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons was continued. 
> Lutheran divines who contributed to the development of Lutheran theology include 
> - Martin Luther, 
> - Martin Chemnitz, 
> - Philip Melanchthon, 
> - Joachim Westphal, 
> - Laurentius Petri, 
> - Olaus Petri, and 
> - Laurentius Andreae. 
>
> Lutheranism has contributed to Christian hymnody and the arts, 
> as well as the development of education. 
> 
> Christian missions have been established by Lutherans in various regions. 
> Lutheran Churches operate a number of Lutheran schools, colleges and universities around the world, 
> in addition to hospitals and orphanages. 
> 
> A number of Lutheran religious orders, as well as monasteries and convents, 
> live in community to pray and work. 
> 
> Lutherans are found across all continents of the globe, numbering 90 million.
