> **Evangelicalism**, also called evangelical Christianity or evangelical Protestantism, 
> is a worldwide, interdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity 
> that emphasizes evangelism, or the preaching and spreading of the Christian gospel.

> The term evangelical is derived from the Koine Greek word euangelion, meaning "good news," 
> in reference to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ.

> Evangelicalism typically places a strong emphasis on personal conversion,

> The definition and scope of evangelicalism are subjects of debate among theologians and scholars. 
> Some critics argue that the term encompasses a wide and diverse range of beliefs and practices,

> The theological roots of evangelicalism can be traced to the Protestant Reformation in 16th-century Europe, particularly Martin Luther's 1517 Ninety-five Theses, which emphasized the authority of Scripture and the preaching of the gospel over church tradition. The modern evangelical movement is generally dated to around 1738, influenced by theological currents such as Pietism, Puritanism, Quakerism, and Moravianism—notably the work of Nicolaus Zinzendorf and the Herrnhut community. Evangelicalism gained momentum during the First Great Awakening, with figures like John Wesley and the early Methodists playing central roles.

> It has had a longstanding presence in the Anglosphere, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, before expanding globally in the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. The movement grew substantially during the 18th and 19th centuries, notably through the series of religious revivals known as the Great Awakening in the United States and various revival movements and reform efforts in Britain. Today, evangelicals are found across many Protestant denominations and global contexts, without being confined to a single tradition. Notable evangelical leaders have included Zinzendorf, George Fox, Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Billy Graham, Bill Bright, Harold Ockenga, Gudina Tumsa, John Stott, Francisco Olazábal, William J. Seymour, Luis Palau, Os Guinness, and Martyn Lloyd-Jones.

> As of 2016, an estimated 619 million people identified as evangelical Christians worldwide, accounting for roughly one in four Christians. In the United States, evangelicals make up about a quarter of the population and represent the largest religious group. A growing number of individuals, often referred to as exvangelicals, have left evangelicalism due to discrimination, abuse, or theological disillusionment. Evangelicalism is a transdenominational movement found across many Protestant denominations, including Reformed traditions such as Presbyterianism and Congregationalism, Anglicanism, Plymouth Brethren, Baptists, Methodism (especially in the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition), Lutheranism, Moravians, Free Church bodies, Mennonites, Quakers, Pentecostal and charismatic movements, and various non-denominational churches.
