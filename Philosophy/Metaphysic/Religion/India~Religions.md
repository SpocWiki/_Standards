All four [Dharmic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_religions "Indian religions"), viz., Jainism, [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"), [Sikhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism "Sikhism") and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), share concepts and doctrines such as [karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma "Karma") and [rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation"). 
They do not believe in eternal [heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") or [hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") or [judgment day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_day "Judgment day"), 
and leave it up to individual discretion to choose whether or not to believe in gods, 
to disagree with core teachings, and to choose whether to participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. 
They all consider values such as _[ahimsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa "Ahimsa")_ (non-violence) to be important,â€Š 
link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents, and karma, 
and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (_[moksha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha "Moksha")_).

Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. 
All believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates the premise of _[anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta "Anatta")_ ("no eternal self or soul"). 
Hinduism incorporates an eternal unchanging _[atman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atman_(Hinduism) "Atman (Hinduism)")_ ("soul"), while Jainism incorporates an eternal but changing _[jiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiva_(Jainism) "Jiva (Jainism)")_ ("soul"). 
In Jain thought, there are infinite eternal _jivas_, predominantly in cycles of rebirth, and a few _siddhas_ (perfected ones). 
Unlike Jainism, Hindu philosophies encompass [nondualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita "Advaita") where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe "soul exists" to be a self-evident truth, 
most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and constant (_[vibhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibhu "Vibhu")_), 
but some Hindu scholars propose soul to be atomic. 

Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [Brahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman "Brahman") through a monistic or dualistic framework. 
In contrast, Jain thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, 
and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, 
thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in not recognizing the primacy of the Vedas and the Hindu Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe "soul exists" as a self-evident truth. Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India. Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the Hindu caste system, but later scholars consider this a Western error. A caste system not based on birth has been a historic part of Jain society, and Jainism focused on transforming the individual, not society.[[h]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism#cite_note-258)
