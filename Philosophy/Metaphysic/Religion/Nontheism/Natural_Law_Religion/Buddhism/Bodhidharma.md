## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Bodhidharma**  was a semi-legendary Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century CE. 
> He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, 
> and is regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. 
> He is also popularly regarded as the founder of Shaolin kung fu, 
> an idea popularized in the 20th century, 
> but based on the 17th century Yijin Jing 
> and the Daoist association of daoyin gymnastics with Bodhidharma. 
>
> Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, 
> and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details. 
> According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, 
> which typically refers to Central Asia but can also include the Indian subcontinent, 
> and is described as either a "Persian Central Asian" 
> or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king." 
> 
> Aside from the Chinese accounts, several popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins. 
> Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as 
> an ill-tempered, large-nosed, profusely bearded, wide-eyed non-Chinese person. 
> He is referred to as "The Blue-Eyed Barbarian" (Chinese: 碧眼胡; pinyin: Bìyǎnhú) in Chan texts.
>
> The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, 
> with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liu Song dynasty (420–479 CE) 
> and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liang dynasty (502–557 CE). 
> Bodhidharma was primarily active in the territory of the Northern Wei (386–534 CE). 
> Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century CE.
>
> Bodhidharma's teachings and practice centered on meditation and the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra. 
> The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall identifies Bodhidharma as the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism 
> in an uninterrupted line that extends back to the Gautama Buddha himself.
