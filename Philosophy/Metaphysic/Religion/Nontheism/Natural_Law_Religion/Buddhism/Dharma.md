> **Dharma** (; Sanskrit: धर्म, pronounced [dʱɐrmɐ] ) is a key concept in various Indian religions. 
> The term dharma does not have a single, clear translation 
> and conveys a multifaceted idea. 
> 
> Etymologically, it comes from the Sanskrit dhr-, meaning to hold or to support, 
> thus referring to law that sustains things—from one's life to society, 
> and to the Universe at large. 
> 
> In its most commonly used sense, dharma refers to 
> an individual's moral responsibilities or duties; 
> the dharma of a farmer differs from the dharma of a soldier, 
> thus making the concept of dharma dynamic. 
> 
> As with the other components of the Puruṣārtha, the concept of dharma is pan-Indian. 
> The antonym of dharma is adharma.
>
> In Hinduism, dharma denotes behaviour that is considered to be in accord with Ṛta—the "order and custom" that makes life and universe possible. This includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living" according to the stage of life or social position. Dharma is believed to have a transtemporal validity, and is one of the Puruṣārtha. The concept of dharma was in use in the historical Vedic religion (1500–500 BCE), and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia.
>
> In Buddhism, dharma (Pali: dhamma) refers to the teachings of the Buddha and to the true nature of reality (which the teachings point to). In Buddhist philosophy, dhamma/dharma is also the term for specific "phenomena" and for the ultimate truth. Dharma in Jainism refers to the teachings of Tirthankara (Jina) and the body of doctrine pertaining to purification and moral transformation. In Sikhism, dharma indicates the path of righteousness, proper religious practices, and performing moral duties.
