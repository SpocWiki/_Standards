> Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Buddhism practiced in Tibet, Bhutan and Mongolia. 
> 
> It also has a sizable number of adherents in the areas surrounding the Himalayas, 
> including the Indian regions of Ladakh, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, 
> as well as in Nepal. 
> 
> Smaller groups of practitioners can be found in Central Asia, 
> some regions of China such as Northeast China, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia 
> and some regions of Russia, such as Tuva, Buryatia, and Kalmykia.
>
> Tibetan Buddhism evolved as a form of Mahayana Buddhism 
> stemming from the latest stages of Buddhism (which included many Vajrayana elements). 
> 
> It thus preserves many Indian Buddhist tantric practices of the 
> post-Gupta early medieval period (500–1200 CE), 
> along with numerous native Tibetan developments. 
> 
> In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet 
> primarily due to the influence of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, 
> founded by Kublai Khan, who ruled China, Mongolia, and parts of Siberia. 
> 
> In the Modern era, Tibetan Buddhism has spread outside of Asia 
> because of the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora (1959 onwards). 
> 
> As the Dalai Lama escaped to India, the Indian subcontinent is also known for its 
> renaissance of Tibetan Buddhism monasteries, 
> including the rebuilding of the three major monasteries of the Gelug tradition.
>
> Apart from classical Mahāyāna Buddhist practices like the ten perfections, 
> Tibetan Buddhism also includes tantric practices, such as deity yoga 
> and the Six Dharmas of Naropa, as well as 
> methods that are seen as transcending tantra, like Dzogchen. 
> Its main goal is Buddhahood. 
> 
> The primary language of scriptural study in this tradition is classical Tibetan.
>
> Tibetan Buddhism has four major schools, namely 
> - Nyingma (8th century), 
> - Kagyu (11th century), 
> - Sakya (1073), and 
> - Gelug (1409). 
> The Jonang is a smaller school that exists, 
> and the Rimé movement (19th century), meaning "no sides", 
> is a more recent non-sectarian movement 
> that attempts to preserve and understand **all** the different traditions. 
> 
> The predominant spiritual tradition in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism 
> was Bon, which has been strongly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism 
> (particularly the Nyingma school). 
> 
> While each of the four major schools is independent 
> and has its own monastic institutions and leaders, 
> they are closely related and intersect with common contact and dialogue.
