> and is regarded as its first Chinese patriarch. 
> He is also popularly regarded as the founder of Shaolin kung fu,

> and the Daoist association of daoyin gymnastics with Bodhidharma. 
>
> Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, 
> and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details. 
> According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, 
> which typically refers to Central Asia but can also include the Indian subcontinent, 
> and is described as either a "Persian Central Asian" 
> or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king."

> The accounts also differ on the date of his arrival, 
> with one early account claiming that he arrived during the Liu Song dynasty (420–479 CE) 
> and later accounts dating his arrival to the Liang dynasty (502–557 CE). 
> Bodhidharma was primarily active in the territory of the Northern Wei (386–534 CE). 
> Modern scholarship dates him to about the early 5th century CE.
