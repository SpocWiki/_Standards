> The Pāḷi Canon is the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, 
> as preserved in the Pāli language. 
> It is the most complete extant early Buddhist canon. 
> It derives mainly from the Tambapaṇṇiya school.
>
> According to Buddhist tradition, during the First Buddhist Council, 
> three months after the parinibbana of Gautama Buddha in Rajgir, 
> Ananda recited the Sutta Pitaka, and Upali recited the Vinaya Pitaka. 
> 
> The Arhats present accepted the recitations, 
> and henceforth, the teachings were preserved orally by the Sangha. 
> The Tipitaka that was transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of King Asoka 
> was initially preserved orally and later written down on palm leaves 
> during the Fourth Buddhist Council in 29 BC, 
> approximately 454 years after the death of Gautama Buddha. 
> The claim that the texts were "spoken by the Buddha" is meant in this non-literal sense.
>
> The existence of the Bhāṇaka tradition existing until later periods, along with other sources, 
> shows that oral tradition continued to exist side by side with written scriptures for many centuries to come. 
> 
> Thus, the so-called writing down of the scriptures 
> was only the beginning of a new form of tradition, 
> and the innovation was likely opposed by the more conservative monks. 
> 
> As with many other innovations, it was only after some time that it was generally accepted. 
> Therefore, it was much later 
> that the records of this event were transformed into an account of a "council" 
> (sangayana or sangiti) which was held under the patronage of King Vattagamani.
>
> Textual fragments of similar teachings have been found 
> in the agama of other major Buddhist schools in India. 
> 
> They were, however, written down in various Prakrits other than Pali as well as Sanskrit. 
> Some of those were later translated into Chinese (earliest dating to the late 4th century AD). 
> The surviving Sri Lankan version is the most complete, 
> but was extensively redacted about 1,000 years after Buddha's death, 
> in the 5th or 6th-century CE. 
> 
> The earliest textual fragments of canonical Pali were found in the Pyu city-states 
> in Burma dating only to the mid-5th to mid-6th century CE.
>
> The Pāli Canon falls into three general categories, called pitaka (from Pali piṭaka, meaning "basket", referring to the receptacles in which the palm-leaf manuscripts were kept). Thus, the canon is traditionally known as the Tipiṭaka ("three baskets"). The three pitakas are as follows:
>
> 
>
> Vinaya Piṭaka ("Discipline Basket"), dealing with rules or discipline of the sangha
>
> Sutta Piṭaka (Sutra/Sayings Basket), discourses and sermons of Buddha, some religious poetry; the largest basket
>
> Abhidhamma Piṭaka, treatises that elaborate Buddhist doctrines, particularly about mind; also called the "systematic philosophy" basket
>
> The Vinaya Pitaka and the Sutta Pitaka are remarkably similar to the works of the early Buddhist schools, often termed Early Buddhist Texts. The Abhidhamma Pitaka, however, is a strictly Theravada collection and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools.
