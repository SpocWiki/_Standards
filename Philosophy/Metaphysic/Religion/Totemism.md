> A totem (from Ojibwe: ᑑᑌᒼ or ᑑᑌᒻ 'doodem') is a spirit being, sacred object, 
> or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people, such as a 
> family, clan, lineage, or tribe, such as in the Anishinaabe clan system.
>
> While the word totem itself is an anglicisation of the [[../../../Society/Anthropology/Sociology/Human_Social_Group/Nation/Ethnic_Group/Ojibwe]] term 
> (and both the word and beliefs associated with it are part of the Ojibwe culture), 
> belief in tutelary spirits and deities is not limited to the Ojibwe people. 
> 
> Similar concepts, under differing names and with variations in beliefs and practices, 
> may be found in a number of cultures worldwide. 
> The term has also been adopted, and at times redefined, 
> by anthropologists and philosophers of different cultures.
>
> Contemporary neoshamanic, New Age, and mythopoetic movements 
> not otherwise involved in the practice of a traditional, tribal religion 
> have been known to use "totem" terminology 
> for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or spirit guide.
