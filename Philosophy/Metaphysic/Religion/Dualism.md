> that reality is fundamentally composed of two parts
>
> Mind–body dualism, or substance dualism, a philosophical view which holds that mental phenomena are, at least in certain respects, not physical phenomena, or that the mind and the body are distinct and separable from one another
>
> Property dualism, a view in the philosophy of mind and metaphysics which holds that, although the world is composed of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties
>
> Epistemological dualism, the epistemological question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by neural processes in our brain
>
> Dualism may also refer to:
>
> Dualism (cybernetics), systems or problems in which an intelligent adversary attempts to exploit the weaknesses of the investigator
>
> Dualism (politics), the separation of powers between the cabinet and parliament

>
> Ethical dualism, the attribution of good solely to one group of people and evil to another
