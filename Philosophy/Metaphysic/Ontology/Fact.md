> A **Fact** is a true datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance. 
> Standard reference works are often used to check facts. 
> Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation 
> or measurement by experiments or other means. 
> 
> Generally speaking, facts are independent of 
> - belief, 
> - knowledge and 
> - opinion. 
>
> Facts are different from 
> - inferences, 
> - theories, 
> - values, and 
> - objects.
>
> For example, "This sentence contains words." accurately describes a linguistic fact, 
> and "the Sun is a star" describes an astronomical fact. 
> Further, "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States" 
> and "Abraham Lincoln was assassinated" are both historical facts.
