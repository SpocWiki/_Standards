> **Ontology** is the philosophical study of being. 
> It is traditionally understood as the subdiscipline of metaphysics 
> focused on the most general features of reality. 
> As one of the most fundamental concepts, **being** encompasses all of reality and every entity within it. 
> 
> To articulate the basic structure of being, ontology examines the commonalities among all things 
> and investigates their classification into basic types, such as the categories of particulars and universals. 
> 
> Particulars are unique, non-repeatable entities, such as the person Socrates, 
> whereas universals are general, repeatable, usually abstract entities, like the color green. 
> 
> Another distinction exists between concrete objects existing in space and time, such as a tree, 
> and abstract objects existing outside space and time, like the number 7. 
> Systems of categories aim to provide a comprehensive inventory of reality 
> by employing categories such as substance, property, relation, state of affairs, and event.
>
> Ontologists disagree regarding which entities exist at the most basic level. 
> Platonic realism asserts that universals have objective existence, 
> while conceptualism maintains that universals exist only in the mind, 
> and nominalism denies their existence altogether. 
> 
> Similar disputes pertain to mathematical objects, 
> unobservable objects assumed by scientific theories, and moral facts. 
> 
> Materialism posits that fundamentally only matter exists, 
> whereas dualism asserts that mind and matter are independent principles. 
> According to some ontologists, objective answers to ontological questions do not exist, 
> with perspectives shaped by differing linguistic practices.
>
> Ontology employs diverse methods of inquiry, including the analysis of concepts and experience, 
> the use of intuitions and thought experiments, and the integration of findings from natural science. 
> 
> Formal ontology investigates the most abstract features of objects, 
> while applied ontology utilizes ontological theories and principles to study entities within specific domains. For example, social ontology examines basic concepts used in the social sciences. Applied ontology is particularly relevant to information and computer science, which develop conceptual frameworks of limited domains. These frameworks facilitate the structured storage of information, such as in a college database tracking academic activities. Ontology is also pertinent to the fields of logic, theology, and anthropology.
>
> The origins of ontology lie in the ancient period with speculations about the nature of being and the source of the universe, including ancient Indian, Chinese, and Greek philosophy. In the modern period, philosophers conceived ontology as a distinct academic discipline and coined its name.
