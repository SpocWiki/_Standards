## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Idealism** in philosophy, also known as philosophical idealism or metaphysical idealism, 
> is the set of metaphysical perspectives asserting that, most fundamentally, 
> reality is equivalent to mind, spirit, or consciousness; 
> that reality or truth is entirely a mental construct; 
> or that ideas are the highest type of reality or have the greatest claim to being considered "real". 
> 
> Because there are different types of idealism, it is difficult to define the term uniformly.
>
> Indian philosophy contains some of the first defenses of idealism, 
> such as in Vedanta and in Shaiva Pratyabhijña thought. 
> 
> These systems of thought argue for an all-pervading consciousness 
> as the true nature and ground of reality. 
> 
> Idealism is also found in some streams of Mahayana Buddhism, such as in the Yogācāra school, 
> which argued for a "mind-only" (cittamatra) philosophy on an analysis of subjective experience. 
> 
> In the West, idealism traces its roots back to Plato in ancient Greece, 
> who proposed that absolute, unchanging, timeless ideas constitute the highest form of reality: 
> Platonic idealism. 
> 
> This was revived and transformed in the early modern period by Immanuel Kant's arguments 
> that our knowledge of reality is completely based on mental structures: transcendental idealism.
>
> Epistemologically, idealism is accompanied by a 
> rejection of the possibility of knowing the existence of any thing independent of mind. 
> 
> Ontologically, idealism asserts that the existence of all things depends upon the mind; 
> thus, ontological idealism rejects the perspectives of physicalism and dualism. 
> 
> In contrast to materialism, 
> idealism asserts the primacy of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of all phenomena.
>
> Idealism came under attack from proponents of analytical philosphy, 
> such as G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, but its critics also included the new realists and Marxists. 
> 
> However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy.
