## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **supernatural** phenomena or entities are those beyond the laws of nature. 
> The term is derived from Medieval Latin supernaturalis, 
> from Latin super- 'above, beyond, outside of' + natura 'nature'. 
> Although the corollary term "nature" has had multiple meanings since the ancient world, 
> the term "supernatural" emerged in the Middle Ages and did not exist in the ancient world.
>
> The supernatural is featured in folklore and religious contexts, 
> but can also feature as an explanation in more secular contexts, 
> as in the cases of superstitions or belief in the paranormal. The term is attributed to non-physical entities, such as angels, demons, gods and spirits. It also includes claimed abilities embodied in or provided by such beings, including magic, telekinesis, levitation, precognition and extrasensory perception.
>
> The supernatural is hypernymic to religion. Religions are standardized supernaturalist worldviews, or at least more complete than single supernaturalist views. Supernaturalism is the adherence to the supernatural (beliefs, and not violations of causality and the physical laws).
