## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Parapsychology** is the study of alleged psychic phenomena 
> (extrasensory perception, telepathy, teleportation, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis (also called telekinesis), and psychometry) and other paranormal claims, 
> for example, those related to near-death experiences, synchronicity, apparitional experiences, etc. 
> 
> Criticized as being a pseudoscience, the majority of mainstream scientists reject it. 
> Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation 
> despite being unable to provide reproducible evidence for the existence of 
> any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research.
>
> Parapsychology research rarely appears in mainstream scientific journals; 
> a few niche journals publish most papers about parapsychology.
