> Moses ben Maimon (1138–1204), commonly known as **Maimonides** (, my-MON-ih-deez), 
> also referred to by the Hebrew acronym Rambam (Hebrew: רמב״ם), was a Sephardic rabbi and philosopher 
> who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages. 
> 
> In his time, he was also a preeminent astronomer and physician, serving as the personal physician of Saladin. 
> He was born and lived in Córdoba in al-Andalus (now in Spain) 
> within the Almoravid Empire on Passover eve 1138 or 1135, 
> until his family was expelled for refusing to convert to Islam. 
> Later, he lived in Morocco and Egypt and worked as a rabbi, physician and philosopher.
>
> During his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides' writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, 
> even as far away as Iraq and Yemen. 
> Yet, while Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the Jewish community in Egypt, 
> his writings also had vociferous critics, particularly in Spain. 
> 
> He died in Fustat, Egypt, and, according to Jewish tradition, was buried in Tiberias. 
> His tomb in Tiberias is a popular pilgrimage and tourist site.
>
> He was posthumously acknowledged as one of the foremost rabbinic decisors and philosophers in Jewish history, 
> and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship. 
> His fourteen-volume Mishneh Torah still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of halakha.
>
> Aside from being revered by Jewish historians, 
> Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences. 
> Influenced by [[../Ancient_Philosopher/Aristotle|Aristotle]], Al-Farabi, [[../../../Science/Scientist/Middle_Age_Scientists/Avicenna]], and his contemporary Ibn Rushd, 
> he became a prominent philosopher and polymath in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds.
