> Pericles (, Ancient Greek: Περικλῆς; c. 495 – 429 BC) 
> was a Greek politician and general during the Golden Age of Athens. 
> 
> He was prominent and influential in Ancient Athenian politics, 
> particularly between the Greco-Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, 
> and was acclaimed by Thucydides, a contemporary historian, 
> as "the first citizen of Athens". 
> 
> Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire 
> and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. 
> The period during which he led Athens as Archon (ruler), roughly from 461 to 429 BC, 
> is sometimes known as the "Age of Pericles", 
> but the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars 
> or as late as the following century.
>
> Pericles promoted the arts and literature, and it was principally through his efforts 
> that Athens acquired the reputation 
> of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. 
> 
> He started an ambitious project 
> that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis, 
> including the Parthenon. 
> 
> This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, 
> and gave work to its people. 
> 
> Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent 
> that critics called him a populist. 
> Pericles was descended, through his mother, 
> from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family. 
> 
> He, along with several members of his family, 
> succumbed to the Plague of Athens in 429 BC, 
> which weakened the city-state during a protracted conflict with Sparta.
