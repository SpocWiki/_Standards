> **Democritus** (, dim-OCK-rit-əs; Greek: Δημόκριτος, Dēmókritos, 
> meaning "chosen of the people"; c. 460 – c. 370 BC) 
> was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from Abdera, 
> primarily remembered today for his formulation of an atomic theory of the universe. 
> Democritus wrote extensively on a wide variety of topics.
>
> None of Democritus' original work has survived, except through second-hand references. 
> Many of these references come from Aristotle, 
> who viewed him as an important rival in the field of natural philosophy. 
> He was known in antiquity as the ‘laughing philosopher’ 
> because of his emphasis on the value of cheerfulness.
