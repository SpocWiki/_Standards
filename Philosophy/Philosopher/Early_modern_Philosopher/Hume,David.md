> **David Hume** (born David Home; 7 May 1711 – 25 August 1776) 
> was a Scottish [[../../Philosopher|philosopher]], historian, economist, and essayist who was best known for 
> his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical skepticism and metaphysical naturalism. 
> 
> Beginning with A Treatise of Human Nature (1739–40), 
> Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man 
> that examined the psychological basis of human nature. 
> 
> Hume followed [[Locke,John]] in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, 
> concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. 
> This places him with [[Bacon,Francis|Francis Bacon]], [[../../../../_protect/Society/Sociology/Politics/UK_Politics/Hobbes,Thomas|Thomas Hobbes]], [[Locke,John|John Locke]], and George Berkeley as an empiricist.
>
> Hume argued that [[inductive reasoning]] and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; 
> instead, they result from custom and mental habit. 
> 
> We never actually perceive that one event causes another, 
> but only experience the "constant conjunction" of events. 
> 
> This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, 
> it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past; 
> this metaphysical presupposition cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.
>
> An opponent of philosophical rationalists, 
> Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, 
> famously proclaiming that "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions." 
> This makes him a predecessor of [[../../../../_protect/bio/Psychology/Psychologist/Kahnemann,Daniel]]. 
> 
> Hume was also a [[sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment 
> rather than abstract moral principle. 
> 
> He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena 
> and is usually accepted by historians of European philosophy 
> to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, 
> or the idea that a statement of fact alone 
> can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done.
>
> Hume denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, 
> positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations, 
> and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of perceptions connected by an association of ideas. 
> 
> Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. 
> His philosophy of religion, including his rejection of miracles, 
> and of the argument from design for God's existence, were especially controversial for their time. 
> 
> Hume left a legacy that affected utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, 
> early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and many other fields and thinkers. 
> [[Kant,Immanuel]] credited Hume as the inspiration that had awakened him from his "dogmatic slumbers."
