> **Francis Bacon**, 1st Viscount St Alban, 1st Lord Verulam, PC (22 January 1561 – 9 April 1626) 
> was an English philosopher and statesman 
> who served as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England under King James I. 
> Bacon argued the importance of natural philosophy, guided by [[scientific method]], 
> and his works remained influential throughout the Scientific Revolution.
>
> Bacon has been called the father of [[empiricism]]. 
> He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge 
> based only upon [[inductive reasoning]] and careful observation of events in nature. 
> 
> He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach 
> whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. 
> 
> Although his most specific proposals about such a method, 
> the Baconian method, did not have long-lasting influence, 
> the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology 
> makes Bacon one of the later founders of the scientific method. 
> 
> His portion of the method based in scepticism was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, 
> whose practical details are still central to debates on science and methodology. 
> He is famous for his role in the scientific revolution, 
> promoting scientific experimentation as a way of glorifying God and fulfilling scripture.
>
> Bacon was a patron of libraries and developed a system for cataloguing books under three categories – 
> history, poetry, and philosophy –  which could further be divided into specific subjects and subheadings. 
> About books he wrote: "Some books are to be tasted; others swallowed; 
> and some few to be chewed and digested." 
> 
> The Shakespearean authorship thesis, 
> a fringe theory which was first proposed in the mid-19th century, 
> contends that Bacon wrote at least some 
> and possibly all of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.
>
> Bacon was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, 
> where he rigorously followed the medieval curriculum, which was presented largely in Latin. 
> He was the first recipient of the Queen's counsel designation, 
> conferred in 1597 when Elizabeth I reserved him as her legal advisor. 
> 
> After the accession of James I in 1603, Bacon was knighted, 
> then created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St Alban in 1621. 
> 
> He had no heirs, and so both titles became extinct on his death of pneumonia in 1626 at the age of 65. 
> 
> He is buried at St Michael's Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.
