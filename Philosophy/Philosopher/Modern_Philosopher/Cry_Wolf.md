> The Boy Who Cried Wolf is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 210 in the Perry Index. 
> From it is derived the English idiom "to cry wolf", 
> defined as "to give a false alarm" in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable 
> and glossed by the Oxford English Dictionary as meaning to make false claims, 
> with the result that subsequent true claims are disbelieved.
