> Thomas Paine (born Thomas Pain, February 9, 1737 [O.S. January 29, 1736]  – June 8, 1809) 
> was an English-born American Founding Father, French Revolutionary, 
> inventor, political philosopher, and statesman. 
> 
> His pamphlets Common Sense (1776) and The American Crisis (1776–1783) 
> framed the Patriot argument for independence from Great Britain 
> at the outset of the American Revolution. 
> 
> Paine advanced Enlightenment-era arguments for human rights 
> that shaped revolutionary discourse on both sides of the Atlantic.
>
> Born in Thetford, Norfolk, Paine immigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 
> with the help of Benjamin Franklin, arriving in time to participate in the American Revolution. 
> 
> Virtually every American Patriot read his 47-page pamphlet Common Sense, 
> which catalyzed the call for independence from Great Britain. 
> 
> He followed that breakthrough with the pro-independence American Crisis pamphlet series. 
> 
> Paine returned to Britain in 1787 and wrote Rights of Man (1791) 
> to rebut critics of the French Revolution, 
> particularly the Anglo-Irish conservative writer Edmund Burke. 
> His authorship of the tract led to a trial and conviction in absentia in England in 1792 
> for the crime of seditious libel.
>
> The British government of William Pitt the Younger 
> was worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to Britain 
> and had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. 
> 
> Paine's work advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government 
> and was therefore targeted with a writ for his arrest issued in early 1792. 
> 
> Paine fled to France in September, despite not being able to speak French, 
> but he was quickly elected to the French National Convention. 
> 
> The Girondins regarded him as an ally; 
> consequently, the Montagnards regarded him as an enemy, 
> especially Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier, 
> the powerful president of the Committee of General Security. 
> 
> In December 1793, Vadier arrested Paine and took him to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. 
> He completed the first part of The Age of Reason just before he was arrested. 
> 
> Mark Philp notes that "In prison Paine managed to produce 
> (and to convey to Daniel Isaac Eaton, the radical London publisher) 
> a dedication for The Age of Reason and a new edition of the Rights of Man with a new preface." 
> 
> James Monroe used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794.
>
> Paine became notorious because of his pamphlets and attacks on his former allies, 
> who he felt had betrayed him. 
> 
> In The Age of Reason and other writings, he advocated Deism, 
> promoted reason and freethought, and argued against religion in general 
> and Christian doctrine in particular. 
> 
> In 1796, he published a bitter open letter to George Washington, 
> whom he denounced as an incompetent general and a hypocrite. 
> 
> He published the pamphlet Agrarian Justice (1797), discussing the origins of property 
> and introducing the concept of a guaranteed minimum income 
> through a one-time inheritance tax on landowners. 
> 
> In 1802, he returned to the U.S. 
> He died on June 8, 1809. 
> 
> Only six people attended his funeral, 
> as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity and his attacks on the nation's leaders.
