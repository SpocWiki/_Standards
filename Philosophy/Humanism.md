> **Humanism** is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the individual and social potential, 
> and agency of human beings, whom it considers the starting point 
> for serious moral and philosophical inquiry.
>
> The meaning of the term "humanism" has changed according to successive intellectual movements that have identified with it. 
> 
> During the Italian Renaissance, Italian scholars inspired by Greek classical scholarship 
> gave rise to the Renaissance humanism movement. 
> 
> During the Age of Enlightenment, 
> humanistic values were reinforced by advances in science and technology, 
> giving confidence to humans in their exploration of the world. 
> 
> By the early 20th century, 
> organizations dedicated to humanism flourished in Europe and the United States, 
> and have since expanded worldwide. 
> 
> In the early 21st century, the term generally denotes a focus on human well-being 
> and advocates for human freedom, happiness, autonomy, and progress. 
> 
> It views humanity as responsible for the promotion and development of individuals, 
> espouses the equal and inherent dignity of all human beings, 
> and emphasizes a concern for humans in relation to the world. 
> Humanists tend to advocate for human rights, free speech, progressive policies, and democracy.
>
> Starting in the 20th century, organized humanist movements 
> are almost exclusively non-religious and aligned with secularism. 
> 
> In contemporary usage, humanism as a philosophy refers to a non-theistic view 
> centered on human agency, and a reliance only on science and reason 
> rather than revelation from a divine source to understand the world. 
> 
> A humanist worldview by definition asserts that religion is not a precondition of morality, 
> and as such humanists object to excessive religious entanglement with education and the state.
>
> Many contemporary secular humanist organizations work under the umbrella of Humanists International. 
> Well-known humanist associations include Humanists UK and the American Humanist Association.
