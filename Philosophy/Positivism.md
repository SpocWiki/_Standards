> **Positivism** is a philosophical school that holds that all genuine knowledge is either true by definition 
> or positive â€“ meaning a posteriori facts derived by reason and logic from sensory experience. 
> 
> Other ways of knowing, such as intuition, introspection, or religious faith, 
> are rejected or considered meaningless.
>
> Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of Western thought, 
> modern positivism was first articulated in the early 19th century by Auguste Comte. 
> 
> His school of sociological positivism holds that society, like the physical world, 
> operates according to scientific laws. 
> 
> After Comte, positivist schools arose in logic, psychology, economics, historiography, and other fields of thought. 
> 
> Generally, positivists attempted to introduce scientific methods to their respective fields. 
> Since the turn of the 20th century, positivism, although still popular, 
> has declined under criticism within the social sciences by antipositivists and critical theorists, 
> among others, for its alleged scientism, reductionism, overgeneralizations, and methodological limitations. 
> 
> Positivism also exerted an unusual influence on Kardecism.
