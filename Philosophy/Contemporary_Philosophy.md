## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Contemporary philosophy is the present period in the history of Western philosophy 
> beginning in the early 20th century with the increasing professionalization of the discipline and the rise of analytic and continental philosophy. The phrase is often confused with modern philosophy (which refers to an earlier period in Western philosophy), postmodern philosophy (which refers to some philosophers' criticisms of modern philosophy), and with a non-technical use of the phrase referring to any recent philosophic work.
