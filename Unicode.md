> **Unicode**, formally The Unicode Standard, is a text encoding standard maintained by the Unicode Consortium 
> designed to support the use of text written in all of the world's major writing systems. 
> Version 15.1 of the standard defines 149813 characters and 161 scripts 
> used in various ordinary, literary, academic, and technical contexts.
>
> Many common characters, including numerals, punctuation, and other symbols, 
> are unified within the standard and are not treated as specific to any given writing system. 
> 
> Unicode encodes thousands of emoji, with the continued development thereof 
> conducted by the Consortium as a part of the standard. 
> Moreover, the widespread adoption of Unicode was 
> in large part responsible for the initial popularization of emoji outside of Japan. 
> Unicode is ultimately capable of encoding more than 1.1 million characters (ca. 2^20 but more complex).
>
> Unicode has largely supplanted the previous environment of myriad incompatible character sets, 
> each used within different locales and on different computer architectures. 
> Unicode is used to encode the vast majority of text on the Internet, including most web pages, 
> and Unicode support has become a common consideration in contemporary software development.
>
> The Unicode character repertoire is synchronized with ISO/IEC 10646, 
> each being code-for-code identical with one another. 
> 
> However, The Unicode Standard is more than just a repertoire within which characters are assigned. 
> To aid developers and designers, the standard also provides charts and reference data, 
> as well as annexes explaining concepts like scripts, providing guidance for their implementation. 
> 
> Topics covered by these annexes include character normalization, 
> character composition and decomposition, collation, and directionality. 
> 
> Unicode text is processed and stored as binary data using one of several encodings, which define 
> how to translate the standard's abstracted codes for characters into sequences of bytes. 
> 
> The Unicode Standard itself defines three encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, though several others exist. 
> Of these, UTF-8 is the most widely used by a large margin, 
> due to its backwards-compatibility with ASCII and its space-conservation for [[Language/Lang~Family/LangFamily-Indo-European/LangFamily-Germanic/Lang-en|English]] Text and [[Base64]] .
> Before that [[Latin1]] was the most common [[Technology/IT/Data/Code/Encoding]]

## Finding a Unicode Character 

https://shapecatcher.com/ is very useful: Draw the Character and find similar ones. 

Alternatively, each Unicode Character has a textual Description that can be searched.
