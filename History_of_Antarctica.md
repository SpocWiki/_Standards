> The history of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, 
> known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe. 
> The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, 
> was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD.
>
> The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries 
> proved that Terra Australis Incognita ("Unknown Southern Land"), if it existed, 
> was a continent in its own right. 
> 
> In 1773, James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time. 
> Although he discovered new islands, he did not sight the continent itself. 
> It is believed that he came as close as 240 km (150 mi) from the mainland.

> On 28 January 1820, a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev reached 69° 21′ south latitude, 2° 15′ west longitude, and on 2 February, 66° 25′ south latitude, 1° 11′ west longitude, at both of which positions he was stopped by the pack. He then steered eastward, and on 17 February reached 69° 6′ south latitude, and on the 19th, 68° 5′ south latitude, 16° 37′ east longitude. Later, he reached 66° 53′ south latitude, 40° 56′ east longitude, where he thought land must be near, on account of the numbers of birds. Ten months later an American sealer, Nathaniel Palmer, became the first to sight Antarctica on 17 November 1820. The first landing was most likely just over a year later when English-born American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.

> Several expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century, during the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration". Many resulted in injury and death. Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally reached the Pole on 14 December 1911, following a dramatic race with the Briton Robert Falcon Scott.
