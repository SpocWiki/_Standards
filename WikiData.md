This Folder contains Copies of Core-[[../Data/Wikipedia/WikiData|WikiData]] Entities in a flat structure. 
To this purpose configure the [obsidian-wikidata-importer](https://github.com/samwho/obsidian-wikidata-importer) to use 
- the Wikidata Entity Key `has_id_wikidata` and 
- the Internal Link Prefix `_Standards/WD/WD~${label},${id}` 
so they point to this directory.

The first 10_000 Entities are based on the Level 4 (10^4) curated [List of Articles Every Wikipedia Should Have](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have/Expanded). 
These provide a basic, essential content framework for all language editions of Wikipedia, particularly smaller and newer ones. 

This is different from the  [List of vital Wikipedia Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vital_articles), 
which are aimed at improving the quality and coverage 
of primarily the English Wikipedia, to guide editors on which articles to prioritize. 

These Articles are also ranked from Level 1 (with 10 Articles) to Level 5 which currently contains 5e4 Articles. 

These Articles can be updated from Wikidata at any time, so don't edit them directly.
