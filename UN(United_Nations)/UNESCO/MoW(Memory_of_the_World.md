> [[../UNESCO|UNESCO]]'s **Memory of the World** (MoW) Programme is an international initiative 
> launched to safeguard the documentary heritage of humanity 
> against collective amnesia, neglect, decay over time and climatic conditions, as well as deliberate destruction. 
> 
> It calls for the preservation of valuable archival holdings, library collections, 
> and private individual compendia all over the world for posterity, 
> the reconstitution of dispersed or displaced documentary heritage, 
> and increased accessibility to, and dissemination of, these items.
>
> Following the establishment of the international register, 
> UNESCO and the Memory of the World Programme 
> have encouraged the creation of national and regional organizations 
> as well as national and regional registers 
> which focus on documentary heritage of great regional or national importance, 
> but not necessarily of global importance.
