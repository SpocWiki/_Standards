## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The World Heritage Committee is a committee of the 
> United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
> that selects the sites to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 
> including the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, 
> defines the use of the World Heritage Fund and allocates financial assistance upon requests from States Parties. 
> 
> It comprises representatives from 21 state parties 
> that are elected by the General Assembly of States Parties for a four-year term. 
> These parties vote on decisions and proposals related to the World Heritage Convention and World Heritage List. 
>
> According to the World Heritage Convention, a committee member's term of office is six years. 
> However many States Parties choose to voluntarily limit their term to four years, 
> in order to give other States Parties an opportunity to serve.  
> All members elected at the 15th General Assembly (2005) 
> voluntarily chose to reduce their term of office from six to four years.
>
> Deliberations of the World Heritage Committee are aided by three advisory bodies, 
> the IUCN, ICOMOS and ICCROM.
