## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The United Nations Secretariat is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations (UN), 
> The secretariat is the UN's executive arm. 
> 
> The secretariat has an important role in setting the agenda 
> for the deliberative and decision-making bodies of the UN 
> (i.e., the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, and Security Council), 
> and the implementation of the decision of these bodies. 
> The secretary-general, who is appointed by the General Assembly, 
> is the head of the secretariat.
>
> The mandate of the secretariat is a wide one. 
> Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN's second secretary-general, described its power as follows: 
> "The United Nations is what member nations made it, 
> but within the limits set by government action and government cooperation, 
> much depends on what the secretariat makes it. It has creative capacity. 
> It can introduce new ideas. It can, in proper forms, take initiatives. 
> It can put before member governments findings which will influence their actions". 
> 
> The United Nations Department of Political Affairs, 
> which has a role analogous to a ministry of foreign affairs, is a part of the secretariat. 
> 
> So is the Department of Peace Operations. 
> 
> The secretariat is the main source of economic and political analysis for the General Assembly and Security Council; it administers operations initiated by UN's deliberative organs, operates political missions, prepares assessments that precede peacekeeping operations, appoints the heads of peacekeeping operations, conducts surveys and research, communicates with non-state actors such as media and non-government organizations, and is responsible for publishing all of the treaties and international agreements.
