> **Ban Ki-moon** (born 13 June 1944) is a South Korean politician and diplomat 
> who served as the eighth secretary-general of the United Nations between 2007 and 2016. 
> 
> Prior to his appointment as secretary-general, 
> Ban was the South Korean minister of foreign affairs and trade between 2004 and 2006. 
> Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office 
> of Secretary-General of the United Nations; he began to campaign for the office in February 2006. 
> As the foreign minister of South Korea, 
> he was able to travel to all the countries on the United Nations Security Council, 
> a manoeuvre that subsequently turned him into the campaign's front-runner.
>
> On 13 October 2006, 
> Ban was elected as the eighth secretary-general by the United Nations General Assembly. 
> On 1 January 2007, he succeeded Kofi Annan. 
> 
> As secretary-general, he was responsible for 
> several major reforms on peacekeeping and UN employment practices around the world. 
> 
> Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on global warming, 
> pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President George W. Bush, 
> and on the Darfur conflict, where he helped persuade Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir 
> to allow peacekeeping troops to enter Sudan. 
> 
> Ban was named the world's 32nd most powerful person by the 
> Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People in 2013, the highest among South Koreans. 
> 
> In 2014, he was named the third most powerful South Korean after Lee Kun-hee and Lee Jae-yong. 
> In 2016, Foreign Policy named Ban one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers 
> for his achievement of helping the Paris Agreement to be ratified and enforced 
> less than a year after it was adopted.
>
> António Guterres was appointed by the General Assembly on 13 October 2016 
> to be the successor of Ban Ki-moon as he exited on 31 December 2016. 
> He was widely considered to be a potential candidate for the 2017 South Korean presidential election, 
> before announcing, on 1 February, that he would not be running. 
> 
> On 14 September 2017, Ban was 
> elected chair of the International Olympic Committee's Ethics Commission. 
> Also in 2017, Ban co-founded the nonprofit Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens. 
> He also currently serves as the Distinguished Chair Professor 
> at Yonsei University's Institute for Global Engagement and Empowerment.
>
> 
>
> On 20 February 2018, Ban was unanimously elected as the 
> president of the Assembly and chair of the council by all members of the Assembly and council, 
> respectively, the two governance organs of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), 
> a treaty-based international, inter-governmental organization 
> dedicated to supporting and promoting environmentally sustainable 
> and socially inclusive economic growth in developing countries and emerging economies. 
> 
> Since Ban's election as the president and chair, GGGI's list of member states has expanded 
> from 27 to 48 member countries and regional integration organizations. 
> 
> On 16 October 2018, the Global Commission on Adaptation was launched 
> with Ban as co-chair, together with Bill Gates and Kristalina Georgieva. 
> 
> The commission's mandate to accelerate adaptation 
> by elevating the political visibility of adaptation and focusing on concrete solutions came to an end 
> following its Year of Action in 2020, with its work showcased at the Climate Adaptation Summit 
> hosted by the Netherlands on 25 January 2021. 
> 
> Ban currently serves as co-chair for the Global Center on Adaptation, which is taking forward the commission's work through its programs. He became the first major international diplomat to throw his weight behind the Green New Deal, a nascent effort by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party in the United States to zero out planet-warming emissions and end poverty over the next decade.
