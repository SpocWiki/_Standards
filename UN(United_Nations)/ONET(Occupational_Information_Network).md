# [[ONET(Occupational_Information_Network)]] 

O_NET (Occupational Information Network) is a comprehensive database of occupational information 
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor. 

Within O_NET, **defined terms** refer to 
standardized concepts, attributes, or descriptors used to describe occupations systematically. 
These terms allow for consistent data analysis, cross-occupation comparison, and integration into software applications.

#### Occupation-Specific Terms

**Occupation Titles**  
These are standardized names for job roles used in the database, 
based on the **Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system**. For example, 
- Software Developer, Applications or Registered Nurse

**Alternate Titles**  
Synonyms or commonly used variations of occupation titles, providing additional context for searches or matching.

**Description**  
A textual narrative describing typical tasks, responsibilities, and purpose of the occupation.

### Groups 


### Table of Major Defined Terms in O*NET


- **Importance vs Level:** Importance reflects how critical the term is to the occupation, while Level indicates the degree of mastery expected.
    
- **Quantitative Data:** Most terms like Skills, Abilities, and DWAs are measured **0–100**%, allowing direct comparison across occupations.
    
- **Categorical Terms:** Job Zone, Education, and Experience are categorical or absolute, not scaled numerically.
    
- **Applications:** These defined terms enable automated job matching, labor market analysis, and AI-driven career guidance.


#### Technology and Tools

The ONET database also includes metadata for these terms, 
such as **importance (Emp%) and level% ratings**, enabling quantitative comparison across occupations. 

For instance, _Critical Thinking_ in _Software Developer_ may have **Importance = 85** and **Level = 80**, 
whereas in _Retail Salesperson_, it may have **Importance = 40** and **Level = 30**.
