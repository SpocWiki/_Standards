> and a leading supporter of exchange-rate stability. 
> Its stated mission is "working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, 
> facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, 
> and reduce poverty around the world."
>
> Established in July 1944 at the [[Bretton_Woods_Conference]], 
> primarily according to the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, 
> it started with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system after World War II. 
> 
> In its early years, the IMF primarily focused on facilitating fixed exchange rates across the developed world. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. Through a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which countries can borrow if they experience balance of payments problems. The IMF works to stabilize and foster the economies of its member countries by its use of the fund, as well as other activities such as gathering and analyzing economic statistics and surveillance of its members' economies.
>
> The current managing director (MD) and chairperson of the IMF is Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, who has held the post since 1 October 2019. Indian-American economist Gita Gopinath, previously the chief economist, was appointed as first deputy managing director, effective 21 January 2022. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas was appointed chief economist on 24 January 2022.

> Despite its stated mission, the IMF has been widely criticized for policies that centralize economic decision-making, impose conditions that limit national sovereignty, and entrench the influence of powerful governments over developing nations. Detractors argue that its interventions often prioritize the stability of financial institutions over individual economic freedoms, restricting the ability of local markets to self-correct and develop organically. Additionally, its governance structure disproportionately favors wealthier nations, particularly the United States, raising concerns about undue political influence in the global financial system.
