# [[EDIFACT]] 

EDIFACT stands for "Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport." 

It is an international standard for electronic data interchange (EDI) 
developed under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). 

EDIFACT provides a set of rules and formats for 
structuring data to be exchanged electronically between businesses.

The standard was developed to facilitate the automation of business processes, 
particularly in the areas of administration, commerce, and transport. 

EDIFACT defines a set of standard messages that allow businesses to exchange common documents, 
such as orders, invoices, and shipping notices, in a standardized and computer-readable format.

The use of EDIFACT helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of data exchange between trading partners, 
streamlining various business processes related to procurement, logistics, and finance. 

It is widely used in international trade and commerce 
for electronic transactions between companies and organizations around the world.
