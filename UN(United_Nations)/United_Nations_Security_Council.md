> The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) 
> is one of the six principal organs of the UN system 
> and is the primary organ charged with ensuring international peace and security. 
> 
> Its powers as outlined in the UN Charter include authorizing military action, 
> establishing peacekeeping operations, 
> recommending the admission of new members to the UN General Assembly, 
> approving any changes to the Charter, and enacting international sanctions. 
> 
> Chapter VII of the UN Charter gives the Security Council 
> the power to identify threats to international peace and security 
> and to authorize responses, including the use of force. 
> 
> Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII are binding on UN members 
> and are therefore a source of international law. 
> The Security Council is the only UN body with the authority to issue resolutions 
> that are binding on its member states.
>
> Like the United Nations as a whole, the Security Council was created after World War II 
> in 1945 in the hope of preventing future wars and maintaining world peace, 
> as the League of Nations had been formed following World War I. 
> 
> It held its first session on 17 January 1946 
> but was largely paralyzed in the following decades 
> by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (and their allies). 
> 
> Nevertheless, it authorized military interventions in the Korean War, the Congo Crisis, 
> and peacekeeping missions in Cyprus, West New Guinea, and the Sinai Peninsula. 
> 
> With the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
> UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale, 
> with the Security Council authorizing major military and peacekeeping missions in 
> Kuwait, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
>
> The Security Council consists of 15 members, of which five are permanent: 
> - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
> 
> These were the great powers that were the victors of World War II 
> (or their recognized successor states). 
> Permanent members can veto any substantive Security Council resolution, 
> including those on the admission of new member states to the UN 
> or nominees for the Office of the Secretary-General. 
> 
> This veto right does not carry over into General Assembly matters or votes, 
> which are non-binding. 
> 
> The other 10 members are elected on a regional basis for a term of two years. 
> 
> The body's presidency rotates monthly amongst its members.
>
> Resolutions of the Security Council are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers, which consist of military forces voluntarily provided by member states and funded independently of the main UN budget. As of November 2021, there have been 12 peacekeeping missions with over 87,000 personnel from 121 countries, with a total annual budget of approximately $6.3 billion.
