> The International Maritime Organization (IMO; 
> French: Organisation maritime internationale; Spanish: Organización Marítima Internacional) 
> is a specialized agency of the United Nations regulating maritime transport. 
> 
> It was established following agreement at a UN conference held in Geneva in 1948, 
> but this did not come into force for ten years, and the new body, 
> then called the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, 
> first assembled on 6 January 1959.  
> Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the IMO has 176 Member States 
> and three Associate Members as of 2025.
>
> The IMO's purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping and its remit includes maritime safety, environmental concerns, and legal matters. IMO is governed by an assembly of members which meets every two years. Its finance and organization is administered by a council of 40 members elected from the assembly. The work of IMO is conducted through five committees supported by technical subcommittees. Other UN organizations may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status is granted to qualified NGOs.
>
> IMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are representative of the organization's members. The secretariat is composed of a Secretary-General elected by the assembly, and various divisions such as those for marine safety, environmental protection and a conference section.
