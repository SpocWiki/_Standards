Classification 
System


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The North American Industry Classification System or **NAICS** 
> is a classification of business establishments by type of economic activity. 
> 
> It is used by governments and business in Canada, Mexico, 
> and the United States of America.  
> 
> It has largely replaced the older Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, 
> except in some government agencies, such as the 
> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
>
> An establishment is typically a single physical location, though administratively distinct operations at a single location may be treated as separate establishments.  Each establishment is classified as an industry according to the primary business activity taking place there.  NAICS does not offer guidance on organizing enterprises (companies) composed of multiple establishments.

The NAICS numbering system employs a 5-digit  code (6 at the most detailed industry level). 
The first five digits are generally (although not always strictly) the same in all three countries. 
- The first two digits designate the largest business sector; 
- the third digit represents the subsector; the fourth digit represents the industry group; 
- the fifth digit designates the NAICS [industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_\(economics\)), 
- and the sixth digit represents the national [industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_\(economics\)).
The system is designed to be largely compatible with the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") Statistical Office's [International Standard Industrial Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Industrial_Classification "International Standard Industrial Classification") system (ISIC).
