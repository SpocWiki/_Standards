> The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) 
> (French: Organisation Hydrographique Internationale) 
> is an intergovernmental organization representing hydrography. 
> As of August 2025, the IHO comprised 103 member states.
>
> A principal aim of the IHO is to ensure 
> that the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted. 
> It does this through the setting of international standards 
> and through its capacity building programs and offices.
>
> The IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations, 
> where it is the recognized competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. 
> 
> When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in conventions and similar instruments, 
> it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used.
