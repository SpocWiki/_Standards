## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **International Court of Justice** (ICJ; French: Cour internationale de justice, CIJ), 
> or colloquially the World Court, is the only international court 
> that adjudicates general disputes between nations, 
> and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues. 
> It is one of the six organs  of the United Nations (UN), and is located in The Hague, Netherlands.
>
> The ICJ is the successor of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), 
> which was established in 1920 by the League of Nations. 
> After the Second World War, the League and the PCIJ were replaced by the United Nations and ICJ. 
> 
> The Statute of the ICJ, which sets forth its purpose and structure, 
> draws heavily from that of its predecessor, whose decisions remain valid. 
> All member states of the UN are party to the ICJ Statute and may initiate contentious legal cases; 
> however, advisory proceedings may be submitted only by certain UN organs and agencies.
>
> The ICJ consists of a panel of 15 judges 
> elected by the UN General Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms. 
> No more than one judge of each nationality may be represented on court at the same time, 
> and judges collectively must reflect the principal civilizations and legal systems of the world. 
> Seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, 
> the ICJ is the only principal UN organ not located in New York City. 
> Its official working languages are English and French.
>
> Since the entry of its first case on 22 May 1947, 
> the ICJ has entertained 191 cases through 13 November 2023.  
> Pursuant to Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, 
> the court's rulings and opinions are binding on the parties 
> with respect to the particular case ruled on by the court.
