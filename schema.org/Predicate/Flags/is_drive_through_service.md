[ #is_/part_of :: pending: ]

Use these simple Tags to mark Instances as True or False: 
#is_/_/drive_through_service 
#is_/not_/drive_through_service 

Or write it as a Triple: 
[ is_drive_through_service :: Boolean ] 

Indicates whether some facility (e.g. [[FoodEstablishment]], [[CovidTestingFacility]]) offers a service that can be used by driving through in a car. In the case of [[CovidTestingFacility]] such facilities could potentially help with social distancing from other potentially-infected users.

Predicate describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Place ]
( #has_/name :: is_drive_through_service )
( #has_/range :: Boolean )
