Predicate to describe the geo of GeospatialGeometry, Place.

Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/geo/_that_overlaps :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] or 
- [ has_geo_geo_overlaps :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ] 

Represents a relationship between two geometries (or the places they represent), relating a geometry to another that geospatially overlaps it, i.e. they have some but not all points in common. As defined in &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM&quot;&gt;DE-9IM]].

Predicate describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: GeospatialGeometry, Place ]
( #has_/name :: has_geo_location_geo_overlaps )
( #has_/range :: GeospatialGeometry, Place )
