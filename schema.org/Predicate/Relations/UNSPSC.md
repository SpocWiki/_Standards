The¬†**United Nations Standard Products and Services Code¬Æ¬†(UNSPSC¬Æ)**, managed by GS1 US¬Æ¬†for the UN Development Programme (UNDP), is an open, global, multi-sector standard for efficient, accurate classification of products and services.
[UNSPSC](https://www.unspsc.org/)¬†is aTaxonomy propagated by the UN 
There are no correlations among the structure and/or content of UNSPSC and GPC, 
and despite GS1 managing both, they does not provide mapping tables between the Codesets.
