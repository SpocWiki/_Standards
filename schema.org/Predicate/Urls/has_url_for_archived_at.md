Predicate to specify the Url of CreativeWork.

[ #is_/part_of :: pending: ]

Use it like this: 
- [ #has_/url/_for_archived_at :: URL, WebPage ] or 
- [ has_url_for_archived_at :: URL, WebPage ] 

Indicates a page or other link involved in archival of a [[CreativeWork]]. In the case of [[MediaReview]], the items in a [[MediaReviewItem]] may often become inaccessible, but be archived by archival, journalistic, activist, or law enforcement organizations. In such cases, the referenced page may not directly publish the content.

Predicate describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: CreativeWork ]
( #has_/name :: has_url_for_archived_at )
( #has_/range :: URL, WebPage )
