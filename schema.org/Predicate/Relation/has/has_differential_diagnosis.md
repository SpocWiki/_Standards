Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_differential_diagnosis :: DDxElement ] or 
- [ has_differential_diagnosis :: DDxElement ] 

One of a set of differential diagnoses for the condition. Specifically, a closely-related or competing diagnosis typically considered later in the cognitive process whereby this medical condition is distinguished from others most likely responsible for a similar collection of signs and symptoms to reach the most parsimonious diagnosis or diagnoses in a patient.

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: MedicalCondition ]
( #has_/name :: has_differential_diagnosis )
( #has_/range :: DDxElement )
