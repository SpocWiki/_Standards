A <a class="localLink" href="/CriticReview">CriticReview</a> is a more specialized form of Review written or published by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other independent Web sites. <a class="localLink" href="/CriticReview">CriticReview</a>s are typically more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the <a class="localLink" href="/UserReview">UserReview</a> type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.
