<li><a class="localLink" href="/SendAction">SendAction</a>: The reciprocal of ReceiveAction.</li>
<li><a class="localLink" href="/TakeAction">TakeAction</a>: Unlike TakeAction, ReceiveAction does not imply that the ownership has been transferred (e.g. I can receive a package, but it does not mean the package is now mine).</li>
</ul>
