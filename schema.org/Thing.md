Entities are Objects with an Identity, usually a unique Name and/or URL. 
The unique Name allows to add Properties and Relations to them
in a distributed Fashion by defining and collecting S-P-O Triples. 

This is the broadest, most general Class of all Entities AKA Things. 
Schema.org has [a good overview of the Class-Hierarchy](https://schema.org/docs/full.html). 
Things are Objects with a unique Identity so they can be used in Relations 
and have a State with Relations and Attributes that can change over Time.

Subject->Predicate/Property->Value 
Subject->Relation->Object 

Obsidian allows to naturally capture these Triples,
either in the Frontmatter or anywhere in the Text.
