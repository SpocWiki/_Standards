# Type Overview

Types are classes of  Entities/Objects with Identity and defined Properties. 
Types can be used to represent Sets of similar/substitutable Entities. 

They are the Object of the [is_instance_of](Predicate/Relations/is_instance_of.md) Relation to their [Instances](Type/Instance.md). 

Different from Sets in naive Set-Theory, the Instances are usually neither finite nor enumerable 
and thus must be treated specially in inference.
