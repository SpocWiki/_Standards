Proposition/Claims are the smallest possible Statements in Predicate Logic. 
They are the Building-Blocks of the Semantic Web.
Claims can be 'reified' to make Propositions about Propositions.

Propositions consist of 3 Parts forming a so-called Triple: 
- Subject
- Predicate
- Object or Value 

The S-P-O order makes for a nice Reading of Propositions in English.

In Obsidian, the canonical Subject is the current Document. 
Predicates take the form of Verbs or Relations. 

Predicate and Object/Value are sometimes combined into boolean Tags, which are natively supported in Obsidian using the # (Hash) Notation known e.g. from Twitter. 
Tags are problematic though because of their proliferation and missing implicit Semantic. 

Other Document Formats like TRTL (AKA Turtle) allow to specify Triples directly with a formal, but surprisingly readable Syntax similar to natural Language. 

An important Attribute of a Statement is its Factuality, i.e. its Level of 'Truth' measured by experiments with the real world.
Basic Levels of Factuality are 
- Proof 
- Evidence 
- Assumption 
- Question 

> A claim is a statement that one subject, such as a person or organization, makes about a subject. A claim is a debatable statement that an author manifests in a text or theoretical construction, so that the reader accepts it, something that not everyone will accept. 
>
> An objective claim is a statement about a factual matter-one that can be proved true or false.  A subjective claim is not a factual matter; it is an expression of belief, opinion, or personal preference, and cannot be proved right or wrong by any generally accepted criteria.
