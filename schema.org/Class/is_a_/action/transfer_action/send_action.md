#is_/a_/send_action

The act of physically/electronically dispatching an object for transfer from an origin to a destination. Related actions:

<ul>
<li><a class="localLink" href="/ReceiveAction">ReceiveAction</a>: The reciprocal of SendAction.</li>
<li><a class="localLink" href="/GiveAction">GiveAction</a>: Unlike GiveAction, SendAction does not imply the transfer of ownership (e.g. I can send you my laptop, but I'm not necessarily giving it to you).</li>
</ul>
