Included events can relate with the series using the <a class=""localLink"" href=""/superEvent"">superEvent</a> property.<br/><br/>

An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, ""The Olympic Games"" is a series, which
is repeated regularly. The ""2012 London Olympics"" can be presented both as an <a class=""localLink"" href=""/Event"">Event</a> in the series ""Olympic Games"", and as an
<a class=""localLink"" href=""/EventSeries"">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.<br/><br/>

The nature of the association between the events in an <a class=""localLink"" href=""/EventSeries"">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could
include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.<br/><br/>

EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without
worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries
may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but
it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event."
