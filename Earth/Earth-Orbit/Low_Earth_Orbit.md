> A **Low Earth Orbit** (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with a period of 128 minutes or less 
> (making at least 11.25 orbits per day) and an eccentricity less than 0.25. 
> 
> Most of the artificial objects in outer space are in LEO, 
> peaking in number at an altitude around 800 km (500 mi), while the farthest in LEO, 
> before medium Earth orbit (MEO), have an altitude of 2,000 kilometers, 
> about one-third of the radius of Earth and near the beginning of the inner Van Allen radiation belt.
>
> The term LEO region is used for the area of space below an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) (about one-third of Earth's radius). Objects in orbits that pass through this zone, even if they have an apogee further out or are sub-orbital, are carefully tracked since they present a collision risk to the many LEO satellites.
>
> No human spaceflights other than the lunar missions of the Apollo program (1968â€“1972) have gone beyond LEO. Artemis II is also planned to go beyond LEO in early 2026. All space stations to date have operated geocentric within LEO.
