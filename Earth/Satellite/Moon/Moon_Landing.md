## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A Moon landing or lunar landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon, 
> including both crewed and robotic missions. 
> The first human-made object to touch the Moon was Luna 2 in 1959.
>
> In 1969, Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon. There were six crewed landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings. All crewed missions to the Moon were conducted by the Apollo program, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. After Luna 24 in 1976, there were no soft landings on the Moon until Chang'e 3 in 2013. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until January 2019, when Chang'e 4 made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.
