> Sputnik 1 (Russian: Спутник-1, Satellite 1), sometimes referred to as simply Sputnik, 
> was the first artificial Earth satellite. 
> 
> It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 
> as part of the Soviet space program. 
> It sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks 
> before its three silver-zinc batteries became depleted. 
> Aerodynamic drag caused it to fall back into the atmosphere on 4 January 1958.
>
> It was a polished metal sphere 58 cm (23 in) in diameter 
> with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. 
> 
> Its radio signal was easily detectable by amateur radio operators, 
> and the 65° orbital inclination made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth.
>
> The satellite's success was unanticipated by the United States. 
> This precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race. 
> The launch was the beginning of a 
> new era of political, military, technological, and scientific developments. 
> The word sputnik is Russian for satellite when interpreted in an astronomical context; 
> its other meanings are spouse or travelling companion.
>
> Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. 
> The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, 
> and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.
>
> Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, 
> at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). 
> 
> The satellite travelled at a peak speed of about 8 km/s (18,000 mph), 
> taking 96.20 minutes to complete each orbit. 
> 
> It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, 
> which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. 
> 
> The signals continued for 22 days until the transmitter batteries depleted on 26 October 1957. 
> On 4 January 1958, after three months in orbit, 
> Sputnik 1 burned up while reentering Earth's atmosphere, 
> having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth, 
> and travelling a distance of approximately 70,000,000 km (43,000,000 mi).
