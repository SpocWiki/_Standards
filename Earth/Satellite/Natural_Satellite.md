> A natural satellite is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body 
> that orbits a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body 
> (or sometimes another natural satellite). 
> 
> Natural satellites are colloquially referred to as moons, a derivation from the Moon of Earth.
>
> In the Solar System, there are six planetary satellite systems, 
> altogether comprising 419 natural satellites with confirmed orbits. 
> 
> Seven objects commonly considered dwarf planets by astronomers 
> are also known to have natural satellites: Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, and Eris. 
> 
> As of January 2022, there are 447 other minor planets known to have natural satellites.
>
> A planet usually has at least around 10,000 times the mass of any natural satellites that orbit it, 
> with a correspondingly much larger diameter. 
> 
> The Earth–Moon system is a unique exception in the Solar System; 
> at 3,474 kilometres (2,158 miles) across, 
> the Moon is 0.273 times the diameter of Earth 
> and about 1⁄80 of its mass. 
> 
> The next largest ratios are 
> - the Neptune–Triton system at 0.055 (with a mass ratio of about 1 to 4790), 
> - the Saturn–Titan system at 0.044 (with the second mass ratio, 1 to 4225), 
> - the Jupiter–Ganymede system at 0.038 (with a mass ratio of 12810), and 
> - the Uranus–Titania system at 0.031 (with a mass ratio of 25125). 
> 
> For the category of dwarf planets, 
> Charon has the largest ratio, being 0.52 the diameter and 12.2% the mass of Pluto.
