> Darién Gap (UK: , US: , Spanish: Tapón del Darién, lit. 'Darién plug') 
> is a geographic region in the Isthmus of Darién or Isthmus of Panama 
> connecting the American continents within Central America, 
> consisting of a large watershed, forest, and mountains 
> in Panama's Darién Province 
> and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department.
>
> The Darién Gap is home to the Embera-Wounaan and Guna people 
> and was also home to the Cueva people who became extinct by 1535, 
> following the Spanish invasion of Panama. 
> 
> Travel is often conducted with pirogues. 
> On the Panamanian side, La Palma, the area's cultural center, 
> is the capital of the province. 
> Other population centers include Yaviza and El Real. 
> The Darién Gap had a reported population of 8,000 in 1995 among five tribes. 
> Maize, cassava, plantains, and bananas are staple crops on local farms.
>
> The geography of the Darién Gap on the Colombian side 
> is dominated primarily by the river delta of the Atrato River, 
> which creates a flat marshland at least 80 km (50 mi) wide. 
> 
> The Serranía del Baudó range extends along Colombia's Pacific coast and into Panama. 
> The Panamanian side, in stark contrast, is a mountainous rainforest, 
> with terrain reaching from 60 m (197 ft) in the valley floors to 1,845 m (6,053 ft) 
> at the tallest peak (Cerro Tacarcuna, in the Serranía del Darién).
>
> There is no road, not even a primitive one, across the Darién. 
> The "Gap" interrupts the [[Pan-American_Highway]]. 
> Some 106 km (66 mi) of this between Yaviza, Panama, and Turbo, Colombia, 
> has never been built. 
> 
> Road-building in this area is both expensive and detrimental to the environment. 
> Political consensus in favor of road construction collapsed 
> after an initial attempt failed in the early 1970s, 
> with a proposal in the early 1990s halted by environmental concerns. 
> 
> As of 2024, there was no active plan to build a road through the Gap, 
> although there has been discussion of reestablishing a ferry service. 
> One can bypass it by boat, and for some years there was an underused ferry service. 
> The remaining option is to hike from Colombia to Panama by trail, 
> which is possible but very strenuous and dangerous. 
> Heavy rain and flash floods are frequent, law enforcement 
> and medical support are non-existent, rapes and robberies are common, 
> and a broken leg can be fatal, as there is no way to reach assistance. 
> 
> However, this route has been taken by hundreds of thousands of migrants 
> since the 2010s, primarily Haitians and Venezuelans, 
> to reach the Mexico–United States border. 
> 
> By 2021, the number was more than 130,000. 
> In 2022, there were 250,000, and 
> by mid-September, 2023, 360,000 had crossed the Gap. 
> In 2023, an increasing number of Asian and African migrants 
> are attempting to cross the Gap.
