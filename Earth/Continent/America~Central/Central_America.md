> Central America is a subregion of North America. 
> Its political boundaries are defined as bordering Mexico to the north, 
> Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. 
> 
> Central America is usually defined as consisting of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. 
> Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, 
> which extends from southern Mexico to southeastern Panama. 
> 
> Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, 
> there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, 
> which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage.
>
> Most of Central America falls under the Isthmo-Colombian cultural area. 
> Before the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the Americas, hundreds of indigenous peoples made their homes in the area. From 1502 onwards, Spain began their colonization. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy Juan de O'Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which established New Spain's independence and autonomy from mainland Spain. On 15 September, the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the Spanish Empire. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region were invaded and annexed to the First Mexican Empire; however in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America until 1838.
>
> In 1838, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent countries, followed by El Salvador in 1841, Panama in 1903, and Belize in 1981. Despite the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America, the five remaining countries, save for Panama and Belize, all preserved and maintained a Central American identity.
>
> The Spanish-speaking countries officially include both North America and South America as a single continent, América, which is split into four subregions: Central America, The Caribbean (a.k.a. the West Indies), North America (Mexico and Northern America), and South America.
