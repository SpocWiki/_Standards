> Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 [O.S. January 6, 1705] – April 17, 1790) was an American [[../../../../_Standards/Science/Polymath|Polymath]]: 
> a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. 
> 
> Among the most influential intellectuals of his time, 
> Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States; 
> a drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence; and the **first postmaster general**.
>
> Born in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, 
> Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, 
> the leading city in the colonies, publishing The Pennsylvania Gazette at age 23. 
> 
> He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard's Almanack, 
> which he wrote under the pseudonym "Richard Saunders". 
> 
> After 1767, he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle, 
> a newspaper known for its revolutionary sentiments 
> and criticisms of the policies of the British Parliament and the Crown. 
> 
> He pioneered and was the first president of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, 
> which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. 
> 
> He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society 
> and was elected its president in 1769. 
> 
> He was appointed deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, 
> which enabled him to set up the first national communications network.
>
> Franklin was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, 
> as well as national and international affairs. 
> 
> He became a hero in America when, as an agent in London for several colonies, 
> he spearheaded the repeal of the unpopular Stamp Act by the British Parliament. 
> 
> An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France 
> and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco–American relations. 
> 
> His efforts proved vital in securing French aid for the American Revolution. 
> 
> From 1785 to 1788, he served as **President of Pennsylvania**. 
> 
> At some points in his life, he owned slaves and ran "for sale" ads for slaves in his newspaper, 
> but by the late 1750s, he began arguing against slavery, became an active abolitionist, 
> and promoted the education and integration of African Americans into U.S. society.
>
> As a scientist, Franklin's studies of electricity 
> made him a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics. 
> He also charted and named the Gulf Stream current. 
> His numerous important inventions include the lightning rod, bifocals, glass harmonica and the Franklin stove. 
> He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, 
> Philadelphia's first fire department, and the University of Pennsylvania.
>
> Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity. 
> He was the only person to sign the Declaration of Independence, 
> the Treaty of Paris peace with Britain, and the Constitution. 
> 
> Foundational in defining the American ethos, 
> Franklin has been called "the most accomplished American of his age 
> and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become".
>
> Franklin's life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, 
> and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, 
> have seen him honored for more than two centuries after his death on the $100 bill 
> and in the names of warships, many towns and counties, educational institutions and corporations, 
> as well as in numerous cultural references and a portrait in the Oval Office. 
> 
> His more than 30,000 letters and documents have been collected in The Papers of Benjamin Franklin. 
> Anne Robert Jacques Turgot said of him: "Eripuit fulmen cœlo, mox sceptra tyrannis" 
> ("He snatched lightning from the sky and the scepter from tyrants").
