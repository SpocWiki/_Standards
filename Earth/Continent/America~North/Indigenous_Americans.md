> The Indigenous peoples of the Americas are the peoples 
> who are native to the Americas or the Western Hemisphere. 
> 
> Their ancestors are among the pre-Columbian population of South or North America, 
> including Central America and the Caribbean. 
> Indigenous peoples live throughout the Americas. 
> While often minorities in their countries, Indigenous peoples are the majority 
> in Greenland and close to a majority in Bolivia and Guatemala.
>
> There are at least 1,000 different Indigenous languages of the Americas. 
> Some languages, including Quechua, Arawak, Aymara, Guaraní, Nahuatl, 
> and some Mayan languages, have millions of speakers 
> and are recognized as official by governments in Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, and Greenland. 
>
> Indigenous peoples, whether residing in rural or urban areas, 
> often maintain aspects of their cultural practices, 
> including religion, social organization, and subsistence practices. 
> Over time, these cultures have evolved, preserving traditional customs 
> while adapting to modern needs. 
> Some Indigenous groups remain relatively isolated from Western culture, 
> with some still classified as uncontacted peoples.
>
> The Americas also host millions of individuals of mixed Indigenous, European, and sometimes African or Asian descent, historically referred to as mestizos in Spanish-speaking countries. In many Latin American nations, people of partial Indigenous descent constitute a majority or significant portion of the population, particularly in Central America, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and Paraguay. Mestizos outnumber Indigenous peoples in most Spanish-speaking countries, according to estimates of ethnic cultural identification. However, since Indigenous communities in the Americas are defined by cultural identification and kinship rather than ancestry or race, mestizos are typically not counted among the Indigenous population unless they speak an Indigenous language or identify with a specific Indigenous culture. Additionally, many individuals of wholly Indigenous descent who do not follow Indigenous traditions or speak an Indigenous language have been classified or self-identified as mestizo due to assimilation into the dominant Hispanic culture. In recent years, the self-identified Indigenous population in many countries has increased as individuals reclaim their heritage amid rising Indigenous-led movements for self-determination and social justice.
>
> In past centuries, Indigenous peoples had diverse societal, governmental, and subsistence systems. Some Indigenous peoples were historically hunter-gatherers, while others practiced agriculture and aquaculture. Various Indigenous societies developed complex social structures, including precontact monumental architecture, organized cities, city-states, chiefdoms, states, monarchies, republics, confederacies, and empires. These societies possessed varying levels of knowledge in fields such as engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, agriculture, irrigation, geology, mining, metallurgy, art, sculpture, and goldsmithing.
