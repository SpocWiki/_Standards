## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms 
> that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies 
> during the 1930s. 
> 
> The phenomenon was caused by a combination of natural factors (severe drought) 
> and human-made factors: a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion, 
> most notably the destruction of the natural topsoil by settlers in the region. 
> 
> The drought came in three waves: 1934, 1936, and 1939â€“1940, 
> but some regions of the High Plains experienced drought conditions for as long as eight years. 
> It exacerbated an already existing agricultural recession.
>
> The Dust Bowl has been the subject of many cultural works, including John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath; the Dust Bowl Ballads of Woody Guthrie; and Dorothea Lange's photographs depicting the conditions of migrants, particularly Migrant Mother, taken in 1936.
