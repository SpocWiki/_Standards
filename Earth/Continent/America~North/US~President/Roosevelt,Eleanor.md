> Anna **Eleanor Roosevelt** ( EL-in-or ROH-zə-velt; October 11, 1884 – November 7, 1962) 
> was an American political figure, diplomat, and activist. 
> 
> She was the longest-serving first lady of the United States, 
> during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms as president from 1933 to 1945. 
> 
> Through her travels, public engagement, and advocacy, she largely redefined the role. 
> 
> Widowed in 1945, she served as a US delegate to the United Nations General Assembly 
> from 1945 to 1952, 
> and took a leading role in designing the text and gaining international support for 
> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
> 
> In 1948, she was given standing ovation by the assembly upon the adoption of the declaration. 
> President Harry S. Truman later called her the "First Lady of the World" 
> in tribute to her human rights achievements.
>
> Roosevelt was a member of the prominent and wealthy Roosevelt and Livingston families 
> and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. 
> 
> She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents 
> and one of her brothers at a young age. 
> 
> At 15, she attended Allenswood Boarding Academy in London 
> and was deeply influenced by its founder and director Marie Souvestre. 
> 
> Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, 
> Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. 
> Between 1906 and 1916 she gave birth to six children, one of whom died in infancy. 
> 
> The Roosevelts' marriage became complicated 
> after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with her social secretary, Lucy Mercer, in 1918. 
> 
> Due to mediation by her mother-in-law, Sara, the liaison was ended officially. 
> After that, both partners started to keep independent agendas, 
> and Eleanor joined the Women's Trade Union League 
> and became active in the New York state Democratic Party. 
> 
> Roosevelt helped persuade her husband 
> to stay in politics after he was stricken with a paralytic illness in 1921. 
> Following Franklin's election as governor of New York in 1928, 
> and throughout the remainder of Franklin's political career, 
> Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf; 
> and as first lady, while her husband served as president, 
> she greatly influenced the present scope and future of the role.
>
> Roosevelt was, in her time, one of the world's most widely admired and powerful women. 
> Nevertheless, in her early years in the White House she was controversial for her outspokenness, 
> particularly with respect to her promotion of civil rights for African Americans. 
> 
> She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, 
> write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, 
> and speak at a national party convention. 
> On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. 
> She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, 
> for the families of unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. 
> She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, 
> the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, 
> and the rights of World War II refugees.
>
> Following her husband's death in 1945, 
> Roosevelt pressed the United States to join and support the United Nations 
> and became its first delegate to the committee on Human Rights. 
> She served as the first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights 
> and oversaw the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
> 
> Later, she chaired the John F. Kennedy administration's 
> Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. 
> 
> By the time of her death, Roosevelt was regarded as 
> "one of the most esteemed women in the world"; 
> The New York Times called her "the object of almost universal respect" in her obituary. 
> In 1999, Roosevelt was ranked ninth in the top ten of 
> Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century, 
> and was found to rank as the most admired woman in thirteen different years 
> between 1948 and 1961 in Gallup's annual most admired woman poll. 
> 
> Periodic surveys conducted by the Siena College Research Institute 
> have consistently seen historians assess Roosevelt as the greatest American first lady.
