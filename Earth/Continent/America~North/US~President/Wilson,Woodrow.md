> which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax.

> and left military matters to the generals. 
> He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the Fourteen Points 
> that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. 
> 
> He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies,

> where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference. 
> 
> Wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, 
> the[[../../../../../_Standards/UN(United_Nations)/League_of_Nations|League_of_Nations]]]. 
> It was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles that he signed. 
> Wilson had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris talks, 
> and back home he rejected a Republican compromise 
> that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League.
>
> Wilson had intended to seek a third term in office 
> but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left him incapacitated. 
> His wife and his physician controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. 
> Meanwhile, his policies alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats 
> and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. 
> 
> Scholars have generally ranked Wilson in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, 
> although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. 
> His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, 
> and his vision of national self-determination resonated globally to this day.
