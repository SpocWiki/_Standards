Wilson led the United States into World War I in 1917-04-01, although in his Campaign he was propagating the opposite
until his re-election in 1917-03-01. 
He pushed this new Agenda using both Punishments and by[[../../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/War-Theater/Cognitive-Force/Propaganda.internal|Propaganda.internal]]]. 
He established the [[Creel-Commission]] to foster the war-effort. 

The new Slogan was "A War to end all Wars". 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Thomas **Woodrow Wilson** (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) 
> was an American politician and academic 
> who served as the 28th president of the United States from 1913 to 1921. 
> 
> A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the president of Princeton University 
> and as the governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. 
> 
> As president, Wilson changed the nation's economic policies 
> and led the United States into World War I in 1917, 
> although in his Campaign he was propagating the opposite. 
> He was the leading architect of the[[../../../../../_Standards/UN(United_Nations)/League_of_Nations]]], 
> and his progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as [[Wilsonianism]].
>
> Born in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson grew up in the Southern United States, 
> mainly in Augusta, Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era. 
> After earning a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) 
> in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, 
> Wilson taught at several colleges 
> prior to being appointed president of Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, 
> where he emerged as a prominent spokesman for progressivism in higher education. 
>
> Wilson served as governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, 
> during which he broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. 
> To win the 1912 presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and Southerners 
> to his cause at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. 
> Wilson defeated incumbent Republican William Howard Taft 
> and third-party nominee Theodore Roosevelt 
> to easily win the 1912 United States presidential election, 
> becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. 
> 
> During his first year as president, 
> Wilson authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy. 
> He ousted many African Americans from federal posts 
> and his opposition to women's suffrage drew protests. 
> 
> His first term was largely devoted to 
> pursuing passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. 
> His first major priority was the Revenue Act of 1913, 
> which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax. 
> 
> Wilson also negotiated the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, 
> which created the Federal Reserve System. 
> Two major laws, the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] and the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], 
> were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power.
>
> At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the U.S. declared neutrality 
> as Wilson tried to negotiate a peace between the Allied and Central Powers. 
> 
> He narrowly won re-election in the 1916 United States presidential election, 
> boasting how he kept the nation out of wars in Europe and Mexico. 
> 
> In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to 
> its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. 
> Wilson nominally presided over war-time mobilization 
> and left military matters to the generals. 
> He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the Fourteen Points 
> that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. 
> 
> He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies, 
> but instead the Republicans took control of Congress. 
> After the Allied victory in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris 
> where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference. 
> 
> Wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, 
> the[[../../../../../_Standards/UN(United_Nations)/League_of_Nations|League_of_Nations]]]. 
> It was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles that he signed. 
> Wilson had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris talks, 
> and back home he rejected a Republican compromise 
> that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League.
>
> Wilson had intended to seek a third term in office 
> but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left him incapacitated. 
> His wife and his physician controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. 
> Meanwhile, his policies alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats 
> and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. 
> 
> Scholars have generally ranked Wilson in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, 
> although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. 
> His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, 
> and his vision of national self-determination resonated globally to this day.
