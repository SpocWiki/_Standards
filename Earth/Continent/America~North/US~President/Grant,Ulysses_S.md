## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant; April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) 
> was the 18th president of the United States, serving from 1869 to 1877. 
> In 1865, as commanding general, 
> Grant led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War.
>
> Grant was born in Ohio 
> and graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1843. 
> 
> He served with distinction in the Mexican–American War, 
> but resigned from the army in 1854 and returned to civilian life **impoverished**. 
> 
> In 1861, shortly after the Civil War began, Grant joined the Union Army, 
> and he rose to prominence after securing victories in the western theater in 1862. 
> 
> In 1863, he led the Vicksburg campaign 
> that gave Union forces control of the Mississippi River 
> and dealt a major strategic blow to the Confederacy. 
> 
> President Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general 
> and command of all Union armies after his victory at Chattanooga. 
> 
> For thirteen months, Grant fought Robert E. Lee during the high-casualty Overland Campaign, which ended when Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox. 
> 
> In 1866, President Andrew Johnson promoted Grant to General of the Army. 
> Later, Grant broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies. 
> A war hero, drawn in by his sense of duty, 
> Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party 
> and then elected president in 1868.
>
> As president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, 
> supported congressional Reconstruction and the Fifteenth Amendment, 
> and prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan. 
> 
> Under Grant, the Union was completely restored. 
> An effective civil rights executive, Grant signed a bill 
> to create the United States Department of Justice 
> and worked with Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction. 
> 
> In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission, 
> advancing the civil service more than any prior president. 
> 
> Grant was re-elected in the 1872 presidential election, 
> but was inundated by executive scandals during his second term. 
> 
> His response to the Panic of 1873 was ineffective in halting the [[Long_Depression]], 
> which contributed to the Democrats winning the House majority in 1874. 
> 
> Grant's Native American policy was to assimilate Indians into Anglo-American culture. 
> 
> In Grant's foreign policy, the Alabama Claims against Britain were peacefully resolved, 
> but the Senate rejected his proposal to annex Santo Domingo. 
> 
> In the disputed 1876 presidential election, 
> he facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise.
>
> Leaving office in 1877, Grant undertook a world tour, 
> becoming the first president to circumnavigate the world. 
> 
> In 1880, he was unsuccessful 
> in obtaining the Republican nomination for a non-consecutive third term. 
> 
> In 1885, **impoverished and dying of throat cancer**, Grant wrote his memoirs, 
> covering his life through the Civil War, which were posthumously published 
> and became a major critical and financial success. 
> 
> At his death, Grant was the most popular American 
> and was memorialized as a symbol of national unity. 
> 
> Due to the pseudohistorical and negationist 
> mythology of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy 
> spread by Confederate sympathizers around the turn of the 20th century, 
> historical assessments and rankings of Grant's presidency suffered considerably 
> before they began recovering in the 21st century. 
> 
> Grant's critics take a negative view of his economic mismanagement 
> and the corruption within his administration, 
> while his admirers emphasize his policy towards Native Americans, 
> vigorous enforcement of civil and voting rights for African Americans, 
> and securing North and South as a single nation within the Union. 
> 
> 21st century scholarship has praised Grant's appointments of Cabinet reformers.
