> Martin Van Buren (Dutch: Maarten van Buren; December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) 
> was an American lawyer, diplomat, and statesman 
> who served as the eighth president of the United States from 1837 to 1841. 
> 
> A primary founder of the Democratic Party, 
> he served as New York's attorney general and U.S. senator, 
> then briefly as the ninth governor of New York 
> before joining Andrew Jackson's administration as the tenth United States secretary of state, 
> minister to Great Britain, and ultimately the eighth vice president 
> when named Jackson's running mate for the 1832 election. 
> 
> Van Buren won the presidency in 1836 against divided Whig opponents. 
> Van Buren lost re-election in 1840, and failed to win the Democratic nomination in 1844. 
> Later in his life, Van Buren emerged as an elder statesman 
> and an important anti-slavery leader 
> who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848 presidential election.
>
> Van Buren was born in Kinderhook, New York, 
> where most residents were of Dutch descent and spoke Dutch as their primary language; 
> he is the only president to have spoken English as a second language. 
> 
> Trained as a lawyer, he entered politics as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, 
> won a seat in the New York State Senate, and was elected to the United States Senate in 1821. 
> 
> As the leader of the Bucktails faction, 
> Van Buren emerged as the most influential politician from New York in the 1820s 
> and established a political machine known as the Albany Regency. 
> 
> He ran successfully for governor of New York 
> to support Andrew Jackson's candidacy in the 1828 presidential election 
> but resigned shortly after Jackson was inaugurated 
> so he could accept appointment as Jackson's secretary of state. 
> 
> In the cabinet, Van Buren was a key Jackson advisor 
> and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party. 
> 
> He ultimately resigned to help resolve the Petticoat affair 
> and briefly served as ambassador to Great Britain. 
> 
> At Jackson's behest, 
> the 1832 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren for vice president, 
> and he took office after the Democratic ticket won the 1832 presidential election.
>
> With Jackson's strong support and the organizational strength of the Democratic Party, 
> Van Buren successfully ran for president in the 1836 presidential election. 
> However, his popularity soon eroded because of his response to the Panic of 1837, 
> which centered on his Independent Treasury system, a plan under which 
> the federal government of the United States would store its funds in vaults rather than banks; 
> more conservative Democrats and Whigs in Congress 
> ultimately delayed his plan from being implemented until 1840. 
> 
> His presidency was further marred by the costly Second Seminole War 
> and his refusal to admit Texas to the Union as a slave state. 
> 
> In 1840, Van Buren lost his re-election bid to William Henry Harrison. 
> While Van Buren is praised for anti-slavery stances, in historical rankings, historians 
> and political scientists often rank Van Buren as an average or below-average U.S. president, 
> due to his handling of the Panic of 1837.
>
> Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination again in 1844, 
> but his continued opposition to the annexation of Texas angered Southern Democrats, 
> leading to the nomination of James K. Polk. 
> 
> Growing opposed to slavery, 
> Van Buren was the newly formed Free Soil Party's presidential nominee in 1848, 
> and his candidacy helped Whig nominee Zachary Taylor defeat Democrat Lewis Cass. 
> 
> Worried about sectional tensions, Van Buren returned to the Democratic Party after 1848 
> but was disappointed with the pro-southern presidencies of Franklin Pierce 
> and James Buchanan. 
> 
> During the American Civil War, Van Buren was a War Democrat 
> who supported the policies of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican. 
> He died of asthma at his home in Kinderhook in 1862, aged 79.
