> The **Long Depression** was a worldwide price and economic recession, 
> beginning in 1873 and lasting until either March 1879, 
> or the year 1899, depending on the metrics used. 
> 
> It was most severe in Europe and North America, 
> which had been experiencing strong economic growth 
> fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution. 
> 
> The episode was labeled the "Great Depression" at the time, 
> and it held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
> Though it marked a period of general deflation and recession, 
> it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the later Great Depression.
>
> The United Kingdom was the hardest hit; during this period 
> it lost some of its large industrial lead over the economies of continental Europe.   
> 
> While it was occurring, the view was prominent that the British economy 
> had been in continuous depression from 1873 to as late as 1896 
> and some texts refer to the period as the Great Depression of 1873–1896, 
> with financial and manufacturing losses reinforced by a long recession in the agricultural sector.
>
> In the United States, historians refer to the long depression as 
> The Depression of 1873–1879, 
> focusing on the Panic of 1873, and the Panic of 1893. 
> 
> The U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research dates 
> the contraction following the panic as lasting from October 1873 to March 1879.  
> 
> At 65 months, it is the longest-lasting contraction identified by the NBER, 
> eclipsing the Great Depression's 43 months of contraction.  
> In the United States, from 1873 to 1879, 
> 18,000 businesses went bankrupt, including 89 railroads.  
> Unemployment peaked in 1878 at 8.25%.
