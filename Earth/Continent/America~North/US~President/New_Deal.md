> The New Deal was a series of wide-reaching economic, social, and political reforms 
> enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1938, 
> in response to the Great Depression, which had started in 1929. 
> 
> Roosevelt introduced the phrase 
> upon accepting the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1932 
> before winning the election in a landslide over incumbent Herbert Hoover, 
> whose administration was viewed by many as doing too little to help those affected. 
> 
> Roosevelt believed that the depression was caused by inherent market instability 
> and too little demand per the Keynesian model of economics 
> and that massive government intervention was necessary 
> to stabilize and rationalize the economy.
>
> During Roosevelt's first hundred days in office in 1933 until 1935, 
> he introduced what historians refer to as the "First New Deal", which focused on the "3 R's": 
> - relief for the unemployed and for the poor, 
> - recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and 
> - reforms of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. 
> 
> Roosevelt signed the Emergency Banking Act, 
> which authorized the Federal Reserve to insure deposits to restore confidence, 
> and the 1933 Banking Act made this permanent 
> with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
> 
> Other laws created the National Recovery Administration (NRA), 
> which allowed industries to create "codes of fair competition"; 
> - the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
>   which protected investors from abusive stock market practices; and 
> - the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), 
>   which raised rural incomes by controlling production. 
> 
> Public works were undertaken in order to find jobs for the unemployed 
> (25 percent of the workforce when Roosevelt took office): 
> - the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) enlisted young men 
>   for manual labor on government land, and 
> - the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) promoted electricity generation 
>   and other forms of economic development in the drainage basin of the Tennessee River.
>
> Although the First New Deal helped many find work 
> and restored confidence in the financial system, 
> by 1935 stock prices were still below pre-Depression levels 
> and unemployment still exceeded 20 percent. 
> 
> From 1935 to 1938, the "Second New Deal" introduced further legislation 
> and additional agencies which focused on job creation 
> and on improving the conditions of the elderly, workers, and the poor. 
> 
> The Works Progress Administration (WPA) 
> supervised the construction of bridges, libraries, parks, and other facilities, 
> while also investing in the arts; 
> the National Labor Relations Act guaranteed employees the right to organize trade unions; 
> and the Social Security Act introduced pensions for senior citizens 
> and benefits for the disabled, mothers with dependent children, and the unemployed. 
> The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibited "oppressive" child labor, 
> and enshrined a 40-hour work week and national minimum wage.
>
> In 1938, the Republican Party gained seats in Congress 
> and joined with conservative Democrats to block further New Deal legislation, 
> and some of it was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. 
> 
> The New Deal produced a political realignment, 
> reorienting the Democratic Party's base to the New Deal coalition of 
> - labor unions, 
> - blue-collar workers, 
> - big city machines, 
> - racial minorities (most importantly African-Americans), 
> - white Southerners, and 
> - intellectuals. 
> 
> The realignment crystallized into a powerful liberal coalition 
> which dominated presidential elections into the 1960s, 
> as an opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress 
> in domestic affairs from 1939 onwards. 
> 
> Historians still debate the effectiveness of the New Deal programs, 
> although most accept that full employment was not achieved until World War II began in 1939.
