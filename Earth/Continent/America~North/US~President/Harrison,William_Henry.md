> an American military victory that ended the Northwest Indian War. 
> 
> Later, he led a military force against Tecumseh's confederacy 
> at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, where he earned the nickname "Old Tippecanoe". 
> He was promoted to major general in the Army during the War of 1812, 
> and led American infantry and cavalry to victory at the Battle of the Thames in Upper Canada.
>
> Harrison's political career began in 1798, 
> with an appointment as secretary of the Northwest Territory. 
> In 1799, he was elected as the territory's non-voting delegate 
> in the United States House of Representatives. 
> He became governor of the newly established Indiana Territory in 1801 
> and negotiated multiple treaties with American Indian tribes, 
> with the nation acquiring millions of acres. 
> 
> After the War of 1812, he moved to Ohio where, in 1816, 
> he was elected to represent the state's 1st district in the House of Representatives. 
> In 1824, he was elected to the United States Senate, though his Senate term was cut short 
> by his appointment as Minister Plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia in 1828.
>
> Harrison returned to private life in North Bend, Ohio, 
> until he was nominated as one of several Whig Party nominees for president 
> in the 1836 United States presidential election; 
> he was defeated by Democratic vice president Martin Van Buren. 
> 
> Four years later, the party nominated him again, with John Tyler as his running mate, 
> under the campaign slogan "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too". 
> Harrison defeated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election. 
> 
> Just three weeks after his inauguration, Harrison fell ill and died days later. 
> After resolution of an ambiguity in the constitution 
> regarding succession to the powers and duties of the office, Tyler became president. 
> 
> Harrison is often omitted in historical presidential rankings due to his brief tenure 
> and placed significantly below average when he is included. 
> However, he is remembered for his Indian entreaties, 
> and also his inventive election campaign tactics.
