## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The president of the United States (POTUS) is the head of state and head of government of the United States. 
> The president directs the executive branch of the federal government 
> and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.
>
> The power of the presidency has grown since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. 
> While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, 
> the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the 20th century, 
> carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. 
> 
> In the 21st century, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures 
> and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. 
> As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, 
> the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. 
> For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, 
> the U.S. president was often called "the leader of the free world".
>
> Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government 
> and vests executive power in the president. 
> The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law 
> and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. 
> Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors 
> and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, 
> the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. 
> The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, 
> which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.
>
> The president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. 
> As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution 
> gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. 
> 
> Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, 
> major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, 
> with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress 
> who are often electorally dependent on the president. 
> Over time, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, 
> and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.
>
> The president is elected through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. 
> Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, 
> no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. 
> In addition, nine vice presidents have become president 
> by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation. 
> 
> In all, 45 individuals have served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms. 
> Donald Trump is the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.
