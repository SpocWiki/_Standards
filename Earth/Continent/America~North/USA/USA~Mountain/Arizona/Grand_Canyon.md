> The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States. 
> The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide 
> and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters).
>
> The canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, 
> the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument, 
> the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. 
> President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of the preservation of the Grand Canyon area 
> and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.
>
> Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River 
> and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock 
> while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. 
> While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, 
> several recent studies support the hypothesis that 
> the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago. 
> Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries 
> and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.
>
> For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, 
> who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. 
> The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. 
> The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was García López de Cárdenas 
> from Spain, who arrived in 1540.
