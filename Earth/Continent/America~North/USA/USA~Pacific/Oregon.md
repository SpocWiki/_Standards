> **Oregon** (  ORR-ih-ghən) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. 
> Oregon is a part of the Western United States, with the 
> Columbia River delineating much of Oregon's northern boundary with Washington, 
> while the Snake River delineates much of its eastern boundary with Idaho. 
> The 42° north parallel delineates the southern boundary with California and Nevada. 
> The western boundary is formed by the Pacific Ocean.
>
> Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of years. 
> The first European traders, explorers, and settlers 
> began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early to mid-16th century. 
> As early as 1564, the Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, 
> riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular route across the northern Pacific. 
> In 1592, Juan de Fuca undertook detailed mapping and 
> studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast 
> as well as the strait now bearing his name. 
> 
> The Lewis and Clark Expedition traversed Oregon in the early 1800s, 
> and the first permanent European settlements in Oregon were established by fur trappers and traders. 
> In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country, 
> and the Oregon Territory was created in 1848. 
> Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859.

> Oregon is also one of the most geographically diverse states in the U.S., 
> marked by volcanoes, abundant bodies of water, dense evergreen and mixed forests, 
> as well as high deserts and semi-arid shrublands.
