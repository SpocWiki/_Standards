Before 1959, Alaska's status as a U.S. territory meant 
that it had a degree of self-governance but __lacked full representation in Congress__ 
and the ability to participate in presidential elections.

Despite its Size, 99.99% of Alaska use the same [[Time-Zone]], nearly exclusively: 
UTC-9 is still 1 hour ahead of the geographical Time, 
but only 1 hour behind the UTC-8 used from California up to and including Western [[Canada]].

## #has_/text_of_/abstract  


> **Alaska** is a non-contiguous U.S. state on the northwest extremity of North America. 
> It borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the Yukon territory  to the east; 
> it shares a western maritime border in the Bering Strait 
> with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. 
> The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean lie to the north 
> and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. 
> Technically a semi-exclave of the U.S., it is the largest exclave in the world.
>
> Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area 
> than the next three largest states of Texas, California and Montana combined, 
> and is the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. 
> 
> It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, 
> but is, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, the continent's most populous territory 
> located mostly north of the 60th parallel, 
> with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.  
> 
> The state contains the second-largest and largest cities in the United States by area: 
> the state capital of Juneau, and its former capital, Sitka, respectively. 
> The state's most populous city is Anchorage 
> and approximately half of Alaska's residents live within its metropolitan area.
>
> Indigenous people have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, 
> and it is widely believed that the region served as the entry point 
> for the initial settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. 
> 
> The Russian Empire was the first to colonize the area beginning in the 18th century, 
> eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state, 
> and promoted and maintained a native Alaskan Creole population. 
> The expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its 
> sale to the U.S. in 1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to $157 million in 2023). 
> The area went through several administrative changes 
> before becoming organized as a territory on May 11, 1912. 
> It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.
>
> Abundant natural resources have enabled Alaska—
> with one of the smallest state economies—to have one of the highest per capita incomes, 
> with commercial fishing, and the extraction of natural gas and oil, dominating it's economy. U.S. Armed Forces bases and tourism also contribute to the economy; 
> more than half the state is federally-owned land containing national forests, 
> national parks, and wildlife refuges. It is among the most irreligious states, 
> one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana, 
> and is known for its libertarian-leaning political culture, 
> generally supporting the Republican Party in national elections. 
> The Indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the second highest of any U.S. state, 
> at over 15 percent, after only Hawaii.
