> **Seattle** (see-AT-əl) is the most populous city 
> in the U.S. state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. 
> 
> It is the 18th-most populous city in the United States with a population of 780,995 in 2024, 
> while the Seattle metropolitan area at over 4.15 million residents 
> is the 15th-most populous metropolitan area in the nation. 
> 
> The city is the county seat of King County, the most populous county in Washington. 
> Seattle's growth rate of 21.1% between 2010 and 2020 made it 
> one of the country's fastest-growing large cities.
>
> Seattle is situated on an isthmus 
> between Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. 
> 
> It is the northernmost major city in the United States, 
> located about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canadian border. 
> 
> A gateway for trade with East Asia, the Port of Seattle 
> is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2021.
>
> The Seattle area has been inhabited by Native Americans (such as the Duwamish, who had at least 17 villages around Elliot Bay) for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay in 1852 and named "Seattle" in honor of Chief Seattle, a prominent 19th-century leader of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. Seattle currently has relatively high populations of Native Americans as well as Americans with strong Asian, African, European, and Scandinavian ancestry, and, as of 2015, hosts the fifth-highest percentage of residents who identify as LGBT among major metropolitan areas in the U.S. (4.8 percent).

> Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. The city grew after World War II, partly due to the local company Boeing, which established Seattle as a center for its manufacturing of aircraft. Beginning in the 1980s, the Seattle area developed into a technology center; Microsoft established its headquarters in the region. Alaska Airlines is based at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in SeaTac, Washington. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 in the decade between 1990 and 2000.
>
> The culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the city also was the origin of several rock artists, including Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, and the subgenre of grunge and its pioneering bands, including Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and others.
