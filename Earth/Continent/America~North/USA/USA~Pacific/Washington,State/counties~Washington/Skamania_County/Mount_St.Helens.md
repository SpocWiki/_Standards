> Mount St. Helens (known as Lawetlat'la to the local Cowlitz people, and Loowit or Louwala-Clough to the Klickitat) is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County, Washington, 
> in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. 
> 
> It lies 52 miles (83 km) northeast of Portland, Oregon, and 98 miles (158 km) south of Seattle. 
> Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat Alleyne FitzHerbert, 
> 1st Baron St Helens, 
> a friend of explorer George Vancouver who surveyed the area in the late 18th century. The volcano is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire.
>
> The Mount St. Helens major eruption of May 18, 1980 
> is the most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history. 
> 
> Fifty-seven people were killed and 200 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24 km) of railways, 
> and 185 miles (298 km) of highway were destroyed. 
> 
> A massive debris avalanche, triggered by a magnitude 5.1 earthquake, 
> caused a lateral eruption that reduced the elevation of the mountain's summit 
> from 9,677 to 8,363 ft (2,950 to 2,549 m), leaving a 1 mile (1.6 km) wide horseshoe-shaped crater. The debris avalanche was 0.6 cubic miles (2.5 km3) in volume. 
> 
> The 1980 eruption disrupted terrestrial ecosystems near the volcano. 
> By contrast, aquatic ecosystems in the area greatly benefited from the amounts of ash, 
> allowing life to multiply rapidly. 
> Six years after the eruption, most lakes in the area had returned to their normal state.
>
> After its 1980 eruption, the volcano experienced continuous volcanic activity until 2008. 
> Geologists predict that future eruptions will be more destructive, 
> as the configuration of the lava domes requires more pressure to erupt. 
> 
> However, Mount St. Helens is a popular hiking spot and it is climbed year-round. 
> In 1982, the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was established by Congress.
