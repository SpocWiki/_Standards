## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Sojourner Truth (born Isabella Bomefree; c. 1797 – November 26, 1883) 
> was an American abolitionist and activist for African-American civil rights, 
> women's rights, and alcohol temperance. 
> 
> Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, New York, 
> but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. 
> After going to court to recover her son in 1828, 
> she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man.
>
> She gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 
> after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city 
> and go into the countryside "testifying to the hope that was in her." 
> 
> Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, 
> at the Ohio Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. 
> 
> The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title "Ain't I a Woman?", 
> a variation of the original speech that was published in 1863 
> as being spoken in a stereotypical Black dialect, then more commonly spoken in the South. 
> Sojourner Truth, however, grew up speaking Dutch as her first language.
>
> During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit Black men into the Union army; 
> after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government 
> for formerly enslaved people (summarized as the promise of "forty acres and a mule"). 
> 
> She continued to fight on behalf of women and African Americans until her death. 
> As her biographer Nell Irvin Painter wrote, 
> "At a time when most Americans thought of slaves as male and women as white, 
> Truth embodied a fact that still bears repeating: 
> Among the blacks are women; among the women, there are blacks."
>
> A memorial bust of Truth was unveiled in 2009 in Emancipation Hall 
> in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. 
> She is the first African American woman to have a statue in the Capitol building. 
> In 2014, Truth was included in Smithsonian magazine's list of 
> the "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time".
