> The **Underground Railroad** was used by freedom seekers from slavery in the United States 
> and was generally an organized network of secret routes and safe houses. 
> 
> Enslaved Africans and African Americans escaped from slavery as early as the 16th century 
> and many of their escapes were unaided, 
> but the network of safe houses operated by agents generally known as the Underground Railroad 
> began to organize in the 1780s among Abolitionist Societies in the North. 
> 
> It ran north and grew steadily 
> until the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln.  
> The escapees sought primarily to escape into free states, and from there to Canada.
>
> The network, primarily the work of free and enslaved African Americans, 
> was assisted by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. 
> 
> The enslaved people who risked capture and those who aided them 
> are also collectively referred to as the passengers and conductors of the Railroad, respectively. 
> 
> Various other routes led to Mexico, where slavery had been abolished, 
> and to islands in the Caribbean that were not part of the slave trade. 
> 
> An earlier escape route running south toward Florida, then a Spanish possession (except 1763–1783), 
> existed from the late 17th century until approximately 1790. 
> 
> During the American Civil War, freedom seekers escaped to Union lines in the South to obtain their freedom. 
> One estimate suggests that, by 1850, approximately 100,000 slaves had escaped to freedom via the network. 
> According to former professor of Pan-African studies, J. Blaine Hudson, 
> who was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Louisville, 
> by the end of the American Civil War 500,000 or more African Americans 
> self-emancipated themselves from slavery on the Underground Railroad.
