> The Louisiana Purchase (French: Vente de la Louisiane, lit. 'Sale of Louisiana') 
> was the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States 
> from the French First Republic in 1803. 
> 
> This consisted of most of the land in the Mississippi River's drainage basin west of the river. 
> In return for fifteen million dollars, or approximately eighteen dollars per square mile, 
> the United States nominally acquired a total of 828,000 sq mi (2,140,000 km2; 530,000,000 acres) in Middle America. 
> 
> However, France only controlled a small fraction of this area, 
> most of which was inhabited by Native Americans; effectively, for the majority of the area, 
> the United States bought the preemptive right to obtain Indian lands by treaty or by conquest, 
> to the exclusion of other colonial powers.
>
> The Kingdom of France had controlled the Louisiana territory from 1682 until it was ceded to Spain in 1762. 
> In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic, 
> regained ownership of Louisiana in exchange for territories in Tuscany 
> as part of a broader effort to re-establish a French colonial empire in North America. 
> 
> However, France's failure to suppress a revolt in Saint-Domingue, 
> coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the [[../../../_Standards/Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~North/UK|United Kingdom]], 
> prompted Napoleon to consider selling Louisiana to the United States. 
> 
> Acquisition of Louisiana was a long-term goal of President [[../../../_Standards/Earth/Continent/America~North/US~President/Jefferson,Thomas|Thomas Jefferson]], 
> who was especially eager to gain control of the crucial Mississippi River port of New Orleans. 
> Jefferson tasked James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston with purchasing New Orleans. 
> Negotiating with French Treasury Minister François Barbé-Marbois, 
> the U.S. representatives quickly agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana after it was offered. 
> Overcoming the opposition of the Federalist Party, 
> Jefferson and Secretary of State [[../../../_Standards/Earth/Continent/America~North/US~President/Madison,James|James Madison]] persuaded Congress 
> to ratify and fund the Louisiana Purchase.
>
> The Louisiana Purchase extended United States sovereignty across the Mississippi River, 
> nearly doubling the nominal size of the country. 
> The purchase included land from fifteen present U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, 
> including the entirety of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska; 
> large portions of North Dakota and South Dakota; the area of Montana, Wyoming, 
> and Colorado east of the Continental Divide; the portion of Minnesota west of the Mississippi River; 
> the northeastern section of New Mexico; northern portions of Texas; 
> New Orleans and the portions of the present state of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River; 
> and small portions of land within Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
> 
> At the time of the purchase, the territory of Louisiana's 
> non-native population was around 60,000 inhabitants, of whom half were enslaved Africans. 
> The western borders of the purchase were later settled by the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty with [[../../../_Standards/Earth/Continent/Europe/Europe~South/Spain|Spain]], 
> while the northern borders of the purchase were adjusted by the Treaty of 1818 with the British.
