> Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) 
> was the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974. 
> 
> A member of the Republican Party, he previously served 
> as a representative and senator from California and 
> as the 36th vice president from 1953 to 1961 under President [[Eisenhower,Dwight_D]]. 
> 
> His presidency saw the reduction of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, 
> détente with the Soviet Union and China, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, 
> and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and 
> Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
> Nixon's second term ended early when he became the only U.S. president 
> to resign from office, as a result of the[[../../../../../Knowledge/History.internal/Conspiracy-Theories/Watergate-Scandal]]]. 
>
> Nixon was born into a poor family of Quakers in a small town in Southern California. 
> He graduated from Duke Law School in 1937, practiced law in California, 
> and then moved with his wife Pat to Washington, D.C., in 1942 
> to work for the federal government. 
> 
> After serving active duty in the Naval Reserve during World War II, 
> he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946. 
> 
> His work on the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, 
> which elevated him to national prominence. In 1950, he was elected to the Senate. 
> Nixon was the running mate of Eisenhower, 
> the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1952 election, 
> and served for eight years as vice president. 
> 
> He narrowly lost the 1960 presidential election 
> to the Democratic Party nominee John F. Kennedy; 
> after his loss in the 1962 race for governor of California, 
> he announced his retirement from political life. 
> However, in 1968, he made another run for the presidency 
> and defeated the Democratic incumbent vice president Hubert Humphrey.
>
> Nixon ended American involvement in Vietnam combat in 1973 
> and the military draft in the same year. 
> 
> His visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, 
> and he also then concluded the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union. 
> 
> Domestically, Nixon pushed for the Controlled Substances Act and began the war on drugs. 
> Nixon's first term took place at the height of the American environmental movement 
> and enacted many progressive environmental policy shifts; 
> his administration created the Environmental Protection Agency 
> and passed legislation such as the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Air Acts. 
> 
> He implemented the ratified Twenty-sixth Amendment, 
> which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, 
> and enforced the desegregation of Southern schools. 
> 
> Under Nixon, relations with Native Americans improved, 
> seeing an increase in self-determination for Native Americans and 
> his administration rescinded the termination policy. 
> 
> Nixon imposed wage and price controls for 90 days, began the war on cancer, 
> and presided over the Apollo 11 Moon landing, which signaled the end of the Space Race. 
> He was re-elected in 1972, when he defeated Democratic candidate George McGovern 
> in one of the largest landslide victories in American history.
>
> In his second term, Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses in the Yom Kippur War, 
> a conflict which led to the oil crisis at home. 
> From 1973, ongoing revelations from the Nixon administration's involvement in Watergate 
> eroded his support in Congress and the country. 
> 
> The scandal began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee office, 
> ordered by administration officials, and escalated 
> despite cover-up efforts by the Nixon administration, of which he was aware. 
> 
> On August 9, 1974, facing almost certain impeachment and removal from office, 
> Nixon resigned. Afterward, he was issued a controversial pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. 
> 
> During nearly 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote ten books 
> and undertook many foreign trips, rehabilitating his image into that of an elder statesman 
> and leading expert on foreign affairs. 
> 
> On April 18, 1994, he suffered a debilitating stroke, and died four days later. 
> Evaluations of his presidency have proven complex, with some contemporaries 
> often regarding Nixon in the bottom tier of American presidents; 
> others have proven less severe, 
> contrasting his presidency's domestic and foreign policy successes 
> with the acrimonious circumstances of his departure.
