## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Willis Tower, formerly and still commonly referred to as the Sears Tower, 
> is a 110-story, 1,451-foot (442.3 m) skyscraper 
> in the Loop community area of Chicago in Illinois, United States. 
> 
> Designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan 
> of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), 
> it opened in 1973 as the world's tallest building, 
> a title that it held for nearly 25 years until 1998. 
> 
> It is the third-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, 
> as well as the 23rd-tallest in the world. 
> Each year, more than 1.7 million people visit the Skydeck, 
> the highest observation deck in the United States, 
> making it one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations. 
> 
> Due to its height and location, the tower is visible from a great distance. 
> The building has appeared in numerous films and television shows set in Chicago.
>
> The building occupies a site bound by 
> Franklin Street, Jackson Boulevard, Wacker Drive, and Adams Street. 
> 
> Graham and Khan designed the building as nine square "tubes", 
> clustered in a 3×3 matrix; seven of the tubes set back at upper floors. 
> 
> The tower has 108 stories as counted by standard methods, 
> though the building's owners count the main roof as 109 
> and the mechanical penthouse roof as 110. 
> 
> The facade is made of anodized aluminum and black glass. 
> The base of the building contains a retail complex known as the Catalog. 
> The lower half of the tower was originally occupied by retail company Sears, 
> which had its headquarters there until 1994, while the upper stories were rented out.
>
> The structure was known as the **Sears Tower** from its construction 
> until the naming rights were included in a 2009 lease with the Willis Group. 
> 
> Local area residents still refer to the building by its old name. 
> As of April 2018, the building's largest tenant is United Airlines, 
> which occupies around 20 floors. 
> 
> Other major tenants include the building's namesake Willis Towers Watson, 
> and law firms ArentFox Schiff and Seyfarth Shaw. 
> 
> Morgan Stanley became the building's fourth-largest tenant in 2017.
