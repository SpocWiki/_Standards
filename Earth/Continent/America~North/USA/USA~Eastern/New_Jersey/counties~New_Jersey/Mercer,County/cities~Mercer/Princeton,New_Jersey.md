> The Municipality of Princeton is a borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. 
> It was established on January 1, 2013, through the consolidation of the Borough of Princeton 
> and Princeton Township, both of which are now defunct. 
> 
> As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 30,681, 
> an increase of 2,109 (+7.4%) from the 2010 census combined count of 28,572. 
> In the 2000 census, the two communities had a total population of 30,230, 
> with 14,204 residents in the borough and 16,027 in the township.
>
> Princeton was founded before the American Revolutionary War. 
> 
> The borough is the home of Princeton University, 
> one of the world's most acclaimed research universities, 
> which bears its name and moved to the community in 1756 
> from the educational institution's previous location in Newark. Although its association with the university is primarily what makes Princeton a college town, other important institutions in the area include the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton Theological Seminary, Opinion Research Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens Corporate Research, SRI International, FMC Corporation, Educational Testing Service, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, Berlitz International, and Dow Jones & Company.
>
> Princeton is roughly equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia. 
> It is close to many major highways that serve both cities (e.g., Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1), 
> and receives major television and radio broadcasts from each. 
> It is also close to Trenton, New Jersey's capital city, New Brunswick and Edison.
>
> The New Jersey governor's official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, 
> when Morven (in what was then Princeton Borough) became the first governor's mansion. 
> In 1982, it was replaced by the larger Drumthwacket, 
> a colonial mansion located in the former township, but not all have actually lived in these houses. 
> Morven became a museum and garden, owned and operated by the New Jersey Historical Society.
>
> Throughout much of its history, the community was split into two separate municipalities: 
> a township and a borough. 
> 
> The central borough was completely surrounded by the township. 
> The borough seceded from the township in 1894 in a dispute over school taxes; 
> the two municipalities later formed Princeton Public Schools, 
> and some other public services were conducted together 
> before they were reunited into a single Princeton in January 2013. 
> 
> Princeton Borough contained Nassau Street, the main commercial street, 
> most of the university campus, and incorporated most of the urban area 
> until the postwar suburbanization. 
> 
> The borough and township had roughly equal populations. 
> 
> Other major streets include Harrison, Witherspoon, Nassau, Bayard, Washington, and Stockton.
