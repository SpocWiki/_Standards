> The Chrysler Building is a 1,046-foot-tall (319 m), Art Deco skyscraper 
> in the East Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, United States. 
> 
> Located at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue, 
> it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. 
> It was both the world's first supertall skyscraper 
> and the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. 
> As of 2019, the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.
>
> Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, 
> the building was commissioned by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. 
> The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, 
> was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street 
> and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. 
> 
> The Chrysler Building was designed and funded by Walter Chrysler personally 
> as a real estate investment for his children, 
> but it was not intended as the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters 
> (which was located in Detroit at the Highland Park Chrysler Plant from 1934 to 1996). 
> An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, 
> with numerous subsequent owners.
>
> When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, some calling it inane and unoriginal, others hailing it as modernist and iconic. Reviewers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries regarded the building as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the American Institute of Architects' list of America's Favorite Architecture. The facade and interior became New York City designated landmarks in 1978, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.
