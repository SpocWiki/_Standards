> **Paleo-Indians** (also spelled Paleoindians) were the first peoples who entered 
> and subsequently inhabited the Americas towards the end of the Late Pleistocene period. 
> 
> The word comes from the prefix paleo- comes from 
> the Ancient Greek adjective: παλαιός, romanized: palaiós, lit. 'old; ancient', 
> and "Indian", which has been historically used to refer to Indigenous peoples of the Americas. 
> The term Paleo-Indian applies specifically to the lithic period in the Western Hemisphere 
> and is distinct from the term Paleolithic.
>
> Traditional theories suggest that big-animal hunters crossed the Bering Strait 
> from North Asia into the Americas over a land bridge (Beringia). 
> This bridge existed from 45,000 to 12,000 BCE (47,000–14,000 BP). 
> 
> Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores 
> far into Alaska. 
> 
> From c. 16,500 – c. 13,500 BCE (c. 18,500 – c. 15,500 BP), 
> ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America. 
> This allowed land animals, followed by humans, 
> to migrate south into the interior of the continent. 
> 
> The people went on foot or used boats along the coastline. 
> 
> The dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas remain subjects of ongoing debate. 
> There were likely three waves of ancient settlers from the Bering Sea to the American continent.
>
> Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, 
> are the primary evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. 
> 
> Archeologists and anthropologists 
> use surviving crafted lithic flaked tools to classify cultural periods. 
> 
> Scientific evidence links Indigenous Americans to eastern Siberian populations 
> by the distribution of blood types, and genetic composition 
> as indicated by molecular data, such as DNA. 
> There is evidence for at least two separate migrations.
>
> Paleoindians lived alongside and hunted many now extinct megafauna (large animals), 
> with most large animals across the Americas becoming extinct 
> towards the end of the Paleoindian period as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions. 
> 
> The potential role of human hunting in the extinctions 
> has been the subject of much controversy. 
> 
> From 8000 to 7000 BCE (10,000–9,000 BP) the climate stabilized, 
> leading to a rise in population and lithic technology advances, 
> resulting in a more sedentary lifestyle during the following Archaic Period.
