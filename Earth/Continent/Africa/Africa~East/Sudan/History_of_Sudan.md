## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The history of Sudan refers to the territory that today makes up Republic of the Sudan 
> and the state of South Sudan, which became independent in 2011. 
> 
> The territory of Sudan is geographically part of a larger African region, also known as "Sudan". 
> The term is derived from Arabic: بلاد السودان bilād as-sūdān, or "land of the black people", 
> and has sometimes been used more widely referring to the Sahel belt of West and Central Africa.
>
> The modern Republic of the Sudan was formed in early 1956 
> and inherited its boundaries from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, established in 1899. 
> 
> For times predating 1899, usage of the term "Sudan" mainly applied to the Turkish Sudan and the Mahdist State, 
> and a wider and changing territory between Egypt in the North 
> and regions in the South adjacent to modern Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia.
>
> The early history of the Kingdom of Kush, located along the Nile region in northern Sudan, 
> is intertwined with the history of ancient Egypt, with which it was politically allied over several regnal eras. 
> 
> By virtue of its proximity to Egypt, Sudan participated in the wider history of the Near East, 
> with the important 25th dynasty of Egypt 
> 
> and the Christianization of the three Nubian kingdoms Nobatia, Makuria, and Alodia in the sixth century. 
> As a result of Christianization, the Old Nubian language stands as the oldest recorded Nilo-Saharan language 
> (earliest records dating to the eighth century in an adaptation of the Coptic alphabet).
>
> While Islam was already present on the Sudanese Red Sea coast and the adjacent territories since the 7th century, 
> the Nile Valley did not undergo Islamization until the 14th-15th century, 
> following the decline of the Christian kingdoms. 
> 
> These kingdoms were succeeded by the Sultanate of Sennar in the early 16th century, 
> which controlled large parts of the Nile Valley and the Eastern Desert, 
> while the kingdoms of Darfur controlled the western part of Sudan. 
> 
> Two small kingdoms arose in the southern regions, the Shilluk Kingdom of 1490, 
> and Taqali of 1750, near modern-day South Sudan, 
> but both northern and southern regions were seized by Muhammad Ali of Egypt during the 1820s. 
> 
> The oppressive rule of Muhammad Ali and his immediate successors is credited for 
> stirring up resentment against the Turco-Egyptian and British rulers 
> and led to the establishment of the Mahdist State, founded by Muhammad Ahmad in 1881.
>
> Since independence in 1956, the history of Sudan has been tarnished by internal conflict, 
> including the First Sudanese Civil War (1955–1972), the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005), the War in Darfur (2003–2020)–culminating in the secession of South Sudan on 9 July 2011, 
> after which the South Sudanese Civil War took place therein (2013–2020)– 
> and the current Sudanese civil war (2023–present).
