> The Economic Community of West African States 
> (ECOWAS; also known as CEDEAO in French and Portuguese) 
> is a regional political and economic union of twelve countries of West Africa. 
> Collectively, the present and former members comprise an area of 5,114,162 km2 (1,974,589 sq mi) 
> and have an estimated population of over 424.34 million.
>
> Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African Economic Community (AEC), 
> the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve "collective self-sufficiency" for its member states 
> by creating a single large trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union. 
> 
> Additionally, ECOWAS aims to raise living standards and promote economic development. 
> The union was established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of Lagos, 
> with its stated mission to promote economic integration across the region. 
> A revised version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993 in Cotonou, the largest city in Benin.
>
> ECOWAS's published principles include equality and inter-dependence of member states, 
> solidarity, self-reliance, cooperation and harmonization of policies, nonaggression, 
> promotion of human rights, economic and social justice, and democratic governance.
>
> Notably among ECOWAS's protocols and plans are 
> the ECOWAS Free Movement of Persons, Residences and Establishment Protocol 
> and the Ecotour Action Plan 2019–2029. 
> 
> The Free Movement of Persons Protocol permits citizens 
> the right to enter and reside in any member state's territory, 
> and the Ecotour Action Plan aims to develop and integrate the tourist industry of each member state.
>
> ECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, 
> with member states occasionally sending joint military forces 
> to intervene in the bloc's member countries at times of political instability and unrest.
>
> In 2024, the military governments of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali 
> jointly announced their withdrawal from the bloc, 
> after having been suspended following respective military takeovers in these countries. 
> 
> The withdrawal took effect on 29 January 2025. 
> The three later went on to form the Alliance of Sahel States, with the end goal of establishing a federation.
