> The Hindu Kush is an 800-kilometre-long (500 mi) mountain range 
> in Central and South Asia to the west of the [[Earth/Continent/Asia/Asia~Central/Himalayas|Himalayas]]. 
> 
> It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan 
> and far southeastern Tajikistan. 
> 
> The range forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH); 
> to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains 
> near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, 
> after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border. 
>
> The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range. 
> Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River. 
> It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) 
> to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. 
> The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, 
> with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at 7,708 metres (25,289 ft) 
> in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
>
> The Hindu Kush range region was a historically significant center of Buddhism, 
> with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas. 
> The range and communities settled in it hosted ancient monasteries, 
> important trade networks and travelers between Central Asia and South Asia. 
> 
> While the vast majority of the region has been majority-Muslim for several centuries now, 
> certain portions of the Hindu Kush only became Islamized relatively recently, 
> such as Kafiristan, which retained ancient polytheistic beliefs until the 19th century 
> when it was converted to Islam by the Emirate of Afghanistan 
> and renamed Nuristan ("land of light"). 
> 
> The Hindu Kush range has also been the passageway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent, 
> and continues to be important to contemporary warfare in Afghanistan.
