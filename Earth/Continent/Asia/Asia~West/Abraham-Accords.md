## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Abraham Accords** are a set of agreements that established diplomatic normalization 
> between Israel and several Arab states, beginning with [[United_Arab_Emirates|the United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]]. 
> 
> Announced in August and September 2020 
> and signed in Washington,D.C. on September 15, 2020, 
> the accords were mediated by the United States under President [[../../../../../_public/geo/Continent/America~North/US~President/Trump,Donald|Donald Trump]]. 
> 
> The UAE and [[Bahrain]] became the first Arab countries to formally recognize Israel since [[Jordan]] in 1994. 
> In the months that followed, Sudan and [[../../Africa/Africa~North/Morocco|Morocco]] also agreed to normalize relations with Israel, 
> although Sudan's agreement remains unratified as of 2024.
>
> The accords emerged against the backdrop of 
> growing unofficial cooperation between Israel and Sunni Arab states throughout the 2010s, 
> driven by shared concerns about Iran. 
> 
> Efforts to build ties had become increasingly public by 2018, with visits by Israeli officials to Gulf states 
> and the start of limited military and intelligence cooperation. 
> 
> In mid-2020, a normalization deal between Israel and the UAE was brokered 
> in exchange for the suspension of Israeli plans to annex parts of the West Bank, as proposed in the Trump peace plan.
>
> The agreements formalized economic, diplomatic, and security cooperation. 
> In [[../../Africa/Africa~North/Morocco|Morocco]]'s case, normalization came with U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over [[../../Africa/Africa~West/Western_Sahara|Western Sahara]]. 
> For Sudan, it included removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism 
> and access to international financial support. 
> 
> The accords were presented in elaborate ceremonies 
> and widely promoted by the Trump administration as a major diplomatic achievement.
>
> Reactions in the Arab world were mixed. 
> While governments expressed support, public opinion in many countries remained opposed, 
> particularly due to the accords' lack of progress on resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. 
> 
> Despite this, the accords led to new initiatives in trade, defense, energy, technology, and cultural exchange. 
> The name "Abraham Accords" was chosen 
> to reflect the shared heritage of the Abrahamic religions—Judaism and Islam.
