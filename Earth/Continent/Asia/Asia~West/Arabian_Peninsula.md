> The Arabian Peninsula (Arabic: شبه الجزيرة العربية, Shibhu al-jazīra al-ʿarabiyya, or جزيرة العرب, Jazīrat al-ʿarab, lit. 'Island of the Arabs'), or Arabia, is a peninsula in West Asia, situated north-east of Africa on the Arabian plate. At 3,237,500 km2 (1.25 million sq mi), comparable in size to India, the Arabian Peninsula is the largest peninsula in the world.
>
> Geographically, the Arabian Peninsula comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen, as well as southern Iraq and Jordan. The largest of these is Saudi Arabia. In the Roman era, the Sinai Peninsula was also considered a part of Arabia.
>
> The Arabian Peninsula formed as a result of the rifting of the Red Sea between 56 and 23 million years ago, and is bordered by the Red Sea to the west and south-west, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the north-east, the Levant and Mesopotamia to the north and the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean to the south-east. The peninsula plays a critical geopolitical role in the Arab world and globally due to its vast reserves of oil and natural gas.
>
> The era of human settlement in the Arabian Peninsula predating any systematic written records is known as Prehistoric Arabia. The period of Arabian history beginning with the appearance of systematic records, until the rise of Islam, is known as Pre-Islamic Arabia. In the medieval Islamic period, geographers divided the Peninsula into four main regions: the Central Plateau (Najd and Al-Yamama), South Arabia (Yemen, Hadhramaut and south-western Oman), Al-Bahrain (Eastern Arabia or Al-Hassa), and the Hejaz (Tihamah for the western coast).
