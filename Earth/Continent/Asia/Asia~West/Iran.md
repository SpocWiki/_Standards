> **Iran**, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI), 
> also known as Persia, is a country in West Asia. 
> It borders Turkey to the northwest and Iraq to the west, Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
> the Caspian Sea, and Turkmenistan to the north, Afghanistan to the east, 
> Pakistan to the southeast, the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf to the south. 
> 
> With a mostly Persian-ethnic population of almost 90 million in an area of 1,648,195 km2, 
> Iran ranks 17th globally in both geographic size and population. 
> It is the sixth-largest country entirely in Asia 
> and one of the world's most mountainous countries. 
> 
> Officially an Islamic republic, Iran has a Muslim-majority population. 
> The country is divided into five regions with 31 provinces. 
> Tehran is the nation's capital, largest city and financial center.
>
> A cradle of civilization, Iran has been inhabited since the Lower Palaeolithic. 
> It was first unified as a state by Deioces in the seventh century BC, 
> and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, 
> when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire, 
> one of the largest in ancient history. 
> 
> Alexander the Great conquered the empire in the fourth century BC. 
> An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC 
> and liberated the country, 
> which was succeeded by the Sasanian Empire in the third century AD. 
> 
> Ancient Iran saw some of the earliest developments of writing, 
> agriculture, urbanization, religion and central government. 
> 
> Muslims conquered the region in the seventh century AD, leading to Iran's Islamization. 
> The blossoming literature, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy 
> and art became major elements for Iranian civilization during the Islamic Golden Age. 
> A series of Iranian Muslim dynasties ended Arab rule, revived the Persian language and 
> ruled the country until the Seljuk and Mongol conquests of the 11th to 14th centuries.
>
> In the 16th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state 
> with Twelver Shi'ism as the official religion. 
> During the Afsharid Empire in the 18th century, Iran was a leading world power, 
> though by the 19th century, it had lost significant territory 
> through conflicts with the Russian Empire. 
> 
> The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution 
> and the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty. 
> Attempts by [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] to nationalize the oil industry 
> led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953. 
> After the Iranian Revolution, the monarchy was overthrown in 1979 
> and the Islamic Republic of Iran was established by Ruhollah Khomeini, 
> who became the country's first Supreme Leader. 
> In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, sparking the eight-year-long Iran–Iraq War, 
> which ended in stalemate.
>
> Iran is officially governed as a unitary Islamic Republic with a Presidential system, 
> with ultimate authority vested in a Supreme Leader. 
> The government is authoritarian and has attracted widespread 
> criticism for its significant violations of human rights and civil liberties. 
> 
> Iran is a major regional power, due to its large reserves of fossil fuels, 
> including the world's second largest natural gas supply, 
> third largest proven oil reserves, its geopolitically significant location, 
> military capabilities, cultural hegemony, regional influence, 
> and role as the world's focal point of Shia Islam. 
> 
> The Iranian economy is the world's 19th-largest by PPP. 
> Iran is an active and founding member of the United Nations, 
> OIC, OPEC, ECO, NAM, SCO and BRICS. 
> Iran is home to 28 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the 10th highest in the world, 
> and ranks 5th in Intangible Cultural Heritage, or human treasures.
