> The Alpide belt or Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, or more recently and rarely the Tethyan orogenic belt, 
> is a seismic and orogenic belt that includes an array of mountain ranges 
> extending for more than 15,000 kilometres (9,300 mi) along the southern margin of Eurasia, 
> stretching from Java and Sumatra, through the Indochinese Peninsula, the Himalayas and Transhimalayas, 
> the mountains of Iran, Caucasus, Anatolia, the Mediterranean, and out into the Atlantic.
>
> It includes, from west to east, the major ranges of the 
> - Atlas Mountains, 
> - the Alps, 
> - the Caucasus Mountains, 
> - Alborz, 
> - Hindu Kush, 
> - Karakoram, and 
> - the Himalayas. 
> It is the second most seismically active region in the world, after the circum-Pacific belt (the Ring of Fire), 
> with 17% of the world's largest earthquakes.
>
> The belt is the result of Mesozoic-to-Cenozoic-to-recent closure of the Tethys Ocean 
> and process of collision between the northward-moving African, Arabian, and Indian plates with the Eurasian plate. 
> 
> Each collision results in a convergent boundary, a topic covered in plate tectonics. 
> The approximate alignment of so many convergent boundaries trending east to west, 
> first noticed by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess, 
> suggests that once many plates were one plate, 
> and the collision formed one subduction zone, which was oceanic, subducting the floor of Tethys.
>
> Suess called the single continent Gondwana, after some rock formations in India, 
> then part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which had earlier divided from another supercontinent, Laurasia, 
> and was now pushing its way back. 
> 
> Eurasia descends from Laurasia, the Laurentia part having split away to the west 
> as a consequence of the formation of the North Atlantic Ocean. 
> As Tethys closed, Gondwana pushed up mountain ranges on the southern margin of Eurasia.
