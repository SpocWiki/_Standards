> The Salween is a Southeast Asian river, about 3,289 km (2,044 mi) long, 
> flowing from the Tibetan Plateau south into the Andaman Sea. 
> 
> The Salween flows primarily within southwest China and eastern Myanmar, 
> with a short section forming the border of Myanmar and Thailand. 
> 
> Throughout most of its course, it runs swiftly through rugged mountain canyons. 
> 
> Despite the river's great length, only the last 90 km (56 mi) are navigable, 
> where it forms a modest estuary and delta at Mawlamyine. 
> 
> The river is known by various names along its course, including the 
> - Thanlwin in Myanmar (named after Elaeocarpus sp., an olive-like plant that grows on its banks)  and the 
> - Nu Jiang in China (or Nu River, named after Nu people). 
> The commonly used spelling "Salween" is an anglicisation of the Burmese name 
> dating from 19th-century British maps.
>
> Due to its great range of elevation and latitude coupled with geographic isolation, 
> the Salween basin is considered one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the world, 
> containing an estimated 25 percent of the world's terrestrial animal species 
> and thousands of plant species. 
> 
> Along its course the Salween provides water for agriculture 
> and supports abundant fisheries, especially in the delta region. 
> 
> The Salween basin is home to numerous ethnic minority groups, 
> whose ancestors largely originated in the Tibetan Plateau and northwest China. 
> Starting about 5,000 years ago, people began migrating south along the river, 
> establishing small kingdoms and city-states.
>
> During the last 1,000 years, the Salween has defined various frontiers 
> of the Burmese empires to the west, the Kingdom of Siam to the south, 
> and Imperial China to the east, 
> with the Shan States along the middle Salween being a frequently contested area. 
> 
> In the 19th century, the British Empire invaded Burma 
> with Mawlamyine serving as the colonial capital for many decades. 
> 
> Since Burmese independence in 1948, the Salween basin has been a battleground 
> for several fronts of the Myanmar civil war, with large areas in Shan State and Karen State 
> (Kayin State) contested between the Myanmar military and local ethnic militias.
>
> The Salween is one of the least fragmented large river systems in Asia, 
> with only a few small dams in the headwaters of the river and on tributaries. 
> 
> The river has extremely high hydropower potential, 
> with a fall of more than 5,000 m (16,000 ft) from its source. 
> 
> Since the 1970s, the Myanmar and Thai governments 
> have sought to build massive hydroelectric dams along the river. 
> 
> China also planned to dam the upper Salween, 
> but in 2016 these plans were dropped in favor of establishing a national park. 
> The future of dam projects in Myanmar and Thailand remains uncertain.
