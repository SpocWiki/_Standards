> The Gobi Desert (Mongolian: Говь, ᠭᠣᠪᠢ, ; Chinese: 戈壁; pinyin: gēbì) 
> is a large, cold desert and grassland region in southern Mongolia and North China. 
> It is the sixth-largest desert in the world. 
>
> The name of the desert comes from the Mongolian word gobi, 
> used to refer to all of the waterless regions in the Mongolian Plateau; 
> in Chinese, gobi is used to refer to rocky, semi-deserts such as the Gobi itself 
> rather than sandy deserts.
