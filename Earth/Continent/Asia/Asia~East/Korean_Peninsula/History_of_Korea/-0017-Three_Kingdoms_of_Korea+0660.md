> The Three Kingdoms of Korea or Samhan (Goguryeo, Paekche and Silla) 
> competed for hegemony over the Korean Peninsula 
> during the ancient period of Korean history. 
> 
> During the Three Kingdoms period (Korean: 삼국 시대), 
> many states and statelets consolidated until, 
> after Buyeo was annexed in 494 and Gaya was annexed in 562, 
> only three remained on the Korean Peninsula: Goguryeo, Paekche and Silla. 
> 
> The "Korean Three Kingdoms" contributed to what would become Korea; 
> and the Goguryeo, Paekche and Silla peoples became the Korean people.
>
> The three kingdoms occupied the entire peninsula and roughly half of Manchuria 
> (modern-day Northeast China and small parts of the Russian Far East). 
> Goguryeo controlled the northern half of the peninsula, 
> as well as Liaodong Peninsula and Manchuria. 
> Paekche and Silla occupied the southern half of the peninsula. 
> The island kingdoms of Tamna and Usan were subordinated to Paekche and Silla, respectively.
>
> All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. 
> Paekche and Goguryeo shared founding myths which likely originated in Buyeo. 
> Buddhism, which arrived in Korea in the 3rd century AD from India via Tibet and China, 
> became the state religion of all constituents of the three kingdoms, 
> starting with Goguryeo in 372 AD. 
> 
> The Three Kingdoms of Korea all had a warrior aristocracy 
> in contrast to the literary elite of China.
>
> The period ended in the 7th century, after Silla allied with Tang China and unified the peninsula for the first time in history. After the fall of Paekche and Goguryeo, the Tang dynasty established a short-lived military government to administer parts of the Korean Peninsula. Silla was joined by Goguryeo and Paekche loyalists and fought the Tang for hegemony over the Korean Peninsula. Silla was eventually divided into the Later Three Kingdoms and ultimately annexed by the new Goguryeo revivalist state of Goryeo.
