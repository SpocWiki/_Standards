## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (**ussr**), commonly known as the Soviet Union, 
> was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. 
> 
> During its existence, it was the largest country by area, 
> extending across eleven time zones and sharing borders with twelve countries, 
> and the third-most populous country. 
> 
> An overall successor to the Russian Empire, it was nominally organized as a federal union of national republics, the largest and most populous of which was the Russian SFSR. In practice, its government and economy were highly centralized. As a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), it was a flagship communist state. Its capital and largest city was Moscow.
>
> The Soviet Union's roots lay in the October Revolution of 1917. 
> The new government, led by Vladimir Lenin, established the Russian SFSR, 
> the world's first constitutionally socialist state. 
> 
> The revolution was not accepted by all within the Russian Republic, resulting in the Russian Civil War. 
> The Russian SFSR and its subordinate republics were merged into the Soviet Union in 1922. 
> 
> Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power, 
> inaugurating rapid industrialization and forced collectivization that led to significant economic growth 
> but contributed to a famine between 1930 and 1933 that killed millions. 
> 
> The Soviet forced labour camp system of the Gulag was expanded. 
> During the late 1930s, Stalin's government conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents, 
> resulting in mass death, imprisonment, and deportation. 
> 
> In 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact, 
> but in 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the largest land invasion in history, 
> opening the Eastern Front of World War II. 
> 
> The Soviets played a decisive role in defeating the Axis powers, 
> suffering an estimated 27 million casualties, which accounted for most Allied losses. 
> 
> In the aftermath of the war, the Soviet Union consolidated the territory occupied by the Red Army, 
> forming satellite states, and undertook rapid economic development which cemented its status as a superpower.
>
> Geopolitical tensions with the United States led to the Cold War. 
> The American-led Western Bloc coalesced into NATO in 1949, 
> prompting the Soviet Union to form its own military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955. 
> 
> Neither side engaged in direct military confrontation, 
> and instead fought on an ideological basis and through proxy wars. 
> 
> In 1953, following Stalin's death, the Soviet Union undertook a campaign of de-Stalinization under Nikita Khrushchev, 
> which saw reversals and rejections of Stalinist policies. 
> This campaign caused tensions with Communist China. 
> 
> During the 1950s, the Soviet Union expanded its efforts in space exploration 
> and took a lead in the Space Race with 
> - the first artificial satellite, 
> - the first human spaceflight, 
> - the first space station, and 
> - the first probe to land on another planet. 
> 
> In 1985, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
> sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. 
> In 1989, various countries of the Warsaw Pact overthrew their Soviet-backed regimes, 
> and nationalist and separatist movements erupted across the Soviet Union. 
> 
> In 1991, amid efforts to preserve the country as a renewed federation, 
> an attempted coup against Gorbachev by hardline communists prompted the largest republics—
> Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus—to secede. 
> 
> On 26 December, Gorbachev officially recognized the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
> Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the Russian SFSR, oversaw its reconstitution into the Russian Federation, 
> which became the Soviet Union's successor state; 
> all other republics emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states.
>
> The Soviet Union produced many significant social and technological achievements and innovations. 
> It had the world's second-largest economy and largest standing military. 
> 
> An NPT-designated state, it wielded the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world. 
> As an Allied nation, it was a founding member of the United Nations 
> as well as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. 
> 
> Before its dissolution, the Soviet Union was one of the world's two superpowers 
> through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, 
> global diplomatic and ideological influence (particularly in the Global South), 
> military and economic strengths, and scientific accomplishments.
