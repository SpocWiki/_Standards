> The Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC or EurAsEC) was a regional organisation between 2000 and 2014 
> which aimed for the economic integration of its member states. 
> 
> The organisation originated from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on 29 March 1996, 
> with the treaty on the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community signed on 10 October 2000 
> in Kazakhstan's capital Astana by Presidents Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, 
> Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan, Vladimir Putin of Russia, 
> and Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan. 
> Uzbekistan joined the community on 7 October 2005, but later withdrew on 16 October 2008.
>
> During the 14 years, the EAEC implemented a number of economic policies to unify the community. 
> The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia was formed on 1 January 2010, 
> and later renamed the Eurasian Customs Union. 
> 
> The four freedoms of movement modelled after the European Union (goods, capital, services, and people) were fully implemented by 25 January 2012, with the formation of the Eurasian Economic Space.
>
> On 10 October 2014, an agreement on the termination of the Eurasian Economic Community was signed in Minsk after a session of the Interstate Council of the EAEC. The Eurasian Economic Community was terminated from 1 January 2015 in connection with the launch of the Eurasian Economic Union. While the Eurasian Economic Union effectively replaces the community, membership negotiations with Tajikistan are still ongoing. All other EAEC members have joined the new union.
