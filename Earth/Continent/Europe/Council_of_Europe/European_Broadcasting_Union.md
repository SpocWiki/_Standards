> The European Broadcasting Union (EBU; French: Union européenne de radio-télévision, UER) 
> is an alliance of public service media organisations 
> in countries within the European Broadcasting Area (EBA) 
> or who are members of the Council of Europe. 
> 
> As of 2024, it is made up of 123 member organisations from 56 countries, 
> and 31 associate members from a further 20 countries. 
> It was established in 1950, and has its administrative headquarters in Geneva.
>
> The EBU owns and operates the Eurovision and Euroradio telecommunications networks 
> on which major television and radio broadcasts are distributed live to its members. 
> 
> It also operates the daily Eurovision news exchange in which members share breaking news footage. 
> In 2017, the EBU launched the Eurovision Social Newswire, an eyewitness and video verification service. 
> Led by Head of Social Newsgathering, Derek Bowler, 
> the service provides members of the EBU with verified 
> and cleared-for-use newsworthy eyewitness media emerging on social media.
>
> The EBU, in co-operation with its members, produces programmes 
> and organises events in which its members can participate, 
> such as the Eurovision Song Contest, its best known production, 
> or the Eurovision Debates between candidates for president of the European Commission 
> for the 2014, 2019 and 2024 parliamentary elections. 
> 
> Noel Curran has been director-general since 2017.
