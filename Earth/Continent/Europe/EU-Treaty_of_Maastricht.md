> The Treaty on European Union, commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty, is the foundation treaty of the European Union (EU). 
> Concluded in 1992 between the then-twelve member states of the European Communities, 
> it announced "a new stage in the process of European integration" chiefly in provisions for a shared European citizenship, 
> for the eventual introduction of a single currency, and (with less precision) for common foreign and security policies, 
> and a number of changes to the European institutions and their decision taking procedures, 
> not least a strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament and more majority voting on the Council of Ministers. 
> 
> Although these were seen by many to presage a "federal Europe", key areas remained inter-governmental with national governments collectively taking key decisions. 
> This constitutional debate continued through the negotiation of subsequent treaties (see below), culminating in the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon. 
>
> In the wake of the Eurozone debt crisis unfolding from 2009, 
> the most enduring reference to the Maastricht Treaty has been to the rules of compliance – the "Maastricht criteria" – for the currency union.
>
> Against the background of the end of the Cold War and the re-unification of Germany, 
> and in anticipation of accelerated globalisation, 
> the treaty negotiated tensions between member states seeking deeper integration and those wishing to retain greater national control. 
> The resulting compromise faced what was to be the first in a series of EU treaty ratification crises.
