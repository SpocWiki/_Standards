> The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, shortened to EBRD 
> (French: Banque européenne pour la reconstruction et le développement or BERD), 
> is an international financial institution founded in 1991 in Paris. 
> As a multilateral developmental investment bank, 
> the EBRD uses investment as a tool to build market economies.
>
> Initially focused on the countries of the former Eastern Bloc 
> it expanded to support development in more than 30 countries from Central Europe to Central Asia. 
> 
> Similar to other multilateral development banks, the EBRD has members from all over the world 
> (North America, Africa, Asia and Australia, see below), 
> with the biggest single shareholder being the United States, 
> but only lends regionally in its countries of operations. 
> 
> Headquartered in London, the EBRD is owned by 77 countries and two European Union institutions, 
> the newest shareholder being Nigeria since February 2025. 
> Despite its public sector shareholders, 
> it invests in private enterprises, together with commercial partners.
>
> The EBRD is not to be confused with the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
> which is owned by EU member states and is used to support EU policy. 
> EBRD is also distinct from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB).
