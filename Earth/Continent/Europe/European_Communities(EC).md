> The European Communities (EC) were 3 international organizations 
> that were governed by the same set of institutions. These were 
> - the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), 
> - the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom), and 
> - the European Economic Community (EEC), 
> the last of which was renamed the European Community (EC) in 1993 
> by the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union. 
> 
> The European Union was established at that time more as a concept rather than an entity, 
> while the Communities remained the actual subjects of international law 
> impersonating the rather abstract Union, becoming at the same time its first pillar. 
> In popular language, however, 
> the singular European Community was sometimes used interchangeably with the plural phrase, 
> in the sense of referring to all three entities.
>
> The European Coal and Steel Community ceased to exist in 2002 when its founding treaty expired. 
> The European Community was merged with the second and third EU pillars 
> by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, 
> finally allowing the European Union to move beyond being only a concept 
> and to assume the shape of a legally incorporated international organization 
> with juridical personality, designated as the legal successor to the Community. 
> 
> However, the reformed EU has not become entirely unified, 
> because Euratom, though governed with the EU by the common set of institutions, 
> has been retained as an entity distinct from the EU, 
> along with a number of other international entities, such as 
> - the European Investment Bank, 
> - the European University Institute, 
> - the European Stability Mechanism, and 
> - the Unified Patent Court.
