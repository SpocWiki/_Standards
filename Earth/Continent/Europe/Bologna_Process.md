> The Bologna Process is a series of ministerial meetings and agreements between European countries 
> to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher-education qualifications. 
> 
> The process has created the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention. 
> It is named after the University of Bologna, 
> where the Bologna declaration was signed by education ministers from 29 European countries in 1999. 
> 
> The process was opened to other countries in the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, and government meetings have been held in Prague (2001), Berlin (2003), Bergen (2005), London (2007), Leuven (2009), Budapest-Vienna (2010), Bucharest (2012), Yerevan (2015), Paris (2018), and Rome (2020).
>
> Before the signing of the Bologna declaration, 
> the Magna Charta Universitatum was issued at a meeting of university rectors 
> celebrating the 900th anniversary of the University of Bologna (and European universities) in 1988. 
> 
> One year before the declaration, education ministers Claude Allègre (France), Jürgen Rüttgers (Germany), Luigi Berlinguer (Italy) and Baroness Blackstone (UK) signed the Sorbonne declaration in Paris in 1998, committing themselves to "harmonising the architecture of the European Higher Education system". 
> The Bologna Process has 49 participating countries.
