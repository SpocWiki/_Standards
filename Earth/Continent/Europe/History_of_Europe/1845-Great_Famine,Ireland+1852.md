> The Great Famine, also known as the Great Hunger (Irish: an Gorta Mór [ənˠ ˈɡɔɾˠt̪ˠə ˈmˠoːɾˠ]), 
> the Famine and the Irish Potato Famine, was a period of starvation and disease in Ireland 
> lasting from 1845 to 1852 that constituted a historical social crisis 
> and subsequently had a major impact on Irish society and history as a whole. 
> 
> The most severely affected areas were in the western and southern parts of Ireland—
> where the Irish language was dominant—
> and hence the period was contemporaneously known in Irish as an Drochshaol, 
> which literally translates to "the bad life" and loosely translates to "the hard times". 
> 
> The worst year of the famine was 1847, which became known as "Black '47". 
> The population of Ireland on the eve of the famine was about 8.5 million, by 1901 it was just 4.4 million. 
> During the Great Hunger, roughly 1 million people died and more than 1 million more fled the country, 
> causing the country's population to fall by 20–25% (in some towns, populations fell as much as 67%) 
> between 1841 and 1871. 
> Between 1845 and 1855, at least 2.1 million people left Ireland, 
> primarily on packet ships but also on steamboats and barques—
> one of the greatest exoduses from a single island in history.
>
> The proximate cause of the famine was the infection of potato crops by blight (Phytophthora infestans) 
> throughout Europe during the 1840s. Blight infection caused 100,000 deaths outside Ireland 
> and influenced much of the unrest that culminated in European Revolutions of 1848. 
> 
> Longer-term reasons for the massive impact of this particular famine 
> included the system of absentee landlordism and single-crop dependence. 
> 
> Initial limited but constructive government actions to alleviate famine distress 
> were ended by a new Whig administration in London, which pursued a laissez-faire economic doctrine, 
> but also because some in power believed in divine providence or that the Irish lacked moral character, 
> with aid only resuming to some degree later. 
> 
> Large amounts of food were exported from Ireland during the famine 
> and the refusal of London to bar such exports, as had been done on previous occasions, 
> was an immediate and continuing source of controversy, 
> contributing to anti-British sentiment and the campaign for independence. 
> 
> Additionally, the famine indirectly resulted in tens of thousands of households being evicted, 
> exacerbated by a provision forbidding access to workhouse aid 
> while in possession of more than one-quarter acre of land.
>
> The famine was a defining moment in the history of Ireland, 
> which was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1801 to 1922. 
> The famine and its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political, and cultural landscape, 
> producing an estimated 2 million refugees and spurring a century-long population decline. 
> 
> For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory. 
> The strained relations between many Irish people and the then ruling British government worsened further 
> because of the famine, heightening ethnic and sectarian tensions 
> and boosting nationalism and republicanism both in Ireland and among Irish emigrants around the world. 
> 
> English documentary maker John Percival said that 
> the famine "became part of the long story of betrayal and exploitation 
> which led to the growing movement in Ireland for independence." 
> Scholar Kirby Miller makes the same point. 
> Debate exists regarding nomenclature for the event, 
> whether to use the term "Famine", "Potato Famine" or "Great Hunger", 
> the last of which some believe most accurately captures the complicated history of the period.
>
> The potato blight returned to Europe in 1879 but, by this time, 
> the Land War (one of the largest agrarian movements to take place in 19th-century Europe) 
> had begun in Ireland. 
> 
> The movement, organized by the Land League, continued the political campaign for the Three Fs 
> which was issued in 1850 by the Tenant Right League during the Great Famine. 
> When the potato blight returned to Ireland in the 1879 famine, 
> the League boycotted "notorious landlords" and its members physically blocked the evictions of farmers; 
> the consequent reduction in homelessness and house demolition 
> resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of deaths.
