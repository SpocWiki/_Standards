> The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, 
> mainly known as the Knights Templar, was a  military order of the Catholic faith, 
> and one of the most important military orders in Western Christianity. 
> 
> They were founded in 1118 to defend pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, 
> with their headquarters located there on the Temple Mount, 
> and existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages.
>
> Officially endorsed by the Catholic Church by such decrees as 
> the papal bull Omne datum optimum of Pope Innocent II, 
> the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom 
> and grew rapidly in membership and power. 
> 
> The Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, 
> were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. 
> They were prominent in Christian finance; non-combatant members of the order, 
> who made up as much as 90% of their members, 
> managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom. 
> 
> They developed innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking, 
> building a network of nearly 1,000 commanderies and fortifications 
> across Europe and the Holy Land. 
>
> The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades. 
> As they became unable to secure their holdings in the Holy Land, support for the order faded. 
> In 1307, King Philip IV of France had many of the order's members in France arrested, 
> tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake. 
> 
> Under pressure from Philip, Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312. 
> In spite of its dissolution, however, between 1317–1319, a number of Templar knights, 
> properties and other assets were absorbed within the Portuguese Order of Christ, 
> and the Spanish Order of Montesa; 
> 
> The abrupt disappearance of this major medieval European institution in its original incarnation 
> gave rise to speculation and legends, which have currently kept the "Templar" name alive 
> in self-styled orders and popular culture.
