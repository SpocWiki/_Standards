## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Holodomor**, also known as the Ukrainian Famine, 
> was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. 
> 
> The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1930–1933 
> which affected the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union.
>
> While scholars are in consensus that the cause of the famine was man-made, 
> it remains in dispute whether the Holodomor was directed at Ukrainians 
> and whether it constitutes a genocide, 
> the point of contention being the absence of attested documents 
> explicitly ordering the starvation of any area in the Soviet Union. 
> 
> Some historians conclude that the famine was deliberately engineered by Joseph Stalin 
> to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. 
> Others suggest that the famine was primarily the consequence of rapid Soviet industrialisation 
> and collectivization of agriculture. 
> A middle position, held for example by historian Andrea Graziosi, is 
> that the initial causes of the famine were an unintentional byproduct of the process of collectivization 
> but once it set in, starvation was selectively weaponized 
> and the famine was "instrumentalized" and amplified against Ukrainians 
> to punish them for their rejection of the "new serfdom" and to break their nationalism.
>
> Ukraine was one of the largest grain-producing states in the USSR 
> and was subject to unreasonably high grain quotas compared to the rest of the USSR. 
> This caused Ukraine to be hit particularly hard by the famine. 
> Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly. 
> A joint statement to the United Nations signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 7 to 10 million died. 
> However, current scholarship estimates a range significantly lower with 3.5 to 5 million victims. 
> The famine's widespread impact on Ukraine persists to this day.
>
> Public discussion of the famine was banned in the Soviet Union 
> until the glasnost period initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s. 
> 
> Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 33 other UN member states, 
> the European Parliament, and 35 of the 50 states of the United States 
> as a genocide against the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government. 
> In 2008, the Russian State Duma condemned the Soviet regime 
> "that has neglected the lives of people for the achievement of economic and political goals".
