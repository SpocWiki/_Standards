> The **Great Famine of 1315–1317** (occasionally dated 1315–1322) 
> was the first of a series of large-scale crises that struck parts of Europe early in the 14th century. 
> 
> Most of Europe (extending east to Poland and south to the Alps) was affected. 
> The famine caused many deaths over an extended number of years 
> and marked a clear end to the period of growth and prosperity from the 11th to the 13th centuries. 
>
> The Great Famine started with bad weather in spring 1315. 
> Crop failures lasted through 1316 until the summer harvest in 1317, 
> and Europe did not fully recover until 1322. 
> 
> Crop failures were not the only problem; 
> cattle disease caused sheep and cattle numbers to fall as much as 80 per cent. 
> 
> The period was marked by extreme levels of crime, disease, mass death, 
> and even cannibalism and infanticide. 
> 
> The crisis had consequences for the Church, state, European society, 
> and for future calamities to follow in the 14th century.
