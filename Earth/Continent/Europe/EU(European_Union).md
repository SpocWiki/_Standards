## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The European Union (EU) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. 
> The Union has a total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated total population of over 448 million. 
> The EU has often been described as a political entity 'sui generis' (without precedent or comparison) 
> combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.
>
> Containing 5.8% of the world population in 2020, 
> EU member states generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$16.6 trillion in 2022, 
> constituting approximately one sixth of global nominal GDP. 
> Additionally, all EU states except Bulgaria have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme. 
> Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation 
> that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. 
> 
> EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; 
> and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. 
> Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the [[Schengen-Area]]. 
> 
> The [[Eurozone]] is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the economic and monetary union and use the euro currency. 
> Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. 
> It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. 
> Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower.
>
> The EU was established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, 
> and was incorporated as an international legal juridical person upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. 
> 
> Its beginnings can be traced to the [[Inner_Six_states]] (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) 
> at the start of modern European integration in 1948, 
> and to the Western Union, the International Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel Community, 
> the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, which were established by treaties. 
> 
> These increasingly amalgamated bodies grew, with their legal successor the EU, 
> both in size through the accessions of a further 22 states from 1973 to 2013, 
> and in power through acquisitions of policy areas.
>
> In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU, in 2020; 
> ten countries are aspiring or negotiating to join it.
