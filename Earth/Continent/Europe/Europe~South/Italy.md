> **Italy**, officially the Italian Republic, is a country in Southern and Western Europe. 
> It is located on a peninsula that extends into the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, 
> with the Alps on its northern land border, 
> as well as several islands, notably Sicily and Sardinia. 
> 
> Italy shares its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia 
> and two enclaves: Vatican City and San Marino. 
> 
> Its territory also includes Campione (an exclave surrounded by Switzerland) 
> and the Pelagie Islands (an archipelago in the African Plate). 
> 
> It is the tenth-largest country by land area in the European continent, 
> covering an area of 301,340 km2 (116,350 sq mi), 
> and the third-most populous member state of the European Union, 
> with a population of nearly 60 million. Its capital and largest city is Rome.
>
> In antiquity, the Italian peninsula was home to numerous peoples; 
> the Latin city of Rome in central Italy, founded as a Kingdom, 
> became a Republic that conquered the Mediterranean world 
> and ruled it for centuries as an Empire. 
> 
> With the spread of Christianity, 
> Rome became the seat of the Catholic Church and of the Papacy. 
> 
> During the Early Middle Ages, Italy experienced the fall of the Western Roman Empire 
> and inward migration from Germanic tribes. 
> 
> By the 11th century, Italian city-states and maritime republics expanded, 
> bringing renewed prosperity through commerce 
> and laying the groundwork for modern capitalism. 
> 
> The Italian Renaissance flourished in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries 
> and spread to the rest of Europe. 
> 
> Italian explorers also discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World, 
> leading the European Age of Discovery. 
> 
> However, centuries of rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states 
> among other factors left the peninsula divided into numerous states 
> until the late modern period. 
> 
> During the 17th and 18th centuries, Italian economic and commercial importance waned significantly. 
> 
> After centuries of political and territorial divisions, 
> Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861, following wars of independence 
> and the [[Expedition_of_the_Thousand]], establishing the Kingdom of Italy. 
> 
> From the late 19th to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialized, 
> mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire, 
> while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialization, 
> fueling a large immigrant diaspora to the Americas. 
> 
> From 1915 to 1918, Italy took part in World War I 
> on the side of the Entente against the Central Powers. 
> 
> In 1922, following a period of crisis and turmoil, 
> the Italian fascist dictatorship was established. 
> 
> During World War II, Italy was first part of the Axis 
> until its surrender to the Allied powers (1940–1943) and then, 
> as parts of its territory were occupied by Nazi Germany with fascist collaboration, 
> a co-belligerent of the Allies during the Italian resistance 
> and the liberation of Italy (1943–1945). 
> 
> Following the end of the war, the monarchy was replaced by a republic, via a referendum; 
> and the country enjoyed a strong recovery, 
> which resulted in prolonged prosperity that is often termed "the economic miracle".
> 
> Italy has the eighth-largest nominal GDP in the world, 
> the second-largest manufacturing industry in Europe (7th-largest in the world), 
> and a significant role in regional 
> and global economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. 
> 
> Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union, 
> and it is in numerous international institutions, including NATO, 
> the G7, the Mediterranean Union, and the Latin Union. 
> 
> As a cultural superpower, Italy has long been 
> a renowned centre of art, music, literature, cuisine, fashion, science and technology, 
> and the source of multiple inventions and discoveries. 
> 
> It has the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (59), 
> and is the world's fifth-most visited country.
