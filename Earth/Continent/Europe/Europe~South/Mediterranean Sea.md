> The **Mediterranean Sea** is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, 
> surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: 
> on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, 
> on the east by the Levant in West Asia, and on the west almost by the Morocco–Spain border. 
> 
> The Mediterranean has played a central role in the history of Western civilization. 
> Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago, 
> the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated 
> over a period of some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis 
> before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.
>
> The Mediterranean Sea covers an area of about 2,500,000 km², 
> representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface, 
> but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar—
> the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea 
> and separates the Iberian Peninsula in Europe from Morocco in Africa—is only 14 km (9 mi) wide. 
> 
> The Mediterranean Sea encompasses a vast number of islands, some of them of volcanic origin. 
> The two largest islands, in both area and population, are Sicily and Sardinia.
>
> The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) 
> and the deepest recorded point is 5,109 ± 1 m (16,762 ± 3 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. 
> 
> It lies between latitudes 30° and 46° N and longitudes 6° W and 36° E. 
> Its west–east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Alexandretta, 
> on the southeastern coast of Turkey, is about 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi). 
> 
> The north–south length varies greatly between different shorelines 
> and whether only straight routes are considered. 
> Also including longitudinal changes, the shortest shipping route 
> between the multinational Gulf of Trieste and the Libyan coastline of the Gulf of Sidra 
> is about 1,900 kilometres (1,200 mi). 
> The water temperatures are mild in winter and warm in summer 
> and give name to the Mediterranean climate type 
> due to the majority of precipitation falling in the cooler months. 
> Its southern and eastern coastlines are lined with hot deserts not far inland, 
> but the immediate coastline on all sides of the Mediterranean 
> tends to have strong maritime moderation.
>
> The sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times, 
> facilitating trade and cultural exchange between the peoples of the region. 
> 
> The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to 
> understanding the origins and development of many modern societies. 
> The Roman Empire maintained nautical hegemony over the sea for centuries 
> and is the only state to have ever controlled all of its coast.
>
> The countries surrounding the Mediterranean and its marginal seas in clockwise order are 
> Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, 
> Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco; 
> Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea. 
> 
> In addition, two overseas territories of the United Kingdom, 
> Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia, have coastlines on the Mediterranean. 
> The drainage basin encompasses a large number of other countries, 
> the Nile being the longest river ending in the Mediterranean Sea.
