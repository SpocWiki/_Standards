> **Spain**, or the Kingdom of Spain, is a country located in Southwestern Europe, 
> with parts of its territory in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and Africa. 
> It is the largest country in Southern Europe 
> and the fourth-most populous European Union member state. 
> Spanning across the majority of the Iberian Peninsula, its territory also includes 
> - the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, 
> - the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, 
> - and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in Africa. 
> 
> Peninsular Spain is bordered to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; 
> to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar; 
> and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. 
> 
> Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, 
> and other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Zaragoza, Seville, 
> Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and Bilbao.
>
> In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by Celtic and Iberian tribes, 
> along with other local pre-Roman peoples. 
> 
> With the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the province of Hispania was established. 
> Following the Romanization and Christianization of Hispania, 
> the fall of the Western Roman Empire ushered in 
> the inward migration of tribes from Central Europe, 
> including the Visigoths, who formed the Visigothic Kingdom centred on Toledo. 
> 
> In the early eighth century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, 
> and during early Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power 
> centred in Córdoba. 
> 
> Several Christian kingdoms emerged in Northern Iberia, 
> chief among them Asturias, León, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal; 
> made an intermittent southward military expansion and repopulation, 
> known as the Reconquista, repelling Islamic rule in Iberia, 
> which culminated with the Christian seizure of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. 
> 
> The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1479 
> under the Catholic Monarchs is often considered 
> the de facto unification of Spain as a nation-state.
>
> During the Age of Discovery, Spain pioneered the exploration of the New World 
> and the first circumnavigation of the globe. 
> At the same time, it formed one of the largest empires in history through colonization. 
> The Spanish empire reached a global scale and spread across continents, 
> underpinning the rise of a global trading system fueled primarily by precious metals. 
> 
> The 18th century was marked by extensive reforms and, notably, 
> the Bourbon reforms centralized mainland Spain. 
> 
> In the 19th century, after the Napoleonic occupation 
> and the victorious Spanish War of independence, 
> the following political divisions between liberals and absolutists 
> led to the breakaway of most of the American colonies. 
> 
> These political divisions finally converged in the 20th century with the Spanish Civil War, 
> giving rise to the Francoist dictatorship that lasted until 1975. 
> 
> With the restoration of democracy and its entry into the European Union, 
> the country experienced an economic boom 
> that profoundly transformed it socially and politically. 
> 
> Since the Siglo de Oro, Spanish art, architecture, music, poetry, painting, literature, 
> and cuisine have been influential worldwide, particularly in Western Europe and the Americas. 
> 
> Spain is one of the main nations of Latin Europe and a cultural superpower. 
> As a reflection of its large cultural wealth, Spain is the world's second-most visited country, 
> has one of the world's largest numbers of World Heritage Sites, 
> and it's the most popular destination for European students. 
> 
> Its cultural influence extends to over 600 million Hispanophones, 
> making Spanish the world's second-most spoken native language 
> and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. 
> 
> Spain is a secular parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, 
> with King Felipe VI as head of state. 
> 
> It is a major advanced capitalist economy, 
> with the world's fifteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP (fourth of the European Union) 
> and the fifteenth-largest by PPP. 
> 
> Spain is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, the eurozone, 
> North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a permanent guest of the G20, 
> and is part of many other international organizations such as the Council of Europe (CoE), 
> the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI), the Union for the Mediterranean, 
> the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 
> the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), 
> and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
