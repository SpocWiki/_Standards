> The Treaty of Lisbon (initially known as the Reform Treaty) 
> is an international agreement that amends the two treaties 
> which form the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU). 
> 
> The Treaty of Lisbon, which was signed by all EU member states on 13 December 2007, 
> entered into force on 1 December 2009. 
> 
> It amends the Maastricht Treaty (1992), 
> known in updated form as the Treaty on European Union (2007) or TEU, 
> as well as the Treaty of Rome (1957), known in updated form as the 
> Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2007) or TFEU. 
> It also amends the attached treaty protocols 
> as well as the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).
>
> Prominent changes included the move from unanimity to qualified majority voting 
> in at least 45 policy areas in the Council of Ministers, 
> a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority, 
> a more powerful European Parliament 
> forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of Ministers 
> under the ordinary legislative procedure, 
> a consolidated legal personality for the EU 
> and the creation of a long-term President of the European Council 
> and a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. 
> 
> The Treaty also made the Union's bill of rights, 
> the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. 
> For the first time, the treaty gave member states the explicit legal __right to leave the EU__, 
> and established a procedure by which to do so.
>
> The stated aim of the treaty was to "complete the process 
> started by the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) and by the Treaty of Nice (2001) 
> with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union 
> and to improving the coherence of its action". 
> 
> Opponents of the Treaty of Lisbon, 
> such as former Danish Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Jens-Peter Bonde, 
> argued that it would centralize the EU, and weaken democracy 
> by "moving power away" from national electorates. 
> Supporters argue that it brings more checks and balances into the EU system, 
> with stronger powers for the European Parliament and a new role for national parliaments.
>
> Negotiations to modify EU institutions began in 2001, 
> resulting first in the proposed Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, 
> which would have repealed the existing European treaties 
> and replaced them with a "constitution". 
> 
> Although ratified by a majority of member states, this was abandoned 
> after being rejected by 55% of French voters on 29 May 2005 and 
> then by 61% of Dutch voters on 1 June 2005. 
> 
> After a "period of reflection", member states agreed instead 
> to maintain the existing treaties and amend them, 
> to bring into law a number of the reforms 
> that had been envisaged in the abandoned constitution. 
> 
> An amending "reform" treaty was drawn up and signed in Lisbon in 2007. 
> It was originally intended to have been ratified by all member states by the end of 2008. 
> This timetable failed, primarily due to the initial rejection of the Treaty 
> in June 2008 by the Irish electorate, 
> a decision which was reversed in a second referendum in October 2009 
> after Ireland secured a number of concessions related to the treaty.
