## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The European Free Trade Association (**EFTA**) is a regional trade organization 
> and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. 
> The organization operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), 
> and all four member states participate in the European Single Market 
> and are part of the Schengen Area. 
> They are not, however, party to the European Union Customs Union.
>
> EFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs, 
> but is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor, 
> the European Union. 
> It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an alternative trade bloc 
> for those European states that were unable or unwilling 
> to join the then European Economic Community (EEC), the main predecessor of the EU. 
> 
> The Stockholm Convention (1960), to establish the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 
> in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the "outer seven": Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). 
> 
> A revised Convention, the Vaduz Convention, was signed on 21 June 2001 
> and entered into force on 1 June 2002.
>
> After 1995 only two founding members remained, namely Norway and Switzerland. 
> The other five, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, 
> had joined the EU at some point in the intervening years. 
> 
> The initial Stockholm Convention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, 
> which aimed to provide a successful framework 
> for continuing the expansion and liberalization of trade, 
> both among the organization's member states and with the rest of the world.
>
> While the EFTA is not a customs union and 
> member states have full rights to enter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, 
> it does have a coordinated trade policy. 
> As a result, its member states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with the EU 
> and a number of other countries. 
> To participate in the EU's single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway 
> are parties to the Agreement on a [[EEA(European Economic Area)]], 
> with compliances regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. 
> Switzerland has a set of multilateral agreements with the EU and its member states instead.
