> **Austria**, formally the Republic of Austria, 
> is a landlocked country in Central Europe, lying in the Eastern Alps. 
> It is a federation of nine federal states, one of which is the capital, 
> Vienna, the most populous city and federal state. 
> 
> Austria is bordered by Germany to the northwest, the Czech Republic to the north, 
> Slovakia to the northeast, Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, 
> and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. 
> 
> The country occupies an area of 83,879 km2 (32,386 sq mi) 
> and has a population of around 9 million. 
> 
> Austria emerged from the remnants of the Eastern and Hungarian March 
> at the end of the first millennium. 
> 
> Originally a margraviate of Bavaria, 
> it developed into a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in 1156 
> and was later made an archduchy in 1453. 
> 
> In the 16th century, Vienna began serving as the empire's administrative capital 
> and Austria thus became the heartland of the Habsburg monarchy. 
> 
> Before the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire two years later, in 1804, 
> Austria established its own empire, which became a great power 
> and the dominant member of the German Confederation. 
> 
> The empire's defeat in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 led to the end of the Confederation 
> and paved the way for the establishment of Austria-Hungary a year later, 
> Austria was its part with the name Cisleithania.
>
> After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, 
> Emperor Franz Joseph declared war on Serbia, which ultimately escalated into World War I. 
> 
> The empire's defeat and subsequent collapse 
> led to the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918 
> and the First Austrian Republic in 1919. 
> 
> During the interwar period, anti-parliamentarian sentiments 
> culminated in the formation of an Austrofascist dictatorship 
> under Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934. 
> 
> A year before the outbreak of World War II, Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany 
> by Adolf Hitler, and it became a sub-national division. 
> 
> After its liberation in 1945 and a decade of Allied occupation, 
> the country regained its sovereignty and declared its perpetual neutrality in 1955.
>
> Austria is a semi-presidential representative democracy 
> with a popularly elected president as head of state 
> and a chancellor as head of government and chief executive. 
> 
> Major cities include Vienna, Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. 
> Austria has the 17th highest nominal GDP per capita with high standards of living; 
> it was ranked 25th in the world for its Human Development Index in 2021.
>
> Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 
> and of the European Union since 1995. 
> 
> It hosts the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) 
> and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
> and is a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Interpol. 
> 
> It also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995, and adopted the euro currency in 1999.
