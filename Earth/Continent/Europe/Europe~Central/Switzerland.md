> **Switzerland**, officially the Swiss Confederation, 
> is a landlocked country located in west-central Europe. 
> It is bordered by [[Italy]] to the south, [[France]] to the west, [[Germany]] to the north 
> and [[Austria]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the east. 
> 
> Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; 
> the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, 
> whereas most of the country's population of 9 million are concentrated on the plateau, 
> which hosts its largest cities and economic centres, 
> including Zürich, Geneva and Basel. 
> 
> Switzerland originates from the Old [[Swiss_Confederacy]] established in the Late Middle Ages, 
> following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; 
> the [[Federal_Charter_of_1291]] is considered the country's founding document. 
> 
> Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was __formally recognized__ 
> in the [[Peace_of_Westphalia]] in 1648. 
> 
> Switzerland has maintained a policy of __armed neutrality since the 16th century__ 
> and has __not fought an international war since 1815__. 
> It __joined the United Nations only in 2002__ but pursues an active foreign policy 
> that includes __frequent involvement in peace building__. 
> 
> Switzerland is the birthplace of the [[Red_Cross]] 
> and hosts the headquarters or offices of most major international institutions, 
> including the [[WTO]], the [[WHO]], the [[ILO]], [[FIFA]], and the [[../../../_Standards/UN(United_Nations)]]. 
> 
> It is a founding member of the [[EFTA(European_Free_Trade_Association)]], 
> but not part of the [[../EU(European_Union)]], the European Economic Area, or the eurozone; 
> however, it participates in the European single market and the [[../Schengen-Area]]. 
> 
> Switzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, 
> with federal authorities based in Bern. 
> 
> Switzerland is one of the world's most developed countries, 
> with the __highest nominal wealth per adult__ 
> and the __eighth-highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita__. 
> 
> Switzerland ranks first in the Human Development Index since 2021 
> and performs highly also on several international metrics, 
> including economic competitiveness and democratic governance. 
> 
> Cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality of life, 
> albeit with some of the highest costs of living. 
> 
> It has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. 
> Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is fairly cohesive, 
> being rooted in a common historical background, 
> shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. 
> 
> Swiss identity transcends language, ethnicity, and religion, 
> leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnation ("nation of volition") 
> rather than a nation state. 
> 
> Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by multiple native names: 
> - Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German); 
> - Suisse [sɥis(ə)]  (French); 
> - Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and 
> - Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh). 
> 
> On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica—frequently shortened to "Helvetia"—is used instead of the spoken languages.

## Government 

[Direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy") and [federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism "Federalism") are hallmarks of the Swiss political system. 
Three main bodies govern on the federal level:[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland#cite_note-94) the [bicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism "Bicameralism") parliament (legislative), the [Federal Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Council "Swiss Federal Council") (executive) and the [Federal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland "Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland") (judicial).
the [Council of States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Council_of_States "Swiss Council of States") which has 46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each [half-canton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-canton "Half-canton")) who are elected under a system determined by each canton, and the [National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Switzerland "National Council of Switzerland"), which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation "Proportional representation"), reflecting each canton's population.

## Military 

Switzerland has no Navy. 
The Swiss militia system stipulates that soldiers keep their army-issued equipment, 
including [fully automatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_firearm "Automatic firearm") personal weapons, at home. Women can serve voluntarily. 
Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18. 
About two-thirds of young Swiss are found suitable for service; 
for the others, various forms of alternative service are available.

[Gun politics in Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland "Gun politics in Switzerland") are unique in Europe in that 
2–3.5 million guns are in the hands of civilians, giving the nation 
an estimate of 28–41 guns per 100 people. 
As per the Small Arms Survey, only 324,484 guns are owned by the military. 
Only 143,372 are in the hands of soldiers. However, ammunition is no longer issued.
