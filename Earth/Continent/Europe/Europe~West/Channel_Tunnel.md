## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Channel Tunnel (French: Tunnel sous la Manche, sometimes referred by the portmanteau Chunnel) 
> is a 50.46-kilometre (31.35-mile) railway tunnel beneath the English Channel 
> that links Folkestone in the United Kingdom with Coquelles in France. 
> Opened in 1994, 
> it is the only fixed connection between Great Britain and the European mainland.
>
> The tunnel has the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world, 
> at 37.9 km (23.5 miles), and reaches a depth of 75 m (246 ft) below the sea bed 
> and 115 m (377 ft) below sea level. 
> 
> It is the third-longest railway tunnel in the world. 
> Although the tunnel was designed for speeds up to 200 km/h (120 mph), 
> trains are limited to a maximum speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) for safety reasons. 
> It connects to high-speed railway lines on either end: 
> the LGV Nord in France and High Speed 1 in England.
>
> The tunnel is operated by Getlink (formerly Eurotunnel) 
> and is used by Eurostar high-speed passenger trains, 
> LeShuttle services for road vehicles, and freight trains. 
> 
> In 2017, Eurostar trains carried 10.3 million passengers, 
> freight trains transported 1.2 million tonnes (2.6 billion pounds) of freight, 
> and LeShuttle trains moved 10.4 million passengers in 2.6 million cars and 51,000 coaches, 
> and 1.6 million heavy goods vehicles carrying 21.3 million tonnes (47 billion pounds) of freight. 
> That compares with 11.7 million passengers, 2.2 million cars, 
> and 2.6 million heavy goods vehicles transported by sea through the Port of Dover.
>
> Proposals for a cross-Channel tunnel date to as early as 1802, 
> but concerns over national security delayed development. 
> 
> The modern project was initiated by Eurotunnel in 1988 and completed in 1994, 
> at a final cost of £4.65 billion (equivalent to £11.7 billion in 2023). 
> Despite its engineering significance, 
> economic assessments have found that it had only limited positive economic impact to British economy.
>
> Since its opening, the tunnel has experienced occasional service disruptions 
> due to technical faults, fires, severe weather, 
> and unauthorized access by migrants around Calais seeking entry to the United Kingdom.
