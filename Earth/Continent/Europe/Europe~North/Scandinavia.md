> **Scandinavia** is a subregion of northern Europe, 
> with strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties between its constituent peoples. 
> 
> Scandinavia most commonly refers to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. 
> It can sometimes also refer to the Scandinavian Peninsula 
> (which excludes Denmark but includes a part of northern Finland). 
> 
> In English usage, Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for Nordic countries. 
> Iceland and the Faroe Islands are sometimes included in Scandinavia 
> for their ethnolinguistic relations with Sweden, Norway and Denmark. 
> While Finland differs from other Nordic countries in this respect, 
> some authors call it Scandinavian due to its economic and cultural similarities.
>
> The geography of the region is varied, from the Norwegian fjords in the west 
> and Scandinavian mountains covering parts of Norway and Sweden, 
> to the low and flat areas of Denmark in the south, as well as archipelagos and lakes in the east. 
> Most of the population in the region live in the more temperate southern regions, 
> with the northern parts having long, cold winters.
>
> During the Viking Age Scandinavian peoples participated in 
> large-scale raiding, conquest, colonization and trading mostly throughout Europe. 
> They also used their longships for exploration, 
> becoming the first Europeans to reach North America. 
> 
> These exploits saw the establishment of the North Sea Empire 
> which comprised large parts of Scandinavia and Great Britain, though it was relatively short-lived. 
> 
> Scandinavia was eventually Christianized, 
> and the coming centuries saw various unions of Scandinavian nations, 
> most notably the Kalmar Union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, which lasted for over 100 years 
> until the Swedish king Gustav I led Sweden out of the union. 
> 
> Denmark and Norway, as well as Schleswig-Holstein, 
> were then united until 1814 as Denmark–Norway. 
> 
> Numerous wars between the nations followed, which shaped the modern borders 
> and led to the establishment of the Swedish Empire in the 17th and early 18th centuries. 
> The most recent Scandinavian union was the union between Sweden and Norway, which ended in 1905.
>
> In modern times the region has prospered, 
> with the economies of the countries being amongst the strongest in Europe. 
> Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland all maintain welfare systems 
> considered to be generous, 
> with the economic and social policies of the countries being dubbed the "Nordic model".
