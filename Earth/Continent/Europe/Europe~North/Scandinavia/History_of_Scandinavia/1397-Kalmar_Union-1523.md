> The Kalmar Union was a personal union in Scandinavia, 
> agreed at Kalmar in Sweden as designed by Queen Margaret of Denmark. 
> 
> From 1397 to 1523, it joined the 3 kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden 
> (then including much of present-day Finland) under a single monarch, 
> together with Norway's overseas colonies (then including Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland).
>
> The union was not quite continuous; there were several short interruptions. 
> 
> Legally, the countries remained separate sovereign states, 
> but their domestic and foreign policies were directed by a common monarch. 
> 
> Gustav Vasa's election as King of Sweden on 6 June 1523, 
> and his triumphant entry into Stockholm 11 days later, 
> marked Sweden's final secession from the Kalmar Union. 
> 
> The Danish king formally renounced his claim to Sweden in 1524 at the Treaty of Malmö.
