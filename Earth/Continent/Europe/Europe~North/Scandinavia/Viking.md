> **Vikings** were a seafaring people originally from Scandinavia 
> (present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden), who from the late 8th to the late 
> 11th centuries raided, pirated, traded, and settled throughout parts of Europe. 
> 
> They voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, 
> Greenland, and Vinland (present-day Newfoundland in Canada, North America). 
> 
> In their countries of origin, and in some of the countries they raided and settled, 
> this period of activity is popularly known as the Viking Age, 
> and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the Scandinavian homelands as a whole during the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries. 
> 
> The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history 
> of northern and Eastern Europe, including 
> - the political and social development of England (and the English language) 
> - and parts of France, 
> - and established the embryo of Russia in Kievan Rus'.
>
> Expert sailors and navigators of their characteristic longships, 
> Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British Isles, 
> the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast, 
> as well as along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes across Eastern Europe 
> where they were also known as Varangians. 
> 
> The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus, Faroese, and Icelanders 
> emerged from these Norse colonies. 
> 
> At one point, a group of Rus Vikings went so far south that, 
> after briefly being bodyguards for the Byzantine emperor, 
> they attacked the Byzantine city of Constantinople. 
> 
> Vikings also voyaged to the Caspian Sea and Arabia. 
> They were the first Europeans to reach North America, 
> briefly settling in Newfoundland (Vinland). 
> 
> While spreading Norse culture to foreign lands, 
> they simultaneously brought home slaves, concubines, 
> and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, 
> influencing the genetic and historical development of both. 
> 
> During the Viking Age, the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated 
> from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
>
> The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions in runes. 
> For most of the Viking Age, they followed the Old Norse religion, 
> but became Christians over the 8th–12th centuries. 
> 
> The Vikings had their own laws, art, and architecture. 
> Most Vikings were also farmers, fishermen, craftsmen, and traders. 
> 
> A romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century; 
> this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th-century Viking revival. 
> Perceived views of the Vikings as violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers 
> owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth 
> that had taken shape by the early 20th century. 
> 
> Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes, 
> complicating modern appreciation of the Viking legacy. 
> These representations are rarely accurate—
> for example, there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, 
> a costume element that first appeared in the 19th century.
