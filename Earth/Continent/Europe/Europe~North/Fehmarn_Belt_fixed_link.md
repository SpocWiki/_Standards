> The Fehmarn Belt fixed link (Danish: Femern Bælt-forbindelsen, German: Fehmarnbelt-Querung) 
> or Fehmarn Belt tunnel is an under-construction immersed tunnel, 
> which will connect the Danish island of Lolland with the German island of Fehmarn, 
> crossing the 18-kilometre-wide (11 mi) Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea. 
> The tunnel is intended to be a major wider connection between mainland Europe and Scandinavia.
>
> The tunnel is planned to become world's longest road and rail (combination) tunnel 
> and will directly replace a heavily travelled ferry service of the "Bird flight line"
>  (German: Vogelfluglinie; Danish: Fugleflugtslinjen) operated by Scandlines. 
>  
>  The tunnel will provide a direct link from northern Germany to Lolland, 
>  with Fehmarn connected with the German mainland by the Fehmarn Sound Bridge 
>  and Lolland connected by a tunnel and bridges with the Danish island of Zealand, 
>  which includes Copenhagen, via the island of Falster. 
>  
>  The Fehmarn Belt project will therefore provide a more direct and efficient connection 
>  between Germany and Zealand (which in turn is connected with the Swedish mainland 
>  via the Øresund Bridge), compared to the existing road-rail link 
>  that is the detoured Great Belt Bridge via Jutland and Funen. 
>  
>  Travel time between Lolland and Fehmarn is to be reduced from 45 minutes by ferry 
>  (excluding waiting and boarding time) to 10 minutes by car and seven minutes by train. 
>  The electrified high-speed rail line will be capable of reaching 200 km/h (125 mph).
>
> Designed and financed by Danish state-owned Femern A/S, 
> the tunnel was approved in 2015 with a construction budget of 52.6 billion krone 
> (equivalent to US$8.2 billion), making it the largest traffic investment in Denmark's history 
> and which will be partly recouped by tolling the tunnel. 
> Germany plans to pay a further €800 million to connect the crossing to its motorway network. 
> The Fehmarnbelt tunnel is currently expected to be completed in 2029.
