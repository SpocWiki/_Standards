> **Ireland** ( , IRE-lənd; Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə] ; Ulster-Scots: Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) 
> is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in Northwestern Europe. 
> It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, 
> the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. 
> 
> Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, 
> and the twentieth-largest in the world. 
> 
> Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), 
> a sovereign state covering five-sixths of the island, 
> and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. 
> 
> As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, 
> with 5.1 million in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, 
> ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.
>
> The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains 
> surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. 
> 
> Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate 
> which is free of extremes in temperature. 
> 
> Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. 
> Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, 
> compared with a European average of over 33%, 
> with most of it being non-native conifer plantations. 
> 
> The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, 
> and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, 
> although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. 
> Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.
>
> Gaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. 
> The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards. 
> During this period Ireland was divided into many petty kingships under provincial kingships 
> (Cúige "fifth" of the traditional provinces) vying for dominance 
> and the title of High King of Ireland. 
> 
> In the late 8th to early 11th century AD, Viking raids and settlement took place 
> culminating in the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014 
> which resulted in the ending of Viking power in Ireland.  
> 
> Following the 12th-century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. 
> However, English rule did not extend over the whole island 
> until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. 
> 
> In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed 
> to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, 
> and was extended during the 18th century. 
> 
> With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. 
> A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, 
> leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, 
> which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades 
> until it declared a republic in 1948 (Republic of Ireland Act, 1948) 
> and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. 
> 
> Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. 
> This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. 
> In 1973, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, 
> with Northern Ireland as part of it, joined the European Economic Community. 
> Following a referendum vote in 2016, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, 
> left the European Union (EU) in 2020. 
> Northern Ireland was granted a limited special status 
> and allowed to operate within the EU single market for goods 
> without being in the European Union.
>
> Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, 
> especially in the field of literature. 
> Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, 
> as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance. 
> The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, 
> including the English language, and sports 
> such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.
