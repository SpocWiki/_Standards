> The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
> commonly known as the United Kingdom (**UK**) or Britain, 
> is a country in Northwestern Europe, 
> off the north-western coast of the continental mainland. 
> 
> It comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
> It includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, 
> and most of the smaller islands within the British Isles. 
> 
> Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland; 
> otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, 
> the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea, and the Irish Sea. 
> 
> The total area of the United Kingdom is 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2), 
> with an estimated population of just over 67 million people in 2021.
> 
> The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions 
> and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. 
> The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) 
> and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification 
> to become the __Kingdom of Great Britain__. 
> Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland 
> created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 
> Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, thus creating the territory of Northern Ireland 
> and the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
> which formally adopted its name in 1927. 
> The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, 
> being Crown Dependencies, 
> but the British government is responsible for their defense and international representation.
> 
> The UK became the first industrialized country 
> and was the world's foremost power for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, 
> particularly during the "Pax Britannica" between 1815 and 1914. 
> 
> The British Empire, at its height in the 1920s, 
> encompassed almost a quarter of the world's landmass and population, 
> and was the largest empire in history; however, its involvement in the First World War and the Second World War damaged Britain's economic power 
> and a global wave of decolonization led to the independence of most British colonies. 
> 
> British influence can be observed in the legal and political systems 
> of many of its former colonies, and the UK's culture remains globally influential, 
> particularly in language, literature, music and sport. 
> 
> English is the world's most widely spoken language 
> and the third-most spoken native language.
> 
> The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. 
> The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom 
> (as well as the capital of England) is London. 
> The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are respectively 
> the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and [[UK/Ireland~North|Northern Ireland]]. 
> Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds. 
> 
> The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: 
> England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. 
> This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems after joining the UK. 
> Since 1998, [[UK/Scotland|Scotland]], [[UK/Wales|Wales]], and Northern Ireland 
> also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.
> 
> The UK has the world's sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), 
> and the ninth-largest by purchasing power parity. 
> 
> It is a recognized nuclear state and is ranked fourth globally in military expenditure. 
> The UK has been a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
> since its first session in 1946. 
> It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, 
> the G7, the OECD, NATO, the Five Eyes, AUKUS and the CPTPP.
