> **Finland**, officially the Republic of Finland, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. 
> It borders Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east, 
> with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south, opposite Estonia. 
> 
> Finland covers an area of 338,145 square kilometres (130,559 sq mi) 
> and has a population of 5.6 million. 
> [[Helsinki]] is the capital and largest city. The vast majority of the population are ethnic Finns. 
> Finnish and Swedish are the official languages, 
> with Swedish being the native language of 5.1% of the population. 
> Finland's climate varies from humid continental in the south to boreal in the north. 
> The land cover is predominantly boreal forest biome, with more than 180,000 recorded lakes.
>
> Finland was first settled around 9000 BC after the last Ice Age. 
> During the Stone Age, various cultures emerged, distinguished by different styles of ceramics. 
> The Bronze Age and Iron Ages were marked 
> by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region. 
> 
> From the late 13th century, Finland became part of the Swedish Empire 
> as a result of the Northern Crusades. 
> 
> In 1809, as a result of the Finnish War, Finland was captured from Sweden 
> and became a Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire. 
> During this period, Finnish art flourished 
> and the idea of full independence began to take hold. 
> 
> In 1906, Finland became the first European state to grant universal suffrage, 
> and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office. 
> 
> Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Finland declared its full independence. 
> In 1918 the young nation was divided by the Finnish Civil War. 
> During World War II, Finland fought against the Soviet Union in the [[Winter War]] 
> and the [[Continuation War]], and later against Nazi Germany in the [[Lapland War]]. 
> As a result, it lost parts of its territory but retained its independence.
>
> Finland remained a largely agricultural country until the 1950s. 
> After World War II, it industrialised quickly and established an advanced economy, 
> with a welfare state built on the Nordic model. 
> This allowed the country to experience overall prosperity and high per capita income. 
> During the Cold War, Finland officially embraced a policy of neutrality. 
> 
> Since then, it has become a member of the [[../EU(European_Union)]] in 1995, 
> the   [[Eurozone]] in 1999, and [[NATO]] in 2023. 
> 
> Finland is a member of various international organisations, such as the United Nations, 
> the Nordic Council, the Schengen Area, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, 
> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
> 
> The nation performs exceedingly well in national performance metrics, including education, 
> economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development.
