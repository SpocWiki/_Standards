## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Greenland** is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. 
> It is by far the largest geographically of three constituent parts of the kingdom; 
> the other two are metropolitan Denmark and the Faroe Islands. 
> It shares a small 1.2 km border with Canada on Hans Island. 
> 
> Citizens of Greenland are full citizens of Denmark and of the European Union. 
> Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union 
> and is part of the Council of Europe. 
> 
> It is the world's largest island, and lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, 
> east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. 
> 
> Greenland's Kaffeklubben Island, off the northern coast, 
> is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land—
> Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s. 
> 
> The capital and largest city is Nuuk. 
> Economically, Greenland is heavily reliant on aid from Denmark, 
> amounting to nearly half of the territory's total public revenue.
>
> Though a part of the continent of North America, 
> Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with the European 
> kingdoms of Norway and Denmark for more than a millennium, beginning in 986. 
> 
> Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years 
> by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada. 
> 
> Norsemen from Norway settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland 
> beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), 
> and their descendants lived in Greenland for 400 years 
> until disappearing in the late 15th century. 
> The 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit.
>
> From the late 15th century, the Portuguese attempted to find the northern route to Asia, 
> which ultimately led to the earliest cartographic depiction of its coastline. 
> In the 17th century, Dano-Norwegian explorers reached Greenland again, 
> finding their earlier settlement extinct 
> and reestablishing a permanent Scandinavian presence on the island. 
> When Denmark and Norway separated in 1814, 
> Greenland was transferred from the Norwegian to the Danish crown. 
> The 1953 Constitution of Denmark ended Greenland's status as a colony, 
> integrating it fully into the Danish state. 
> 
> In the 1979 Greenlandic home rule referendum, Denmark granted home rule to Greenland. 
> In the 2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum, 
> Greenlanders voted for the Self-Government Act, 
> which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local Naalakkersuisut 
> (Greenlandic government). 
> 
> Under this structure, Greenland gradually assumed responsibility 
> for a number of governmental services and areas of competence. 
> The Danish government retains control of citizenship, monetary policy, security policies, 
> and foreign affairs. 
> 
> With the melting of the ice due to global warming, its abundance of mineral wealth, 
> and its strategic position between Eurasia, North America and the Arctic zone, 
> Greenland holds strategic importance for the Kingdom of Denmark, NATO, and the EU.
>
> Most residents of Greenland are Inuit. 
> The population is concentrated mainly on the southwest coast, 
> strongly influenced by climatic and geographical factors, 
> and the rest of the island is sparsely populated. 
> 
> With a population of 56,583 (2022), 
> Greenland is the least densely populated country in the world. 
> 
> Greenland is socially progressive, like metropolitan Denmark; 
> education and healthcare are free, and LGBTQ rights in Greenland 
> are some of the most extensive in the world. 
> 
> Sixty-seven percent of its electricity production comes from renewable energy, 
> mostly from hydropower.
