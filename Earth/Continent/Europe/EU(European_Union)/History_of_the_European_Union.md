> The European Union is a geo-political entity, created in 1993, 
> covering a large portion of the European continent. 
> It is founded upon numerous treaties and has undergone expansions and secessions 
> that have taken it from six member states to 27, a majority of the states in Europe.
>
> Since the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration in 1948, 
> the development of the European Union has been based on a supranational foundation 
> that would "make war unthinkable and materially impossible" 
> and reinforce democracy amongst its members as laid out by Robert Schuman and other leaders 
> in the Schuman Declaration (1950) and the Europe Declaration (1951). 
> 
> This principle was at the heart of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (1951), 
> the Treaty of Paris (1951), and later the Treaty of Rome (1957) 
> which established the European Economic Community (EEC) 
> and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). 
> 
> The Maastricht Treaty (1992) created the European Union with its pillars system, 
> including foreign and home affairs alongside the European Communities. 
> 
> This in turn led to the creation of the single European currency, the euro (launched 1999). 
> The ECSC expired in 2002. 
> The Maastricht Treaty has been amended by the treaties of Amsterdam (1997), Nice (2001) 
> and Lisbon (2007), the latter merging the three pillars into a single legal entity, 
> though the EAEC has maintained a distinct legal identity despite sharing members and institutions.
