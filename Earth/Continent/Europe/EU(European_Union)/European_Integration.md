> European integration is the process of political, legal, social, regional 
> and economic integration of states wholly or partially in Europe, or nearby. 
> 
> European integration has primarily but not exclusively come about 
> through the European Union and its policies, and can include cultural assimilation and centralisation.
>
> The history of European integration is 
> marked by the Roman Empire's consolidation of European and Mediterranean territories, 
> which set a precedent for the notion of a unified Europe. 
> 
> This idea was echoed through attempts at unity, such as the Holy Roman Empire, 
> the Hanseatic League, and the Napoleonic Empire. 
> 
> The devastation of World War I reignited the concept of a unified Europe, 
> leading to the establishment of international organizations 
> aimed at political coordination across Europe. 
> 
> The interwar period saw politicians such as Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi 
> and Aristide Briand advocating for European unity, albeit with differing visions.
>
> Post-World War II Europe saw a significant push towards integration, 
> with Winston Churchill's call for a "United States of Europe" in 1946 being a notable example. 
> 
> This period saw the formation of theories around European integration, 
> categorizing into proto-integration, explaining integration, analyzing governance, 
> and constructing the EU, reflecting a shift from viewing European integration as a unique process, 
> to incorporating broader international relations and comparative politics theories.
>
> Citizens' organizations have played a role in advocating further European integration, 
> exemplified by the Union of European Federalists and the European Movement International. 
> 
> Various agreements and memberships demonstrate the web of relations and commitments 
> between European countries, showing the multi-layered nature of integration.
