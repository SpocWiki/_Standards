> The European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or EURATOM) is an international organization 
> established by the Euratom Treaty of 1957 
> with the original purpose of creating a specialist market for nuclear power in Europe, 
> by developing nuclear energy and distributing it to its member states 
> while selling the surplus to non-member states. 
> 
> Having become one of the three European Communities 
> alongside the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community 
> following the merger of their executive bodies in 1967, 
> the Euratom is de facto under the authority of the European Union (EU) 
> but remains de jure a separate organization.
>
> It is legally distinct from the European Union although it has the same membership, and is governed by many of the EU's institutions; but it is the only remaining community organization that is independent of the EU and therefore outside the regulatory control of the European Parliament. Over the years its scope has been increased to cover a variety of areas associated with nuclear power and ionising radiation as diverse as safeguarding of nuclear materials, radiation protection, coordinating EU members' nuclear research programmes for peaceful purposes, and construction of the International Fusion Reactor.
>
> Since 2014, Switzerland has also participated in Euratom programmes as an associated state. The United Kingdom ceased to be a full member of the organization on 31 January 2020. However, under the terms of the EUâ€“UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the United Kingdom participates in Euratom as an associated state following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.
