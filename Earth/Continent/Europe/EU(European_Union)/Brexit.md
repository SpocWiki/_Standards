> **Brexit** (a portmanteau of "British exit") 
> was the withdrawal of the [[../Europe~North/UK|United Kingdom]] (UK) from the [[../EU(European_Union)|European Union]] (EU). 
> Following a referendum held in the UK on 23 June 2016, 
> Brexit officially took place at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020. 
> 
> The UK, which joined the EU's precursors the European Communities (EC) on 1 January 1973, 
> is the only member state to have withdrawn from the EU. 
> Following Brexit, EU law and the Court of Justice of the European Union 
> no longer have primacy over British laws. 
> The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, 
> which the UK can amend or repeal. 
>
> The EU and its institutions developed gradually after their establishment. 
> Throughout the period of British membership, Eurosceptic groups had existed in the UK, 
> opposing aspects of the EU and its predecessors. 
> The Labour prime minister Harold Wilson's pro-EC government 
> held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975, 
> in which 67.2 per cent of those voting chose to stay within the bloc. 
> 
> Despite growing political opposition to further European integration 
> aimed at "ever closer union" between 1975 and 2016, 
> notably from factions of the Conservative Party in the 1980s to 2000s, 
> no further referendums on the issue were held.
>
> By the 2010s, the growing popularity of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), 
> as well as pressure from Eurosceptics in his own party, 
> persuaded the Conservative prime minister David Cameron 
> to promise a referendum on British membership of the EU if his government were re
> 
> -elected. Following the 2015 general election, 
> which produced a small but unexpected overall majority for the governing Conservative Party, 
> the promised referendum on continued EU membership was held on 23 June 2016. 
> Notable supporters of the Remain campaign included Cameron, 
> the future prime ministers Theresa May and Liz Truss, 
> and the ex–prime ministers John Major, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown; 
> notable supporters of the Leave campaign included the 
> future prime ministers Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. 
> 
> The electorate voted to leave the EU with a 51.9% share of the vote, 
> with all regions of England and Wales except London voting in favour of Brexit, 
> and Scotland and Northern Ireland voting against. 
> The result led to Cameron's sudden resignation, his replacement by Theresa May, 
> and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and on future relations, 
> completed under a Boris Johnson government, 
> with government control remaining with the Conservative Party during this period.
>
> The negotiation process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, 
> leading to two snap elections in 2017 and 2019. 
> One deal was overwhelmingly rejected by the British parliament, 
> causing great uncertainty and leading to postponement of the withdrawal date 
> to avoid a no-deal Brexit. 
> The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 after a withdrawal deal was passed by Parliament, 
> but continued to participate in many EU institutions (including the single market and customs union) 
> during an eleven-month transition period in order to ensure frictionless trade 
> until all details of the post-Brexit relationship were agreed and implemented. 
> 
> Trade deal negotiations continued within days of the scheduled end of the transition period, 
> and the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was signed on 30 December 2020. 
> The effects of Brexit are in part determined by the cooperation agreement, 
> which provisionally applied from 1 January 2021, until it formally came into force on 1 May 2021.
