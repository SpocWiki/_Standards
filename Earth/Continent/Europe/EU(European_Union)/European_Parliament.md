> The European Parliament (EP) is one of the two legislative bodies of the European Union (EU) 
> and one of its seven institutions. 
> 
> Together with the Council of the European Union (known as the Council 
> and informally as the Council of Ministers), it adopts European legislation, 
> following a proposal by the European Commission. 
> 
> The Parliament is composed of 720 members (MEPs), after the June 2024 European elections, 
> from a previous 705 MEPs.
>  It represents the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India), 
>  with an electorate of around 375 million eligible voters in 2025.
>
> Since 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years 
> by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. 
> 
> Voter turnout in parliamentary elections decreased each time after 1979 
> until 2019, when voter turnout increased by eight percentage points, 
> and rose above 50% for the first time since 1994. 
> The voting age is 18 in all EU member states 
> except for Malta, Belgium, Austria and Germany, where it is 16, and Greece, where it is 17.
>
> The European Parliament has legislative power in that 
> the adoption of EU legislation normally requires its approval, 
> and that of the Council, in what amounts to a bicameral legislature.  
> 
> However, it does not formally possess the right of initiative 
> (i.e. the right to formally initiate the legislative procedure) 
> in the way that most national parliaments of the member states do, 
> as the right of initiative is a prerogative of the European Commission. 
> 
> Nonetheless, the Parliament and the Council each have the right 
> to request the Commission to initiate the legislative procedure and put forward a proposal.
>
> The Parliament is, in protocol terms, the "first institution" of the European Union (mentioned first in its treaties and having ceremonial precedence over the other EU institutions), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except on a few issues where special legislative procedures apply). It likewise has equal control over the EU budget. Ultimately, the European Commission, which serves as the executive branch of the EU, is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament can decide whether or not to approve the European Council's nominee for President of the Commission, and is further tasked with approving (or rejecting) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the current Commission to resign by adopting a motion of censure.
>
> The president of the European Parliament is the body's speaker and presides over the multi-party chamber. The five largest political groups are the European People's Party Group (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), Patriots for Europe (PfE), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), and Renew Europe (Renew). The last EU-wide election was held in 2024.
>
> The Parliament's headquarters are officially in Strasbourg, France, and has its administrative offices in Luxembourg City. Plenary sessions are normally held in Strasbourg for four days a month, but sometimes there are additional sessions in Brussels, while the Parliament's committee meetings are held primarily in Brussels, Belgium. In practice, the Parliament works three weeks per month in Brussels and one week (four days) in Strasbourg.
