> The Balkans, partly corresponding with the Balkan Peninsula, encompasses areas 
> that may also be placed in Southeastern, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe. 
> 
> The distinct identity and fragmentation of the Balkans owes much to its often turbulent history, 
> with the region experiencing centuries of Ottoman conflict and conquest. 
> 
> The Balkan Peninsula is predominantly mountainous, 
> featuring several mountain ranges such as the Dinaric Alps, 
> the Pindus Mountains and the Balkan Mountains.
