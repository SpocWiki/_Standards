> The Balkan mountain range is located in the eastern part of the Balkan peninsula in Southeastern Europe. 
> It is conventionally taken to begin at the peak of Vrashka Chuka 
> on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia. 
> 
> It then runs for about 560 kilometres (350 mi), first in a south-easterly direction along the border, 
> then eastward across Bulgaria, forming a natural barrier 
> between the northern and southern halves of the country, 
> before finally reaching the Black Sea at Cape Emine. 
> The mountains reach their highest point with Botev Peak at 2,376 metres (7,795 ft).
>
> In much of the central and eastern sections, 
> the summit forms the watershed between the drainage basins of the Black Sea and the Aegean. 
> A prominent gap in the mountains is formed by the predominantly narrow Iskar Gorge, 
> a few miles north of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. 
> The karst relief determines the large number of caves, including Magura, 
> featuring the most important and extended European post-Palaeolithic cave painting, 
> Ledenika, Saeva dupka, Bacho Kiro, etc. 
> 
> The most notable rock formation are the Belogradchik Rocks in the west.
>
> There are several important protected areas: Central Balkan National Park, Vrachanski Balkan, Bulgarka and Sinite Kamani, as well as a number of nature reserves. 
> 
> The Balkan Mountains are remarkable for their flora and fauna. 
> Edelweiss grows there in the region of Kozyata stena. 
> Some of the most striking landscapes are included in the Central Balkan National Park 
> with steep cliffs, the highest waterfalls in the Balkans and lush vegetation. 
> 
> There are a number of important nature reserves such as Chuprene, Kozyata stena and others. 
> Most of Europe's large mammals inhabit the area including the brown bear, wolf, boar, chamois and deer.
>
> The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkans 
> (sometimes considered as a distinct peninsula or region). 
> In Bulgarian and Serbian the mountains are also known as Стара планина Stara planina 
> (pronounced in Bulgarian as [ˈstarɐ pɫɐniˈna] and in Serbian as [stâːraː planǐna]), 
> a term whose literal meaning is 'old mountain'.
