> The **Balkans** ( BAWL-kənz,  BOL-kənz), corresponding partially with the Balkan Peninsula, 
> is a geographical area in southeastern Europe with various geographical and historical definitions. 
> The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch throughout the whole of Bulgaria. 
> 
> The term has acquired a stigmatized and pejorative meaning related to the process of Balkanization. 
> The region may alternatively be referred to as Southeast Europe.
>
> The Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the northwest, the Ionian Sea in the southwest, 
> the Aegean Sea in the south, the Turkish straits in the east, and the Black Sea in the northeast. 
> The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined. 
> The highest point of the Balkans is Musala, 2,925 metres (9,596 ft), in the Rila mountain range, Bulgaria.
>
> The concept of the Balkan Peninsula was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808, 
> who mistakenly considered the Balkan Mountains the dominant mountain system of southeastern Europe 
> spanning from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea. 
> 
> In the 19th century the term Balkan Peninsula was a synonym for Rumelia, 
> the parts of Europe that were provinces of the Ottoman Empire at the time. 
> It had a geopolitical rather than a geographical definition, 
> which was further promoted during the creation of Yugoslavia in the early 20th century. 
> 
> The definition of the Balkan Peninsula's natural borders 
> does not coincide with the technical definition of a peninsula; 
> hence modern geographers reject the idea of a Balkan Peninsula, 
> while historical scholars usually discuss the Balkans as a region. 
> 
> The borders of the Balkans are, due to many contrasting definitions, widely disputed, 
> with no universal agreement on its components. 
> 
> By most definitions, the term fully encompasses Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, 
> Croatia (up to the Sava and Kupa rivers), mainland Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, 
> Northern Dobruja in Romania, Serbia (up to the Danube river), and East Thrace in Turkey. 
> 
> However, many definitions also include the remaining territories of Croatia, Romania and Serbia, 
> as well as Slovenia (up to the Kupa river). 
> 
> Additionally, some definitions include Hungary and Moldova due to cultural and historical factors. 
> The province of Trieste in northeastern Italy, whilst by some definitions on the geographical peninsula, 
> is generally excluded from the Balkans in a regional context.
