## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Poland**, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. 
> It is divided into 16 administrative voivodeship provinces, covering an area of 312_696km². 
> Poland has a population of over 38 million 
> and is the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union. 
> 
> [[Warsaw]] is the nation's capital and largest metropolis. 
> Other major cities include [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Poland/Provinces~Poland/Łódź,Province]], [[Poznań]], and [[Gdańsk]].
>
> Poland has a temperate transitional climate, 
> and its territory traverses the Central European Plain, 
> extending from the Baltic Sea in the north 
> to the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in the south. 
> 
> The longest Polish river is the Vistula, and Poland's highest point is Mount Rysy, 
> situated in the Tatra mountain range of the Carpathians. 
> 
> The country is bordered by Lithuania and Russia to the northeast, 
> Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, 
> and Germany to the west. 
> It also shares maritime boundaries with Denmark and Sweden.
>
> Prehistoric human activity on Polish soil dates to the Lower Paleolithic, 
> with continuous settlement since the end of the Last Glacial Period. 
> 
> Culturally diverse throughout late antiquity, 
> in the early medieval period the region became inhabited by the tribal Polans, 
> who gave Poland its name. 
> 
> The process of establishing proper statehood, which began in 966, 
> coincided with the conversion of a pagan ruler of the Polans to Christianity, 
> under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. 
> 
> The Kingdom of Poland emerged in 1025, 
> and in 1569 cemented its long-standing association with Lithuania, 
> thus forming the [[Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth]]. 
> 
> At the time, the Commonwealth was one of the great powers of Europe, 
> with a uniquely liberal political system 
> which adopted Europe's first modern constitution in 1791.
>
> With the passing of the prosperous Polish Golden Age, 
> the country was partitioned by neighboring states at the end of the 18th century. 
> 
> Poland regained its independence in 1918 as the Second Polish Republic 
> and successfully defended it in the Polish–Soviet War from 1919 to 1921. 
> 
> In September 1939, the invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union marked the 
> beginning of World War II, which resulted in the Holocaust and millions of Polish casualties. 
> 
> Forced into the Eastern Bloc in the global Cold War, 
> the Polish People's Republic was a founding signatory of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. 
> Through the emergence and contributions of the [[Solidarity movement]], 
> the communist government was dissolved 
> and Poland re-established itself as a democratic state in 1989.
>
> Poland is a parliamentary republic, 
> with its bicameral legislature comprising the Sejm and the Senate. 
> 
> It is a developed market and a high-income economy. 
> Considered a middle power, 
> Poland has the sixth-largest economy in the European Union by GDP (nominal) 
> and the fifth-largest by GDP (PPP). 
> 
> It provides a very high standard of living, safety, and economic freedom, 
> as well as free university education and a universal health care system. 
> 
> The country has 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 15 of which are cultural. 
> Poland is a founding member state of the United Nations, 
> as well as a member of the [[../../../../WikiData/WD~World Trade Organization]], [[../../../../../Knowledge/Literature/Workshop-Tactics/Ideation-Workshop/OECD]], [[../../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/NATO]], 
> and the [[../EU(European_Union)|European Union]] (including the [[../Schengen-Area]]).
