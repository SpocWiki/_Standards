> Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko (30 August 1962 or 4 December 1962 â€“ 23 November 2006) 
> was a British-naturalised Russian defector and former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) 
> who specialised in tackling organised crime. 
> 
> A prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, 
> he advised British intelligence and coined the term "mafia state". 
>
> In November 1998, Litvinenko and several other FSB officers 
> publicly accused their superiors of ordering the assassination of the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. 
> 
> Litvinenko was arrested the following March on charges of exceeding the authority of his position. 
> He was acquitted in November 1999 but re-arrested before the charges were again dismissed in 2000. 
> He fled with his family to London and was granted asylum in the United Kingdom, 
> where he worked as a journalist, writer and consultant for the British intelligence services. 
>
> During his time in London, Litvinenko wrote two books, Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within 
> and Lubyanka Criminal Group, in which he accused the Russian secret services 
> of staging the Russian apartment bombings in 1999 and other acts of terrorism 
> in an effort to bring Vladimir Putin to power. 
> He also accused Putin of ordering the assassination of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006.
>
> On 1 November 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill 
> and was hospitalised after poisoning with polonium-210; 
> he died from the poisoning on 23 November. 
> 
> The events leading up to this are well documented, 
> despite spawning numerous theories relating to his poisoning and death. 
> A British murder investigation identified Andrey Lugovoy, 
> a former member of Russia's Federal Protective Service (FSO), as the main suspect. 
> Dmitry Kovtun was later named as a second suspect. 
> 
> The United Kingdom demanded that Lugovoy be extradited; 
> Russia denied the extradition as the Russian constitution prohibits the extradition of Russian citizens, 
> leading to a straining of relations between Russia and the United Kingdom.
>
> After Litvinenko's death, his wife Marina, aided by biologist Alexander Goldfarb, 
> pursued a vigorous campaign through the Litvinenko Justice Foundation. 
> In October 2011, she won the right for an inquest into her husband's death 
> to be conducted by a coroner in London; 
> the inquest was repeatedly set back by issues relating to examinable evidence. 
> A public inquiry began on 27 January 2015, 
> and concluded in January 2016 that Litvinenko's murder was carried out by the two suspects 
> and that they were "probably" acting under the direction of the FSB 
> and with the approval of Putin and then FSB director Nikolai Patrushev. 
> 
> In the 2021 case Carter v Russia, the European Court of Human Rights ruled 
> that Russia was responsible for his death 
> and ordered the country to pay 100,000 euros in damages.
