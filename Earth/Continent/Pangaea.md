> **Pangaea** or Pangea ( pan-JEE-É™) was a supercontinent 
> that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. 
> 
> It assembled from the earlier continental units of Gondwana, Euramerica and Siberia 
> during the Carboniferous period approximately 335 million years ago, 
> and began to break apart about 200 million years ago, 
> at the end of the Triassic and beginning of the Jurassic. 
> 
> Pangaea was C-shaped, with the bulk of its mass stretching 
> between Earth's northern and southern polar regions 
> and surrounded by the superocean Panthalassa 
> and the Paleo-Tethys and subsequent Tethys Oceans. 
> 
> Pangaea is the most recent supercontinent to have existed 
> and was the first to be reconstructed by geologists.
