# [[Africa]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract  


> **Africa** is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia. 
> At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, 
> it covers 20% of Earth's land area and 6% of its total surface area. 
> 
> With nearly 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world's human population. 
> Africa's population is the youngest among all the continents; 
> the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. 
> Based on 2024 projections, Africa's population will reach 3.8 billion people by 2099. 
> 
> Africa is the least wealthy inhabited continent per capita and 
> second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania. 
> 
> Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, 
> climate, corruption, colonialism, the Cold War, and neocolonialism. 
> 
> Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion 
> and a large and young population make Africa an important economic market. 
> 
> Africa has a large quantity of natural resources and food resources, 
> including diamonds, sugar, salt, gold, iron, cobalt, uranium, copper, 
> bauxite, silver, petroleum, natural gas, cocoa beans, and tropical fruit.
>
> The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, 
> the Arabian Plate and the Gulf of Aqaba to the northeast, 
> the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. 
> 
> The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. 
> It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states, eight cities 
> and islands that are part of non-African states, 
> and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. 
> 
> This count does not include Malta and Sicily, which are geologically part of the African continent. 
> Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. 
> African nations cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, 
> which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.
>
> Africa straddles the equator and the prime meridian. 
> It is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to the southern temperate zones. 
> The majority of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, 
> with a substantial portion and a number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. 
> 
> Most of the continent lies in the tropics, 
> except for a large part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, 
> and the entire territories of Morocco and Tunisia, 
> which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. 
> 
> In the other extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, 
> great parts of South Africa, the entire territories of Lesotho and Eswatini 
> and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located 
> below the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone.
>
> Africa is highly biodiverse; it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, 
> as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. 
> However, Africa is also heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, 
> including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, and pollution. 
> 
> These entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts Africa. 
> The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Africa as 
> the continent most vulnerable to climate change.
>
> The history of Africa is long, complex, and varied, 
> and has often been under-appreciated by the global historical community. 
> In African societies the oral word is revered, and they have generally recorded their history via oral tradition, which has led anthropologists to term them oral civilisations, contrasted with literate civilisations which pride the written word.: 142–143  During the colonial period, oral sources were deprecated by European historians, which gave them the impression Africa had no recorded history. African historiography became organized at the academic level in the mid-20th century, and saw a movement towards utilising oral sources in a multidisciplinary approach, culminating in the General History of Africa, edited by specialists from across the continent.

> Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted to be the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade, also known as the great apes. The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, and Homo sapiens (modern human) are believed to have originated in Africa 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. Africa is also considered by anthropologists to be the most genetically diverse continent as a result of being the longest inhabited. In the 4th and 3rd millennia BC Ancient Egypt, Kerma, Punt, and the Tichitt Tradition emerged in North, East and West Africa, while from 4000 BC until 1000 AD the Bantu expansion was substantial in laying the foundations for societies and states in Central, East, and Southern Africa. Some African empires include Wagadu, Mali, Songhai, Sokoto, Ife, Benin, Asante, the Fatimids, Almoravids, Almohads, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Kongo, Mwene Muji, Luba, Lunda, Kitara, Aksum, Ethiopia, Adal, Ajuran, Kilwa, Sakalava, Imerina, Maravi, Mutapa, Rozvi, Mthwakazi, and Zulu. Slave trades created various diasporas, especially in the Americas. From the late 19th century to early 20th century, driven by the Second Industrial Revolution, most of Africa was rapidly conquered and colonised by European nations, save for Ethiopia and Liberia. European rule had significant impacts on Africa's societies, and colonies were maintained for the purpose of economic exploitation and extraction of natural resources. Most present states emerged from a process of decolonisation following World War II, and established the Organisation of African Unity in 1963, the predecessor to the African Union. The nascent countries decided to keep their colonial borders, with traditional power structures used in governance to varying degrees.
