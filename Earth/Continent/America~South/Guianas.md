> The **Guianas** (Guyanas or Guayanas), are a geographical region in north-eastern South America. 
> Strictly, the term refers to the three Guianas: Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, 
> formerly British, Dutch, and French Guiana respectively. 
> Broadly, it refers to the South American coast from the mouth of the Orinoco 
> to the mouth of the Amazon.
>
> Politically it is divided into:
> - Spanish or Venezuelan Guiana, now the Delta Amacuro State and Guayana Region of Venezuela.
> - Guyana, formerly British Guiana, independent since 1966.
> - Suriname, formerly Dutch Guiana, independent since 1975.
> - French Guiana, an overseas department and region of France.
> - Brazilian or Portuguese Guiana, now the Amapá State of Brazil.
>
> The three Guianas proper have a combined population of 1,718,651; 
> - Guyana: 804,567, 
> - Suriname: 612,985, and 
> - French Guiana: 301,099. 
> Most of the population is along the coast. 
> Due to the jungles to the south, the Guianas are one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth.
>
> Prior to c. 1815 there was a string of mostly Dutch settlements along the coast 
> which changed hands several times. 
> They were mostly several miles upriver to avoid the coastal marshes which were only drained later.
