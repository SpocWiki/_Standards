> The Amazon rainforest, also called the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, 
> is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome 
> that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. 
> 
> This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), 
> of which 6,000,000 km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. 
> This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 indigenous territories.
>
> The majority of the forest, 60%, is in Brazil, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, 
> and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. 
> 
> Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, 
> and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for French Guiana's protected rainforest area. 
> 
> The Amazon represents over half of the total area of remaining rainforests on Earth, 
> and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, 
> with an estimated 390 billion individual trees in about 16,000 species.
>
> More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, 
> which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 
> 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. 
> Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population, 
> and 60 of the groups remain largely isolated.
>
> Large scale deforestation is occurring in the forest, creating different harmful effects. 
> Economic losses due to deforestation in Brazil could be approximately 7 times higher 
> in comparison to the cost of all commodities produced through deforestation. 
> 
> In 2023, the World Bank published a report 
> proposing a non-deforestation based economic program in the region.
