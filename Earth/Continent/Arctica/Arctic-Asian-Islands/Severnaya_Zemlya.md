## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Severnaya Zemlya** (Russian: Северная Земля, lit. 'Northern Land', pronounced [ˈsʲevʲɪrnəjə zʲɪmˈlʲa]) 
> is a 37,000 km2 (14,000 sq mi) archipelago in the Russian high Arctic. 
> 
> It lies off Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula, separated from the mainland by the Vilkitsky Strait. 
> This archipelago separates two marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean, 
> the Kara Sea in the west and the Laptev Sea in the east.
>
> Severnaya Zemlya was first discovered in 1913 and first charted in 1930–1932, 
> making it the last sizeable archipelago on Earth to be discovered and mapped. 
> 
> Administratively, the islands form part of Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai. 
> In Soviet times there were a number of research stations in different locations, 
> but currently there are no human inhabitants in Severnaya Zemlya, 
> except for the Prima Polar Station near Cape Baranov.
>
> The largest glacier in the Russian Federation, the Academy of Sciences Glacier, 
> is located in Severnaya Zemlya. 
> 
> Until recently, ice joined the islands to Eurasia, 
> even at its smallest extent during the late summer melt season, 
> blocking the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. 
> 
> By the late summer of 2012, however, due to Arctic sea ice decline 
> the permanent ice had reached a record low extent 
> and open water appeared to the south of the archipelago.
