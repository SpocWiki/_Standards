# [[Ocean]] 

Oceans are not as well-bounded as Continents, 
because they cover a larger Globe Area than Continents. 
Additionally there is a constant water-exchange between Oceans. 
Nevertheless it makes sense to distinguish them by Name and Octant,
or better: Split the Latitude in Steps of 45° to separate the Arctic from the Tropic Part.
