> Vitus Jonassen Bering (BAIR-ing, BERR-ing, US also  BEER-ing, Danish: 
> [ˈviːtsʰus ˈjoːnæsn̩ ˈpe̝(ː)ɐ̯e̝ŋ]; baptised 5 August 1681 – 19 December 1741), 
> also known as Ivan Ivanovich Bering (Russian: Иван Иванович Беринг), 
> was a Danish-born Russian cartographer, explorer, and officer in the Russian Navy. 
> 
> He is known as a leader of two Russian expeditions, 
> - the First Kamchatka Expedition and 
> - the Great Northern Expedition, 
> exploring the northeastern coast of the Asian continent 
> and from there the western coast of the North American continent. 
> 
> The Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, Bering Island, the Bering Glacier, 
> and Vitus Lake were all named in his honor.
>
> Taking to the seas as a ship's boy at age 15, 
> Bering traveled extensively over the next eight years, 
> as well as taking naval training in Amsterdam. 
> 
> In 1704, he enrolled with the rapidly expanding navy of Tsar Peter I. 
> After serving with the navy in significant but 
> non-combat roles during the Great Northern War, Bering resigned in 1724 
> to avoid the continuing embarrassment of his low rank to his wife, 
> and upon retirement was promoted to first captain. 
> Bering was permitted to keep the rank when he rejoined the Russian Navy later that year.
>
> The tsar selected Bering to captain the First Kamchatka Expedition, 
> an expedition set to sail north from Russian outposts on the Kamchatka Peninsula, 
> with the charge to map the new areas visited 
> and establish whether Asia and America shared a land border. 
> Bering departed from Saint Petersburg in February 1725 
> as the head of a 34-man expedition, 
> aided by the expertise of Lieutenants Martin Spanberg and Aleksei Chirikov. 
> 
> The party took on men as it headed toward Okhotsk, 
> encountering many difficulties before arriving at the settlement. 
> From there, the men sailed to the Kamchatka Peninsula, 
> preparing new ships there and sailing north—
> repeating a little-documented journey of Semyon Dezhnyov 80 years earlier. 
> 
> In August 1728, Bering concluded that there was clear sea between Asia and America, 
> which he did not sight during the trip. 
> For this expedition, he was rewarded with money, prestige, 
> and a promotion to the noble rank of captain-commodore. 
> He immediately started preparations for a second trip.
>
> Having returned to Okhotsk with a much larger, better prepared, 
> and much more ambitious expedition, 
> Bering set off for an expedition to North America in 1741. 
> 
> The expedition spotted Mount Saint Elias, and sailed past Kodiak Island. 
> A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of Alaska, 
> and a landing was made at Kayak Island or in the vicinity. 
> Adverse conditions forced a return, 
> but he documented some of the Aleutian Islands on his way back. 
> 
> One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, 
> and Bering named the island group Shumagin Islands after him. 
> 
> Bering himself became too ill to command his ship, 
> which was at last driven to seek refuge on an uninhabited island 
> in the Commander Islands group in the southwest Bering Sea. 
> 
> On 19 December 1741, Bering died on the island, 
> which was given the name Bering Island after him, near the Kamchatka Peninsula, 
> reportedly from scurvy, along with 28 men of his company.
