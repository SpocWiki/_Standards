## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Portuguese Empire was a colonial empire that existed between 1415 and 1999. 
> In conjunction with the Spanish Empire, it ushered in the European Age of Discovery. 
> It achieved a global scale, controlling vast portions of the Americas, Africa 
> and various islands in Asia and Oceania. 
> 
> It was one of the most powerful empires of the early modern period, 
> while at its greatest extent in 1820, covering 5.5 million square km (2.1 million square miles), 
> making it among the largest empires in history. 
> Composed of colonies, factories, and later overseas territories, 
> it was the longest-lived colonial empire in history, 
> from the conquest of Ceuta in North Africa in 1415 to the handover of Macau to China in 1999.
>
> The power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe. In the wake of the Reconquista, Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418–1419, using recent developments in navigation, cartography, and maritime technology such as the caravel, with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice trade. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Agulhas, and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India. In 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral, while on a voyage to India, reached what would later be Brazil.
>
> Over the following decades, Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia, establishing forts and factories as they went. By 1571, a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki along the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This commercial network and the colonial trade had a substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth (1500–1800) when it accounted for about a fifth of Portugal's per-capita income.
>
> When King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal) seized the Portuguese crown and Portuguese territories such as Brazil in 1580, there began a 60-year union between Spain and Portugal known to subsequent historiography as the Iberian Union, although the realms continued to have separate administrations. As the King of Spain was also King of Portugal, Portuguese colonies became the subject of attacks by three rival European powers hostile to Spain: the Dutch Republic, England, and France. With its smaller population, Portugal found itself unable to effectively defend its overstretched network of trading posts, and the empire began a long and gradual decline. Eventually, Brazil became the most valuable colony of the second era of empire (1663–1825), until, as part of the wave of independence movements that swept the Americas during the early 19th century, it declared its independence in 1822.
>
> The third era of empire covers the final stage of Portuguese colonialism after the independence of Brazil in the 1820s. By then, the colonial possessions had been reduced to forts and plantations along the African coastline (expanded inland during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century), Portuguese Timor, and enclaves in India and Macau. The 1890 British Ultimatum led to the contraction of Portuguese ambitions in Africa.
>
> Under António de Oliveira Salazar (in office 1932–1968), the Estado Novo dictatorship made some ill-fated attempts to cling on to its last remaining colonies. Under the ideology of pluricontinentalism, the regime renamed its colonies "overseas provinces" while retaining the system of forced labour, from which only a small indigenous élite was normally exempt. In August 1961, the Dahomey annexed the Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá, and in December that year India annexed Goa, Daman, and Diu. The Portuguese Colonial War in Africa lasted from 1961 until the final overthrow of the Estado Novo regime in 1974. The Carnation Revolution of April 1974 in Lisbon led to the hasty decolonisation of Portuguese Africa and to the 1975 annexation of Portuguese Timor by Indonesia. Decolonisation prompted an exodus of Portuguese colonial settlers and mixed-race people from the colonies. Portugal returned Macau to China in 1999. The only overseas possessions to remain under Portuguese rule, the Azores and Madeira, whose native inhabitants were overwhelmingly Portuguese, had their constitutional status changed from "overseas provinces" to "autonomous regions". The Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) is the cultural successor of the Empire, analogous to the Commonwealth of Nations for countries formerly part of the British Empire.
