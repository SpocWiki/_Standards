> Leif Erikson, also known as Leif the Lucky (c. 970s – c. 1018 to 1025), 
> was a Norse explorer who is thought to have been 
> the first European to set foot on continental America, 
> approximately half a millennium before Christopher Columbus. 
> 
> According to the sagas of Icelanders, he established a Norse settlement 
> at Vinland, which is usually interpreted as being coastal North America. 
> 
> There is ongoing speculation that the settlement made by Leif and his crew 
> corresponds to the remains of a Norse settlement found in Newfoundland, 
> Canada, called L'Anse aux Meadows, which was occupied approximately 1,000 years ago.
>
> Leif's place of birth is unknown, although it is assumed to have been in Iceland. 
> His father, Erik the Red, founded the first Norse settlement in Greenland, 
> where Leif was later raised. 
> 
> Following his voyage to Vinland and the subsequent death of his father, 
> Leif became chief of the Greenland settlement. 
> He had two known sons: 
> - Thorgils, born in the Hebrides; and 
> - Thorkell, who succeeded him as Greenland's chieftain.
