> **Ozone** (or trioxygen) is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O3. 
> It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. 
> It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O2, 
> breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O2 (dioxygen). 
> 
> Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light 
> and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. 
> 
> It is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere, 
> with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, 
> which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
>
> Ozone's odor is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air. 
> Ozone's O3 structure was determined in 1865. 
> The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be weakly diamagnetic. 
> 
> In standard conditions, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid 
> and finally a violet-black solid. 
> 
> Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that 
> both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures, physical shock, 
> or fast warming to the boiling point. It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.
>
> Ozone is a powerful oxidant (far more so than dioxygen) 
> and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. 
> 
> This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, 
> and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. 
> 
> While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, 
> a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, 
> preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.
