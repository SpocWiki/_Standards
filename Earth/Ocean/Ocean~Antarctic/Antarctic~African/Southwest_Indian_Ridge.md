> The Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a mid-ocean ridge 
> located along the floors of the south-west Indian Ocean and south-east Atlantic Ocean.  
> 
> A divergent tectonic plate boundary separating the Somali plate to the north 
> from the Antarctic plate to the south, the SWIR is characterised by ultra-slow spreading rates 
> (only exceeding those of the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic) 
> combined with a fast lengthening of its axis between the two flanking triple junctions, 
> - Rodrigues (20°30′S 70°00′E) in the Indian Ocean and 
> - Bouvet (54°17′S 1°5′W) in the Atlantic Ocean.
