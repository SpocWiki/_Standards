> The Laptev Sea is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. 
> It is located between the northern coast of Siberia, the Taimyr Peninsula, 
> Severnaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian Islands. 
> 
> Its northern boundary passes from the Arctic Cape 
> to a point with co-ordinates of 79°N and 139°E, and ends at the Anisiy Cape. 
> The Kara Sea lies to the west, the East Siberian Sea to the east.
>
> The sea is named after Russian explorers Dmitry Laptev and Khariton Laptev; 
> formerly, it had been known under various names, the last being Nordenskiöld Sea 
> (Russian: мо́ре Норденшёльда), after explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. 
> 
> The sea has a severe climate with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) for more than nine months per year; 
> low water salinity; scarcity of flora, fauna, and human population; 
> and shallow depths (mostly less than 50 meters). 
> It is frozen most of the time, though generally clear in August and September.
>
> The sea shores were inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous tribes of Yukaghirs 
> and then Evens and Evenks, which were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. 
> 
> They were then settled by Yakuts and later by Russians. 
> Russian explorations of the area started in the 17th century. 
> They came from the south via several large rivers which empty into the sea, 
> such as the prominent Lena River, the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok, the Omoloy and the Yana. 
> The sea contains several dozen islands, many of which contain well-preserved mammoth remains.
