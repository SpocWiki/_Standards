> The Barents Sea ( BARR-ənts, also US:  BAR-ənts; 
> Norwegian: Barentshavet, Urban East Norwegian: [ˈbɑ̀ːrəntsˌhɑːvə]; 
> Russian: Баренцево море, romanized: Barentsevo More) 
> is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located off the northern coasts of Norway and Russia 
> and divided between Norwegian and Russian territorial waters. 
> 
> It was known earlier among Russians as the Northern Sea, Pomorsky Sea 
> or Murman Sea ("Norse Sea"); 
> the current name of the sea is after the historical Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz.
>
> The Barents Sea is a rather shallow shelf sea with an average depth of 230 metres (750 ft), 
> and it is an important site for both fishing and hydrocarbon exploration. 
> It is bordered by the Kola Peninsula to the south, 
> the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea to the west, 
> the archipelagos of Svalbard to the northwest, Franz Josef Land to the northeast 
> and Novaya Zemlya to the east. 
> The islands of Novaya Zemlya, an extension of the northern end of the Ural Mountains, 
> separate the Barents Sea from the Kara Sea.
>
> Although part of the Arctic Ocean, 
> the Barents Sea has been characterised as "turning into the Atlantic" 
> or in the process of being "Atlantified" 
> because of its status as "the Arctic warming hot spot." 
> 
> Hydrologic changes due to global warming have led to a reduction in sea ice 
> and in the stratification of the water column, 
> which could produce major changes in weather in Eurasia. 
> 
> One prediction is that, as the Barents Sea's permanent ice-free area grows, 
> evaporation will increase, leading to increased winter snowfalls in much of continental Europe.
