> A mid-ocean ridge (MOR) is a seafloor mountain system formed by plate tectonics. 
> It typically has a depth of about 2,600 meters (8,500 ft) and rises about 2,000 meters (6,600 ft) 
> above the deepest portion of an ocean basin. 
> 
> This feature is where seafloor spreading takes place along a divergent plate boundary. 
> The rate of seafloor spreading determines the morphology of the crest of the mid-ocean ridge 
> and its width in an ocean basin.
>
> The production of new seafloor and oceanic lithosphere 
> results from mantle upwelling in response to plate separation. 
> The melt rises as magma at the linear weakness between the separating plates, 
> and emerges as lava, creating new oceanic crust and lithosphere upon cooling.
>
> The first discovered mid-ocean ridge was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 
> which is a spreading center that bisects the North and South Atlantic basins; 
> hence the origin of the name 'mid-ocean ridge'. 
> 
> Most oceanic spreading centers are not in the middle of their hosting ocean basis 
> but regardless, are traditionally called mid-ocean ridges. 
>
> Mid-ocean ridges around the globe are linked by plate tectonic boundaries 
> and the trace of the ridges across the ocean floor appears similar to the seam of a baseball. 
> 
> Most mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form the Ocean Ridge, 
> a global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, 
> making it the longest mountain range in the world. 
> 
> The continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,400 mi) long 
> (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range), 
> and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is 80,000 km (49,700 mi) long.
