> **Tide**s are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the 
> gravitational forces exerted by the Moon (and to a much lesser extent, the Sun) 
> and are also caused by the Earth and Moon orbiting one another.
>
> Tide tables can be used for any given locale 
> to find the predicted times and amplitude (or "tidal range"). 
>
> The predictions are influenced by many factors including the 
> - alignment of the Sun and Moon, 
> - the phase and amplitude of the tide (pattern of tides in the deep ocean), 
> - the amphidromic systems of the oceans, and 
> - the shape of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry (see Timing). 
> They are however only predictions, and the actual time and height of the tide 
> is affected by wind and atmospheric pressure. 
> 
> Many shorelines experience semi-diurnal tides—
> two nearly equal high and low tides each day. 
> 
> Other locations have a diurnal tide—one high and low tide each day. 
> A "mixed tide"—two uneven magnitude tides a day—is a third regular category.
>
> Tides vary on timescales ranging from hours to years 
> due to a number of factors, which determine the lunitidal interval. 
> 
> To make accurate records, tide gauges at fixed stations measure water level over time. 
> Gauges ignore variations caused by waves with periods shorter than minutes. 
> These data are compared to the reference (or datum) level usually called mean sea level.
>
> While tides are usually the largest source of short-term sea-level fluctuations, 
> sea levels are also subject to change from thermal expansion, 
> wind, and barometric pressure changes, resulting in storm surges, 
> especially in shallow seas and near coasts.
>
> Tidal phenomena are not limited to the oceans, but can occur in other systems 
> whenever a gravitational field that varies in time and space is present. 
> 
> For example, the shape of the solid part of the Earth is affected slightly by Earth tide, 
> though this is not as easily seen as the water tidal movements.
