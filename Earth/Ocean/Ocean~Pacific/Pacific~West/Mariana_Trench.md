> The Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the western Pacific Ocean, 
> about 200 kilometres (124 mi) east of the Mariana Islands; 
> it is the deepest oceanic trench on Earth. 
> 
> It is crescent-shaped and measures about 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length 
> and 69 km (43 mi) in width. 
> 
> The maximum known depth is 10,984 ± 25 metres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms; 6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-shaped valley in its floor 
> known as the Challenger Deep. 
> The deepest point of the trench is more than 2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level 
> than the peak of Mount Everest.
>
> At the bottom of the trench at around 11,000 metres below the sea surface, 
> the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), 
> approximately 1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level 
> or eight tons per square inch.
>
> The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34 to 39 °F).
>
> In 2009, the Mariana Trench was established as a US National Monument, 
> Mariana Trench Marine National Monument.
>
> One-celled organisms called monothalamea have been found in the trench 
> at a record depth of 10.6 km (35,000 ft; 6.6 mi) below the sea surface 
> by researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
> 
> Data has also suggested that microbial life forms thrive within the trench.
