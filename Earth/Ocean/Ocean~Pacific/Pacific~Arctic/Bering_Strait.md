> The **Bering Strait** ( BAIR-ing, BERR-ing, US also  BEER-ing; Russian: Берингов пролив, 
> romanized: Beringov proliv) is a strait between the Pacific and Arctic oceans, 
> separating the Chukchi Peninsula of the Russian Far East 
> from the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. 
> 
> The present Russia–United States maritime boundary is at 168° 58' 37" W longitude, 
> slightly south of the Arctic Circle at about 65° 40' N latitude. 
> The Strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born Russian explorer.
>
> The Bering Strait has been the subject of 
> the scientific theory that humans migrated from Asia to North America 
> across a land bridge known as Beringia when lower ocean levels – 
> a result of glaciers locking up vast amounts of water – 
> exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor, 
> both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it. 
> 
> This view of how Paleo-Indians entered America 
> has been the dominant one for several decades and continues to be the most accepted one. 
> Numerous successful crossings without the use of a boat 
> have also been recorded since at least the early 20th century.
