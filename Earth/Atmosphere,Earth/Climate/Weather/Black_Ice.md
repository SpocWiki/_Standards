## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Black ice, sometimes called clear ice, is a coating of glaze ice on a surface, 
> for example on streets or on lakes. 
> 
> The ice itself is not black, but visually transparent, 
> allowing the often black road below to be seen through it and light to be transmitted. 
> The typically low levels of noticeable ice pellets, snow, or sleet surrounding black ice 
> means that areas of the ice are often next to invisible to drivers, cyclists or people walking on it. 
> Thus, there is a risk of slippage and subsequent accident due to the unexpected loss of traction.
