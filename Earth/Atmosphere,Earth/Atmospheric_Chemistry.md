> Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science 
> that studies the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets. 
> 
> This multidisciplinary approach of research draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology, climatology 
> and other disciplines to understand both natural and human-induced changes in atmospheric composition. 
> 
> Key areas of research include the behavior of trace gasses, 
> the formation of pollutants, and the role of aerosols and greenhouse gasses. 
> 
> Through a combination of observations, laboratory experiments, and computer modeling, 
> atmospheric chemists investigate the causes and consequences of atmospheric changes.
