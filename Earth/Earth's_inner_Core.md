## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Earth's inner core is the innermost geologic layer of the planet Earth. 
> It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,230 km (760 mi), 
> which is about 20% of Earth's radius or 70% of the Moon's radius.
>
> There are no samples of the core accessible for direct measurement, 
> as there are for Earth's mantle. 
> 
> The characteristics of the core have been deduced mostly 
> from measurements of seismic waves and Earth's magnetic field. 
> 
> The inner core is believed to be composed of an iron–nickel alloy with some other elements. 
> The temperature at its surface is estimated to be approximately 5,700 K (5,430 °C; 9,800 °F), 
> about the temperature at the surface of the Sun.
>
> The inner core is solid at high temperature because of its high pressure, 
> in accordance with the [[Simon-Glatzel Equation]].
