> The **Moon** is Earth's only natural satellite. 
> It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. 
> Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, 
> causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. 
> Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth days. 
> The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the Sun's – are the main drivers of Earth's tides.
>
> In geophysical terms the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. 
> Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), 
> roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as Australia.) 
> Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its parent planet, 
> the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, 
> and larger and more massive than all known dwarf planets. 
> Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, 
> and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. 
> 
> The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, 
> with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. 
> It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, 
> out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth 
> and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.
>
> The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, 
> impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, 
> by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of cooled magma. 
> These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. 
> 
> The Moon is, except when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, 
> always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, 
> producing the lunar phases. 
> The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. 
> This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, 
> while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. 
> The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, 
> allowing it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse. 
> From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time 
> due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.
>
> The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans, 
> having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. 
> 
> On September 13, 1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body 
> arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. 
> In 1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body 
> where soft landings and orbital insertions were achieved. 
> On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, 
> at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. 
> Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. 
> The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. 
> 
> Since then, exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, 
> and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.
