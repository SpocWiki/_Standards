> Exploration is the process of exploring, 
> an activity which has some expectation of discovery. 
> 
> Organised exploration is largely a human activity, 
> but exploratory activity is common to most organisms capable of directed locomotion 
> and the ability to learn, and has been described in, amongst others, 
> social insects foraging behaviour, where feedback from returning individuals 
> affects the activity of other members of the group.
