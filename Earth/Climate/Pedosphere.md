> The **Pedosphere** (from Ancient Greek  πέδον (pédon) 'ground, earth' 
> and  σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'sphere') is the outermost layer of the Earth 
> that is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. 
> 
> It exists at the interface of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. 
> The pedosphere is the skin of the Earth 
> and only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between the 
> - atmosphere (air in and above the soil), 
> - biosphere (living organisms), 
> - lithosphere (unconsolidated regolith and consolidated bedrock) and the 
> - hydrosphere (water in, on and below the soil). 
> The pedosphere is the foundation of terrestrial life on Earth.

> The pedosphere acts as the mediator of chemical and biogeochemical flux into and out of these respective systems and is made up of gaseous, mineralic, fluid and biologic components. The pedosphere lies within the Critical Zone, a broader interface that includes vegetation, pedosphere, aquifer systems, regolith and finally ends at some depth in the bedrock where the biosphere and hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to the chemistry at depth. As part of the larger global system, any particular environment in which soil forms is influenced solely by its geographic position on the globe as climatic, geologic, biologic and anthropogenic changes occur with changes in longitude and latitude.

> The pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without the aid of biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions, where it forms a soil carbon sponge. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants, but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile, causing ion exchange between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.
