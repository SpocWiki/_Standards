## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Wind engineering is a subset of mechanical engineering, structural engineering, 
> meteorology, and applied physics that analyzes the 
> effects of wind in the natural and the built environment 
> and studies the possible damage, inconvenience or benefits which may result from wind. 
> 
> In the field of engineering it includes strong winds, which may cause discomfort, 
> as well as extreme winds, such as in a tornado, hurricane or heavy storm, 
> which may cause widespread destruction. 
> 
> In the fields of wind energy and air pollution it also includes low and moderate winds 
> as these are relevant to electricity production and dispersion of contaminants.
>
> Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, fluid dynamics, mechanics, geographic information systems, and a number of specialist engineering disciplines, including aerodynamics and structural dynamics. The tools used include atmospheric models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels, and computational fluid dynamics models.
>
> Wind engineering involves, among other topics:
> - Wind impact on structures (buildings, bridges, towers)
> - Wind comfort near buildings
> - Effects of wind on the ventilation system in a building
> - Wind climate for wind energy
> - Air pollution near buildings
>
> Wind engineering may be considered by structural engineers to be 
> closely related to earthquake engineering and explosion protection.
>
> Some sports stadiums such as Candlestick Park and Arthur Ashe Stadium 
> are known for their strong, sometimes swirly winds, which affect the playing conditions.
