> A dust storm, also called a sandstorm, 
> is a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions. 
> 
> Dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind 
> blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface. 
> 
> Fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension, 
> a process that moves soil from one place and deposits it in another. 
> 
> These storms can reduce visibility, disrupt transportation, and pose serious health risks. 
> Over time, repeated dust storms can reduce agricultural productivity 
> and contribute to desertification. 
>
> The arid regions of North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and China 
> are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust. 
> 
> It has been argued that poor management of Earth's drylands, 
> such as neglecting the [[../../../Society/Economics/Industry/Agriculture/Crop/Crop_Rotation/Fallow|Fallow]] system, 
> are increasing the size and frequency of dust storms from desert margins 
> and changing both the local and global climate, as well as impacting local economies.
>
> The term sandstorm is used most often in the context of desert dust storms, 
> especially in the Sahara Desert, 
> or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock, 
> when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, 
> a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface. 
> 
> The term dust storm is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances, 
> especially when the dust storm affects urban areas.
