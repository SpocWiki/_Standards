> A **Thunderstorm**, also known as an electrical storm or a lightning storm, 
> is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and thunder. 
> 
> Relatively weak thunderstorms are sometimes called thundershowers. 
> 
> Thunderstorms occur in cumulonimbus clouds. 
> They are usually accompanied by strong winds 
> and often produce heavy rain and sometimes snow, sleet, or hail, 
> but some thunderstorms can produce little or no precipitation at all. 
> 
> Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. 
> Strong or severe thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, 
> including large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. 
> 
> Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. 
> 
> While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow 
> through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, 
> vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course 
> at a right angle to the wind shear direction.
>
> Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm, moist air, 
> sometimes along a front. 
> 
> However, some kind of cloud forcing, whether it is a front, shortwave trough, or another system 
> is needed for the air to rapidly accelerate upward. 
> 
> As the warm, moist air moves upward, it cools, condenses, and forms a cumulonimbus cloud 
> that can reach heights of over 20 kilometres (12 mi). 
> 
> As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature, 
> water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice, 
> reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell. 
> 
> Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth's surface. 
> As the droplets fall, they collide with other droplets and become larger. 
> The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it, 
> and this cold air spreads out at the Earth's surface, 
> occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms.
>
> Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location 
> but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes 
> collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. 
> 
> Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of 
> many severe weather phenomena, which can be potentially hazardous. 
> 
> Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, 
> large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. 
> 
> Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.
>
> There are three types of thunderstorms: single-cell, multi-cell, and supercell. 
> 
> Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. 
> 
> Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear 
> within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes. 
> 
> Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires 
> from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. 
> 
> Several means are used to study thunderstorms: 
> - weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. 
> 
> Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development 
> as late as the 18th century. 
> 
> Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been 
> observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.
