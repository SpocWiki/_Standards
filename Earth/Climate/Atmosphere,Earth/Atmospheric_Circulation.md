> Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air 
> and together with ocean circulation is the means by which 
> thermal energy is redistributed on the surface of Earth. 
> 
> Earth's atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, 
> but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant. 
> The smaller-scale weather systems – mid-latitude depressions, 
> or tropical convective cells – occur chaotically, 
> and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, 
> or a month in theory (see chaos theory and the butterfly effect).
>
> Earth's weather is a consequence of its illumination by the Sun 
> and the laws of thermodynamics. 
> 
> The atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun's energy 
> and whose energy sink, ultimately, is the blackness of space. 
> The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air, 
> and in that process it redistributes the energy absorbed by Earth's surface 
> near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and thence to space.
>
> The large-scale atmospheric circulation "cells" shift polewards in warmer periods 
> (for example, interglacials compared to glacials), but remain largely constant 
> as they are, fundamentally, a property of Earth's size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little. 
> 
> Over very long time periods (hundreds of millions of years), 
> a tectonic uplift can significantly alter their major elements, 
> such as the jet stream, and plate tectonics may shift ocean currents. 
> 
> During the extremely hot climates of the [[../../../Time-Ages/geo~Eons/Eon~4~Phanerozoic/Era~2~Mesozoic|Era~2~Mesozoic]] , 
> a third desert belt may have existed at the Equator.
