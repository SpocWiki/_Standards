> The trade winds, or easterlies, 
> are permanent east-to-west prevailing winds that flow in Earth's equatorial region. 
> 
> The trade winds blow mainly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere 
> and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, 
> strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase. 
> 
> Trade winds have been used for centuries by captains of sailing ships 
> to cross the world's oceans . 
> They enabled European colonization of the Americas, 
> and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.
>
> In meteorology, they act as the steering flow for tropical storms 
> that form over the Atlantic, Pacific, and southern Indian oceans 
> and cause rainfall in East Africa, Madagascar, North America, and Southeast Asia. 
> 
> Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes 
> and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion, 
> which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge. 
> The weaker the trade winds become, 
> the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses.
>
> The trade winds also transport nitrate- and phosphate-rich Saharan dust 
> to all Latin America, the Caribbean Sea, 
> and to parts of southeastern and southwestern North America. 
> Sahara dust is on occasion present in sunsets across Florida. 
> 
> When dust from the Sahara travels over land, rainfall is suppressed 
> and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance 
> which leads to an increase in red sunsets. 
> 
> Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates.
