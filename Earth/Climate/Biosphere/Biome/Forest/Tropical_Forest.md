## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Tropical forests are forested ecoregions with tropical climates – 
> that is, land areas approximately bounded by the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, 
> but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.
>
> Some tropical forest types are difficult to categorize. 
> While forests in temperate areas are readily categorized on the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests. There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere. Because of these difficulties, information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources. However, tropical forests are extensive, making up just under half the world's forests. The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world's forests (45 percent), followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.
>
> More than 3.6 million hectares of virgin tropical forest was lost in 2018.
