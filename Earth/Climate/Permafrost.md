## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Permafrost** (from perma- 'permanent' and  frost) is soil or underwater sediment 
> which continuously remains below 0 °C (32 °F) for two years or more; 
> the oldest permafrost has been continuously frozen for around 700,000 years. 
> 
> Whilst the shallowest permafrost has a vertical extent of below a meter (3 ft), 
> the deepest is greater than 1,500 m (4,900 ft). 
> 
> Similarly, the area of individual permafrost zones may be limited to narrow mountain summits 
> or extend across vast Arctic regions. 
> 
> The ground beneath glaciers and ice sheets is not usually defined as permafrost, 
> so on land, permafrost is generally located beneath a so-called active layer of soil 
> which freezes and thaws depending on the season.
>
> Around 15% of the Northern Hemisphere or 11% of the global surface is underlain by permafrost, 
> covering a total area of around 18 million km2 (6.9 million sq mi). 
> 
> This includes large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. 
> It is also located in high mountain regions, with the Tibetan Plateau being a prominent example. 
> Only a minority of permafrost exists in the Southern Hemisphere, 
> where it is consigned to mountain slopes like in the Andes of Patagonia, 
> the Southern Alps of New Zealand, or the highest mountains of Antarctica.
>
> Permafrost contains large amounts of dead biomass that has accumulated throughout millennia 
> without having had the chance to fully decompose and release its carbon, 
> making tundra soil a carbon sink. 
> 
> As global warming heats the ecosystem, frozen soil thaws 
> and becomes warm enough for decomposition to start anew, 
> accelerating the permafrost carbon cycle. 
> 
> Depending on conditions at the time of thaw, 
> decomposition can release either carbon dioxide or methane, 
> and these greenhouse gas emissions act as a climate change feedback. 
> 
> The emissions from thawing permafrost will have a sufficient impact on the climate 
> to impact global carbon budgets. 
> 
> It is difficult to accurately predict how much greenhouse gases the permafrost releases 
> because the different thaw processes are still uncertain. 
> 
> There is widespread agreement that the emissions will be smaller than human-caused emissions 
> and not large enough to result in runaway warming. 
> Instead, the annual permafrost emissions are likely 
> comparable with global emissions from deforestation, 
> or to annual emissions of large countries such as Russia, the United States or China.
>
> Apart from its climate impact, permafrost thaw brings more risks. 
> 
> Formerly frozen ground often contains enough ice that when it thaws, 
> hydraulic saturation is suddenly exceeded, so the ground shifts substantially 
> and may even collapse outright. 
> 
> Many buildings and other infrastructure were built on permafrost when it was frozen and stable, 
> and so are vulnerable to collapse if it thaws. 
> 
> Estimates suggest nearly 70% of such infrastructure is at risk by 2050, 
> and that the associated costs could rise to tens of billions of dollars in the second half of the century. 
> 
> Furthermore, between 13,000 and 20,000 sites contaminated with toxic waste 
> are present in the permafrost, as well as natural mercury deposits, 
> which are all liable to leak and pollute the environment as the warming progresses. 
> 
> Lastly, concerns have been raised about the potential for pathogenic microorganisms 
> surviving the thaw and contributing to future pandemics. 
> 
> However, this is considered unlikely, 
> and a scientific review on the subject describes the risks as "generally low".
