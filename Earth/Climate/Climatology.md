> **Climatology** (from Greek κλίμα, klima, "slope"; and -λογία, -logia) or climate science 
> is the scientific study of Earth's climate, 
> typically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of at least 30 years. 
> 
> Climate concerns the atmospheric condition during an extended to indefinite period of time; 
> weather is the condition of the atmosphere during a relative brief period of time. 
> The main topics of research are the study of climate variability, 
> mechanisms of climate changes and modern climate change. 
> 
> This topic of study is regarded as part of the atmospheric sciences 
> and a subdivision of physical geography, which is one of the Earth sciences. 
> Climatology includes some aspects of oceanography and biogeochemistry.
>
> The main methods employed by climatologists are the analysis of observations and modelling of the physical processes that determine climate. Short term weather forecasting can be interpreted in terms of knowledge of longer-term phenomena of climate, for instance climatic cycles such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Arctic oscillation (AO), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Climate models are used for a variety of purposes from studying the dynamics of the weather and climate system to predictions of future climate.
