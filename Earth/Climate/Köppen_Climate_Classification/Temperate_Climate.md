> In geography, the temperate climates of Earth occur in the middle latitudes 
> (approximately 23.5° to 66.5° N/S of the Equator), 
> which span between the tropics and the polar regions of Earth. 
> 
> These zones generally have wider temperature ranges throughout the year 
> and more distinct seasonal changes compared to tropical climates, 
> where such variations are often small; they usually differ only in the amount of precipitation.
>
> In temperate climates, not only do latitudinal positions influence temperature changes, 
> but various sea currents, prevailing wind direction, continentality (how large a landmass is) 
> and altitude also shape temperate climates.
>
> The Köppen climate classification defines a climate as "temperate" C, 
> when the mean temperature is above −3 °C (26.6 °F) but below 18 °C (64.4 °F) in the coldest month to account for the persistence of frost. 
> 
> However, some adaptations of Köppen set the minimum at 0 °C (32.0 °F). 
> Continental climates are classified as D and considered to be varieties of temperate climates, having more extreme temperatures, with mean temperatures in the coldest month usually being below −3 °C (26.6 °F).
