> Tropical climate is the first of the five major climate groups in the Köppen climate classification 
> identified with the letter A. 
> 
> Tropical climates are defined by a monthly average temperature of 
> 18 °C (64 °F) or higher in the coolest month, 
> featuring hot temperatures and high humidity all year-round. 
> 
> Annual precipitation is often abundant in tropical climates, 
> and shows a seasonal rhythm but may have seasonal dryness to varying degrees. 
> 
> There are normally only two seasons in tropical climates, 
> a wet (rainy/monsoon) season and a dry season. 
> 
> The annual temperature range in tropical climates is normally very small. 
> Sunlight is intense in these climates.
>
> There are three basic types of tropical climates within the tropical climate group: 
> - tropical rainforest climate (Af), 
> - tropical monsoon climate (Am) and 
> - tropical savanna or tropical wet and dry climate (Aw for dry winters, and As for dry summers), 
> which are classified and distinguished by the precipitation levels of the driest month in those regions.
