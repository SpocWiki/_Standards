> **Slate** is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic rock 
> derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock 
> composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade, regional metamorphism. 
> 
> It is the finest-grained foliated metamorphic rock. 
> Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, 
> but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.

> The foliation in slate, called "slaty cleavage", is caused by strong compression in which fine-grained clay forms flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression. When expertly "cut" by striking parallel to the foliation with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates display a property called fissility, forming smooth, flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing, floor tiles, and billiard tables. Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen en masse covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from North Wales can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green, or cyan. Slate is not to be confused with shale, from which it may be formed, or schist.

> The word "slate" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a writing slate, which was traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases "clean slate" and "blank slate" come from this usage.
