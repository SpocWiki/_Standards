## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Carnival** (known as Shrovetide in certain localities) is a festive season 
> that occurs at the close of the Christian pre-Lenten period, 
> consisting of Quinquagesima or Shrove Sunday, Shrove Monday, and Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras.
>
> Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, 
> public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus. 
> 
> Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality 
> and experience a heightened sense of social unity. 
> Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, 
> and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent. 
> 
> Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed "excessively", 
> rather, their stock was fully consumed during Shrovetide as to reduce waste. 
> This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent 
> (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, 
> and various other activities of indulgence being performed. 
> 
> For example, pancakes, donuts, and other desserts are prepared and eaten for a final time. 
> During Lent, dairy and animal products are eaten less, if at all, 
> and individuals make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object of desire (e.g. sweets), 
> with the money that would go to purchase what was sacrificed 
> being donated at the church as alms for the poor.
>
> As such, during the season of Shrovetide, 
> it is customary for Christians to ponder what Lenten sacrifices they will make for the coming Lent. 
> The traditions of carrying Shrovetide rods 
> and consuming Shrovetide buns after attending church are celebrated. 
> On the final day of the season, Shrove Tuesday, 
> many traditional Christians, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, and Roman Catholics, 
> "make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, 
> and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to 
> ask God's help in dealing with." 
> 
> During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex 
> to collect the previous year's Holy Week palm branches 
> that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies. 
> On Shrove Tuesday (the final day of Shrovetide), churches burn these palms 
> to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.
>
> The term "Carnival" is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece. 
> The celebration is known as Fastelavn in historically Evangelical Lutheran countries. 
> It is called Shrovetide in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans 
> (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants. 
> In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. 
> In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, 
> the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). 
> This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season 
> or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.
