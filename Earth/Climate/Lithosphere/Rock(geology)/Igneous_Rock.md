> Igneous rock (igneous from Latin  igneus 'fiery'), or magmatic rock, 
> is one of the three main rock types, the others being [[../../../../WikiData/WD~Sedimentary_rock,82480|WD~Sedimentary_rock,82480]] and [[../../../../WikiData/WD~Metamorphic_rock,47069|WD~Metamorphic_rock,47069]]. 
> Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.
>
> The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in a terrestrial planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.
>
> Igneous rocks occur in a wide range of geological settings: shields, platforms, orogens, basins, large igneous provinces, extended crust and oceanic crust.
