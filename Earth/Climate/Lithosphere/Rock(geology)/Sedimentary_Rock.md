> Sedimentary rocks are types of rock formed by the cementation of sediments—
> i.e. particles made of minerals (geological detritus) or organic matter (biological detritus)—
> that have been accumulated or deposited at Earth's surface. 
> 
> Sedimentation is any process that causes these particles to settle in place. 
> Geological detritus originates from weathering and erosion of existing rocks, 
> or from the solidification of molten lava blobs erupted by volcanoes. 
> 
> The geological detritus is transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice 
> or mass movement, which are called agents of denudation. 
> Biological detritus is formed by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, 
> as well as their fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water bodies (marine snow). 
> 
> Sedimentation may also occur when dissolved minerals precipitate from water solution.
>
> The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth's crust is extensive (73% of land surface), 
> but sedimentary rock is estimated to be only 8% of the volume of the crust. 
> 
> Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer 
> over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks. 
> 
> Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding. 
> Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in large structures called sedimentary basins. 
> 
> Sedimentary rocks have also been found on Mars.
>
> The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals or other structures. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources including coal, fossil fuels, drinking water and ores.
>
> The study of the sequence of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for an understanding of the Earth's history, including palaeogeography, paleoclimatology and the history of life. The scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology. Sedimentology is part of both geology and physical geography and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the Earth sciences, such as pedology, geomorphology, geochemistry and structural geology.
