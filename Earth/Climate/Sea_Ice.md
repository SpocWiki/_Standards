> Sea ice forms as seawater freezes. 
> Because ice is less dense than water, it floats on the ocean's surface (just like fresh water ice). 
> Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans. 
> Much of the world's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth's polar regions: 
> the Arctic ice pack of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice pack of the Southern Ocean. 
> Polar packs naturally undergo significant yearly cycling, 
> reaching their greatest surface extent in winter and retreating in summer.
>
> Within the ice, salty brine channels provide habitat for microorganisms 
> that form the base of unique food webs. 
> 
> The presence or absence of sea ice also shapes navigation routes, regional weather, 
> and global ocean circulation. 
> 
> Sea ice plays a key role in Earth's climate. 
> Its white surface reflects the Sun's energy back into space, 
> helping to keep the planet cool in a process known as the albedo effect. 
> 
> Sea ice also insulates the ocean below, limiting the transfer of heat, water vapor, 
> and gases such as carbon dioxide between the sea and the atmosphere.
>
> Satellite records have shown a marked decline in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness 
> in recent decades, a trend linked to global climate change. 
> Antarctic sea ice shows more regional variability but is recently also experiencing declines.
>
> Sea ice is dynamic, due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, 
> which lead to a wide variety of ice types and features. 
> 
> Sea ice differs from icebergs, 
> which are chunks of ice shelves or glaciers that calve into the ocean. 
> Depending on location, sea ice may contain embedded icebergs.
