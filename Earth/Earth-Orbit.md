> In celestial mechanics, an **Orbit** (also known as orbital revolution) 
> is the curved trajectory of an object such as the trajectory of a planet around a star, 
> or of a natural satellite around a planet, or of an artificial satellite 
> around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. 
> 
> Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, 
> although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. 
> 
> To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, 
> with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, 
> as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
>
> For most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, 
> which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. 
> 
> However, Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, 
> which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics, 
> provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion.
