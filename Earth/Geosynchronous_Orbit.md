> A geosynchronous orbit (sometimes abbreviated GSO) is an Earth-centered orbit 
> with an orbital period that matches Earth's rotation on its axis, 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds 
> (one sidereal day). 
> 
> The synchronization of rotation and orbital period means that, for an observer on Earth's surface, 
> an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to exactly the same position in the sky 
> after a period of one sidereal day. 
> 
> Over the course of a day, the object's position in the sky may remain still or trace out a path, 
> typically in a figure-8 form, 
> whose precise characteristics depend on the orbit's inclination and eccentricity. 
> A circular geosynchronous orbit has a constant altitude of 35,786 km (22,236 mi).
>
> A special case of geosynchronous orbit is the geostationary orbit (often abbreviated GEO), which is a circular geosynchronous orbit in Earth's equatorial plane with both inclination and eccentricity equal to 0. A satellite in a geostationary orbit remains in the same position in the sky to observers on the surface.
>
> Communications satellites are often given geostationary or close-to-geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move but can be pointed permanently at the fixed location in the sky where the satellite appears.
