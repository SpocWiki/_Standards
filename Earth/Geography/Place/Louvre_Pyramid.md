> The **Louvre Pyramid** (French: Pyramide du Louvre) is a large glass-and-metal entrance way 
> and skylight designed by the Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei. 
> 
> The pyramid is in the main courtyard (Cour NapolÃ©on) of the Louvre Palace in Paris, surrounded by three smaller pyramids. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum, allowing light to the underground visitors hall, while also allowing sight lines of the palace to visitors in the hall, and through access galleries to the different wings of the palace. Completed in 1989 as part of the broader Grand Louvre project, it has become a landmark of Paris.
