## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Marina Bay Sands** is an integrated resort fronting Marina Bay in Singapore 
> and a landmark of the city. 
> 
> At its opening in 2010, it was deemed the world's most expensive standalone casino property 
> at S$8 billion (US$6.88 billion). 
> 
> The resort includes a 1,850-room hotel, a 120,000-square-metre (1,300,000 sq ft) 
> meetings and conventions facility at Sands Expo & Convention Centre, 
> a 74,000-square-metre (800,000 sq ft) luxury shopping mall, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 
> an ArtScience museum, a 2,183-capacity theatre, the world's first floating Apple store, 
> the world's first Louis Vuitton Island Maison, celebrity chef and signature restaurants, 
> and a casino with 500 tables and 3,000 electronic gaming machines. 
> 
> The complex includes three towers topped by the Sands Skypark, 
> a 340-metre-long (1,120 ft) skyway connecting the towers with a capacity of 3,902 people 
> and a 150 m (490 ft) infinity swimming pool, 
> set on top of the world's largest public cantilevered platform, 
> which overhangs the north tower by 66.5 m (218 ft). 
> The 20-hectare resort was designed by Moshe Safdie.
>
> The resort is owned by Las Vegas Sands in agreement with the Singaporean authorities. Marina Bay Sands was originally set to open in 2009, but its construction faced delays caused by escalating costs of material and labour shortages from the outset exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis. This pressured Las Vegas Sands to delay its projects elsewhere to complete the integrated resort. Its owner decided to open the integrated resort in stages, and it was approved by the Singapore authorities. The resort and SkyPark were officially opened on 23 and 24 June 2010 as part of a two-day celebration, following the casino's opening on 27 April that year. The SkyPark opened the following day. The theatre was completed in time for the first performance of Riverdance on 30 November. The indoor skating rink, which uses artificial ice, opened to a performance by Michelle Kwan on 18 December. The ArtScience Museum opened to the public and the debut of a 13-minute light, laser and water show called Wonder Full on 19 February 2011, marked the full completion of the integrated resort.
>
> The opening of Marina Bay Sands was held on 17 February 2011. It also marked the opening of the seven celebrity chef restaurants. The last portion of the Marina Bay Sands, the floating pavilions, were finally opened to the public when the two tenants, Louis Vuitton and Pangaea Club, opened on 18 and 22 September 2011, respectively. The property is currently being expanded to include a fourth hotel tower, an arena and additional convention space.
