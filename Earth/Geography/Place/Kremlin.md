> The **Kremlin** (also the Moscow Kremlin) is a fortified complex in Moscow, Russia. 
> Located in the centre of the country's capital city, the Moscow Kremlin comprises five palaces, 
> four cathedrals, and the enclosing Kremlin Wall along with the Kremlin towers. 
> 
> In the complex is the Grand Kremlin Palace, which was one of the royal residences of the Tsar of Russia, and now is the residence of the president of the Russian Federation. The Moscow Kremlin overlooks the Moskva River to the south, Saint Basil's Cathedral and Red Square to the east, and Alexander Garden to the west. 
>
> In the Russian language, kremlin denotes a 'fortress within a city', and there are many historical cities with Kremlin of their own. However, the Moscow Kremlin, the best known, also serves an international-politics metonym that identifies the Government of Russia. During the Cold War (1947â€“1991), the term The Kremlin meant the Government of the Soviet Union and the term Kremlinology meant the study of the decisions of the Soviet leaders and of Russian and Soviet politics. When open to the public, the Kremlin of Moscow offers supervised tours of the Moscow Kremlin Museums.
