> **Machu Picchu** is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru 
> on a mountain ridge at  2,430 meters (7,970 ft). 
> It is situated in the Machupicchu District of Urubamba Province 
> about 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco, 
> above the Sacred Valley and along the Urubamba River, 
> which forms a deep canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.
>
> Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", 
> Machu Picchu is one of the most iconic symbols of the Inca civilization 
> and a major archaeological site in the Americas. 
> 
> Built around 1450, it is believed to have served as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, 
> though no contemporary written records exist to confirm this. 
> The site was abandoned roughly a century later, likely during the Spanish conquest. 
> Modern radiocarbon dating places its occupation between c. 1420 and 1530.
>
> Machu Picchu was constructed in the classical Inca style, featuring finely crafted dry-stone walls. 
> Notable structures include the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, 
> and the Intihuatana ritual stone. 
> 
> Although known locally, it was brought to international attention in 1911 
> by American historian Hiram Bingham III. 
> Earlier visitors, including the Peruvian explorer Agustín Lizárraga, 
> had reached the site in the early 20th century. 
> The original Inca name of the site may have been Huayna Picchu, 
> after the mountain on which part of the complex stands.
>
> Designated a National Historic Sanctuary by Peru in 1981 
> and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, 
> Machu Picchu was also named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007. 
> As of 2024, the site receives over 1.5 million visitors annually, 
> making it Peru’s most visited international tourist destination.
