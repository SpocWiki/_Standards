> **Moai** or moʻai (  MOH-eye; Spanish: moái; Rapa Nui: moʻai, lit. 'statue') 
> are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) 
> in eastern Polynesia between the years 1250 and 1500. 
> 
> Nearly half are still at Rano Raraku, the main moai quarry, 
> but hundreds were transported from there and set on stone platforms called ahu 
> around the island's perimeter. 
> 
> Almost all moai have overly large heads, 
> which account for three-eighths of the size of the whole statue. They also have no legs. 
> The moai are chiefly the living faces (aringa ora) of deified ancestors (aringa ora ata tepuna).
>
> The statues still gazed inland across their clan lands when Europeans first visited the island in 1722, 
> but all of them had fallen by the latter part of the 19th century. 
> The moai were toppled in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, 
> possibly as a result of European contact or internecine tribal wars.
>
> The production and transportation of the more than 900 statues 
> is considered a remarkable creative and physical feat. 
> 
> The tallest moai erected, called Paro, was almost 10 metres (33 ft) high 
> and weighed 82 tonnes (81 long tons; 90 short tons). 
> 
> The heaviest moai erected was a shorter but squatter moai at Ahu Tongariki, 
> weighing 86 tonnes (85 long tons; 95 short tons). 
> 
> One unfinished sculpture, if completed, would be approximately 21 m (69 ft) tall, 
> with a weight of about 145–165 tonnes (143–162 long tons; 160–182 short tons). 
> 
> Statues are still being discovered as of 2023.
