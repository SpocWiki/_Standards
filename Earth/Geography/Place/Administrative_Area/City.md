> A **City** is a human settlement of a substantial size. 
> The term "city" has different meanings around the world 
> and in some places the settlement can be very small. 
> 
> Even where the term is limited to larger settlements, 
> there is no universally agreed definition of the lower boundary for their size. 
> 
> In a narrower sense, a city can be defined as a permanent and densely populated place 
> with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. 
> 
> Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, 
> sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. 
> Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations, 
> and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, 
> such as improving the efficiency of goods and service distribution.
>
> Historically, city dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, 
> but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, 
> more than half of the world population now lives in cities, 
> which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. 
> 
> Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas, 
> creating numerous commuters traveling toward city centres 
> for employment, entertainment, and education. 
> 
> However, in a world of intensifying globalization, 
> all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. 
> This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, 
> such as sustainable development, climate change, and global health. 
> 
> Because of these major influences on global issues, 
> the international community has prioritized investment in sustainable cities 
> through Sustainable Development Goal 11. 
> 
> Due to the efficiency of transportation and the smaller land consumption, 
> dense cities hold the potential to have a smaller ecological footprint per inhabitant 
> than more sparsely populated areas. 
> 
> Therefore, compact cities are often referred to as a crucial element in fighting climate change. 
> However, this concentration can also have some significant negative consequences, 
> such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, 
> and stressing water supplies and other resources.
