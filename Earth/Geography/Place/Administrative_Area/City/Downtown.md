> **Downtown** is a term primarily used in American and Canadian English to refer to 
> a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political, and geographic heart.  
> It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD). 
> It may also be a center for shopping and entertainment. 
> 
> Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city's employment 
> but are concentrated in services, including high-end services (office or white-collar jobs). 
> Sometimes, 
> smaller downtowns include lower population densities and nearby lower incomes than suburbs. 
> It is often distinguished as a hub of public transit and culture.
