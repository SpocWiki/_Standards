## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **City-state** is an independent sovereign city 
> which serves as the center of political, economic, and cultural life over its contiguous territory, 
> as opposed to a regular state or country comprising a capital city 
> and other cities and/or a countryside. 
> 
> City-states have existed in many parts of the world throughout history, 
> including cities such as Rome, Carthage, Athens and Sparta 
> and the Italian city-states during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, 
> such as Florence, Venice, Genoa and Milan.
>
> With the rise of nation states worldwide, 
> there remains some disagreement on the number of modern city-states that still exist; 
> Singapore, Monaco and Vatican City are the candidates most commonly discussed. 
> 
> Out of these, Singapore is the largest and most populous, 
> and is generally considered to be the last real city-state left in the world, 
> with full sovereignty, international borders, its own currency, a robust military, 
> and substantial international influence in its own right. 
> The Economist refers to it as the "world's only fully functioning city-state".
>
> Several non-sovereign cities enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
> and are often considered to be city-states, such as Hong Kong and Macau. 
> 
> Cities of the United Arab Emirates—most notably Dubai—are often cited as such as well. 
> Some non-sovereign overseas territories, such as Gibraltar, are also sometimes called city-states.
