> A **Capital city** or just capital is the municipality holding primary status 
> in a country, state, province, department, or other subnational division, 
> usually as its seat of the government. 
> 
> A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; 
> the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. 
> 
> In some jurisdictions, including several countries, 
> different branches of government are in different settlements, 
> sometimes meaning multiple official capitals. 
> In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital 
> and the seat of government, which is in another place. 
>
> English-language news media often use the name of the capital city 
> as an alternative name for the government of the country of which it is the capital, as a form of metonymy. 
> For example, the "relations between London and Washington" 
> refers to the "relations between the United Kingdom and the United States".
