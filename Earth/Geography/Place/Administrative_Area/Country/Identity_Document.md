> An identity document (abbreviated as ID) is a document proving a person's identity.
>
> If the identity document is a plastic card it is called an identity card (abbreviated as IC or ID card). 
> When the identity document incorporates a photographic portrait, it is called a photo ID. 
> In some countries, identity documents may be compulsory to have or carry.
>
> The identity document is used to connect a person to information about the person, 
> often in a database. 
> 
> The connection between the identity document and database 
> is based on personal information present on the document, such as the bearer's full name, birth date, address, an identification number, card number, gender, citizenship and more. 
> A unique national identification number is the most secure way, 
> but some countries lack such numbers or do not show them on identity documents.
>
> In the absence of an explicit identity document, other documents 
> such as driver's license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. 
> 
> Some countries do not accept driver's licenses for identification, 
> often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged. 
> 
> Most countries accept passports as a form of identification. 
> Some countries require all people to have an identity document available at all times. 
> Many countries require all foreigners to have a passport 
> or occasionally a national identity card from their home country available at any time 
> if they do not have a residence permit in the country.
