> A **Passport** is a formal travel document issued by a government 
> that certifies a person's identity and nationality for international travel. 
> 
> A passport allows its bearer to enter and temporarily reside in a foreign country, 
> access local aid and protection, and obtain consular assistance from their government. 
> 
> In addition to facilitating travel, 
> passports are a key mechanism for border security and regulating migration; 
> they may also serve as identity documents for various domestic purposes. 
>
> State-issued travel documents have existed in some form since antiquity; 
> the modern passport was universally adopted and standardized in 1920. 
> 
> The passport takes the form of a booklet bearing the name and emblem of the issuing government 
> and containing the biographical information of the individual, 
> including their full name, photograph, place and date of birth, and signature. 
> 
> A passport does not create any rights in the country being visited 
> nor impose any obligation on the issuing country; 
> rather, it provides certification to foreign government officials 
> of the holder's identity and right to travel, 
> with pages available for inserting entry and exit stamps and travel visas—
> endorsements that allow the individual to enter and temporarily reside in a country 
> for a period of time and under certain conditions.
>
> Since 1998, many countries have transitioned to biometric passports, 
> which contain an embedded microchip to facilitate authentication 
> and safeguard against counterfeiting. 
> 
> As of July 2024, over 150 jurisdictions issue such "e-passports"; 
> previously issued non-biometric passports usually remain valid until expiration.
>
> Eligibility for a passport varies by jurisdiction, although citizenship is a common prerequisite. 
> However, a passport may be issued to individuals 
> who do not have the status or full rights of citizenship, such as American or British nationals. 
> 
> Likewise, certain classes of individuals, such as diplomats and government officials, 
> may be issued special passports that provide certain rights and privileges, 
> such as immunity from arrest or prosecution.  
>
> While passports are typically issued by national governments, 
> certain subnational entities are authorised to issue passports to citizens residing within their borders. 
> 
> Additionally, other types of travel documents may serve a similar role to passports 
> but are subject to different eligibility requirements, purposes, or restrictions.
