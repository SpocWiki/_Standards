> A **Province** is an administrative division within a country or state. 
> The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia, 
> which was the major territorial and administrative unit of 
> the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. 
> 
> The term province has since been adopted by many countries. 
> In some countries with no actual provinces, 
> "the provinces" is a metaphorical term meaning "outside the capital city".
>
> While some provinces were produced artificially by colonial powers, 
> others were formed around local groups with their own ethnic identities. 
> 
> Many have their own powers independent of central or federal authority, 
> especially in Canada and Pakistan. 
> 
> In other countries, like China or France, 
> provinces are the creation of central government, with very little autonomy.
