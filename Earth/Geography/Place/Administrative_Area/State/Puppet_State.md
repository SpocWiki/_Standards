## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A puppet state, puppet régime, puppet government or dummy government 
> is a state that is de jure independent but de facto 
> completely dependent upon an outside power and subject to its orders. 
> 
> Puppet states have nominal sovereignty, 
> except that a foreign power effectively exercises control 
> through economic or military support. 
> 
> By leaving a local government in existence 
> the outside power evades all responsibility, 
> while at the same time successfully paralysing the local government they tolerate.
>
> Puppet states differ from allies, who choose their actions of their own initiative 
> or in accordance with treaties they have voluntarily entered. 
> 
> Puppet states are forced into legally endorsing actions already taken by a foreign power.
