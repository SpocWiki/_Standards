## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Citizenship** is a membership and allegiance to a sovereign state.
>
> Though citizenship is often conflated with nationality in today's English-speaking world, 
> international law does not usually use the term citizenship to refer to nationality; 
> these two notions are conceptually different dimensions of collective membership.
>
> Generally citizenships have no expiration 
> and allow persons to work, reside and vote in the polity, 
> as well as identify with the polity, possibly acquiring a passport. 
> 
> Though through discriminatory laws, like disfranchisement and outright apartheid, 
> citizens have been made second-class citizens. 
> 
> Historically, populations of states were mostly subjects, 
> while citizenship was a particular status 
> which originated in the rights of urban populations, 
> like the rights of the male public of cities and republics, particularly ancient city-states, 
> giving rise to a civitas and the social class of the burgher or bourgeoisie. 
> 
> Since then states have expanded the status of citizenship 
> to most of their national people, 
> with the extent of citizen rights differing between states.
