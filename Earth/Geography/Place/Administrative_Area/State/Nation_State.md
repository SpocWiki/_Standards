> A nation state, or nation-state, is a political entity in which the state 
> (a centralized political organization ruling over a population within a territory) 
> and the [[../../../../../Society/Anthropology/Sociology/Social_Stratification/Ethnic_Group/Nation|Nation]] (a community based on a common identity) 
> are broadly or ideally congruent. 
> 
> "Nation state" is a more precise concept than "country" or "state", 
> since a country or a state does not need to have 
> a predominant national or ethnic group.
>
> A nation, sometimes used in the sense of a common ethnicity, 
> may include a diaspora or refugees who live outside the nation-state; 
> some dispersed nations (such as the Roma nation, for example) 
> do not have a state where that ethnicity predominates. 
> 
> In a more general sense, a nation-state is simply 
> a large, politically sovereign country or administrative territory. 
> 
> A nation-state may or may not be contrasted with:
> - An empire, a political unit made up of several territories and peoples, 
>   typically established through conquest 
>   and marked by a dominant center and subordinate peripheries.
> - A multinational state, where no one ethnic or cultural group dominates 
>   (such a state may also be considered a multicultural state - 
>   depending on the degree of cultural assimilation of its various groups).
> - A city-state, which is both smaller than a "nation" 
>   in the sense of a "large sovereign country" 
>   and which may or may not be dominated by all or part of a single "nation" 
>   in the sense of a common ethnicity or culture.
> - A confederation, a league of sovereign states, 
>   which might or might not include nation-states.
> - A federated state, which may or may not be a nation-state, 
>   and which is only partially self-governing within a larger federation (for example, 
>   the state boundaries of Bosnia and Herzegovina are drawn along ethnic lines, 
>   but those of the United States are not).
>
> This article mainly discusses the more specific definition of a nation-state 
> as a typically sovereign country dominated by a particular ethnicity.
