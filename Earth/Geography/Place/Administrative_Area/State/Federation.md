> A **Federation** (also called a federal state) is an entity characterized by 
> a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions 
> under a federal government (federalism). 
> 
> In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, 
> as well as the division of power between them and the central government, 
> is constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision, 
> neither by the component states nor the federal political body without constitutional amendment.
>
> Sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions 
> so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.
>
> Overriding powers of a central authority theoretically 
> can include the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government 
> by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, 
> or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers 
> by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure "peace and good government" 
> or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty.
>
> The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, 
> or to be an example of federalism. 
> It can be considered in comparison with the unitary state. 
> France and Japan, for example, have been unitary for many centuries.
>
> The Austrian Empire was a unitary state with crown lands; 
> after the transformation into the Austria-Hungary monarchy, 
> the remaining crown lands of so-called Cisleithania 
> became federated as Länder of the Republic of Austria through the implementation of its constitution. 
> 
> Germany, with its 16 states, or Länder, and Nigeria, with its 36 states and federal capital territory, 
> are examples of federations. 
> 
> Federations are often multi-ethnic and cover a large area of territory 
> (such as Russia, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil, Pakistan or Australia), 
> but neither is necessarily the case (such as Saint Kitts and Nevis or the Federated States of Micronesia). About 40% of the world population lives in a federation.
