> A **Protectorate**, in the context of international relations, is a state 
> that is under protection by another state for defence against aggression and other violations of law. 
> 
> It is a dependent territory that enjoys autonomy over most of its internal affairs, 
> while still recognizing the suzerainty of a more powerful sovereign state without being a possession. 
> 
> In exchange, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations 
> depending on the terms of their arrangement. 
> Usually protectorates are established de jure by a treaty. 
> Under certain conditions—as with Egypt under British rule (1882–1914)—
> a state can also be labelled as a de facto protectorate or a veiled protectorate.
>
> A protectorate is different from a colony as it has local rulers, is not directly possessed, 
> and rarely experiences colonization by the suzerain state. 
> 
> A state that is under the protection of another state while retaining its "international personality" 
> is called a "protected state", not a protectorate.
