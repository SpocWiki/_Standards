## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A neighbourhood (Commonwealth English) or **Neighborhood** (American English) 
> is a geographically localized community within a larger town, city, suburb or rural area, 
> sometimes consisting of a single street and the buildings lining it. 
> 
> Neighbourhoods are often social communities 
> with considerable face-to-face interaction among members. 
> 
> Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, 
> but the following may serve as a starting point: 
> "Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area 
> and functionally as a set of social networks. 
> Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur—the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control."
