## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In general, a rural area or a countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. 
> Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. 
> Agricultural areas and areas with forestry are typically described as rural, 
> as well as other areas lacking substantial development. 
> Different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes.
>
> Rural areas have unique economic and social dynamics 
> due to their relationship with land-based industry such as 
> agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. 
> 
> Rural economics can be subject to boom and bust cycles 
> and vulnerable to extreme weather or natural disasters, such as droughts. 
> 
> These dynamics alongside larger economic forces encouraging urbanization 
> have led to significant demographic declines, called rural flight, 
> where economic incentives encourage younger populations 
> to go to cities for education and access to jobs, 
> leaving older, less educated, and less wealthy populations in the rural areas. 
> 
> Slower economic development results in poorer services like 
> healthcare, education, and infrastructure. 
> 
> This cycle of poverty contributes to why three quarters of the global impoverished live in rural areas 
> according to the Food and Agricultural Organization.
>
> Some communities have successfully encouraged economic development in rural areas, 
> with policies such as increased access to electricity or internet. 
> Historically, development policies have focused on larger extractive industries, 
> such as mining and forestry. 
> 
> However, recent approaches more focused on sustainable development 
> take into account economic diversification in these communities.
