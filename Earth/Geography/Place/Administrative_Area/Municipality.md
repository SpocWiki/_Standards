# [[Municipality]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Municipality** is usually a single administrative division 
> having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction 
> as granted by national and regional laws to which it is subordinate.
>
> The term municipality may also mean the governing body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district.
>
> The English word is derived from French municipalité, which in turn derives from the Latin municipalis, based on the word for social contract (municipium), referring originally to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).
>
> A municipality can be any political jurisdiction, from a sovereign state such as the Principality of Monaco, to a small village such as West Hampton Dunes, New York.
>
> The territory over which a municipality has jurisdiction may encompass:
> - only one populated place such as a city, town, or village
> - several such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the U.S. state of New Jersey (1798–1899) as townships governing several villages, municipalities of Mexico, municipalities of Colombia)
> - only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city, such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.
