## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **CN Tower** (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) communications 
> and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
> 
> Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. 
> Its name "CN" referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. 
> 
> Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets 
> prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, 
> a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.
>
> The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, 
> from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, 
> and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. 
> 
> It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world 
> and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. 
> 
> In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World 
> by the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
> It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.
>
> It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline 
> and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. 
> 
> It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 350 metres (1,150 ft), 
> and an entertainment complex.
