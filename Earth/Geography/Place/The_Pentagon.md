> **The Pentagon** is the headquarters building of the United States Department of Defense, 
> in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. 
> 
> The building was constructed on an accelerated schedule during World War II. 
> As a symbol of the U.S. military, the phrase The Pentagon is 
> often used as a metonym for the Department of Defense and its leadership.
>
> The building was designed by American architect George Bergstrom 
> and built by contractor John McShain. 
> 
> Ground was broken on 11 September 1941, and the building was dedicated on 15 January 1943. 
> General Brehon Somervell provided the major impetus 
> to gain Congressional approval for the project. 
> Colonel Leslie Groves was responsible for overseeing the project 
> for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which supervised it.
>
> The Pentagon is the world's second-largest office building, 
> with about 6.5 million square feet (600,000 m2) of floor space, 
> 3.7 million square feet (340,000 m2) of which are used as offices. 
> 
> It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, 
> and five ring corridors per floor with a total of 17.5 mi (28.2 km) of corridors, 
> with a central five-acre (2.0 ha) pentagonal plaza. 
> 
> About 23,000 military and civilian employees work in the Pentagon, 
> as well as about 3,000 non-defense support personnel.
>
> In 2001, the Pentagon was damaged during the September 11 attacks. 
> Five Al-Qaeda hijackers flew American Airlines Flight 77 into the western side of the building, 
> killing themselves and 184 other people, including 59 on the airplane and 125 in the Pentagon. 
> 
> It was the first significant foreign attack on federal facilities in the capital area 
> since the Burning of Washington during the War of 1812. 
> 
> Following the attacks, the western side of the building was repaired, 
> with a small indoor memorial and chapel added at the point of impact. 
> 
> In 2009, an outdoor memorial dedicated to the Pentagon victims of the September 11 attacks 
> was opened directly southwest of the building.
