> is the imperial palace complex in the center of the Imperial City in Beijing, China. 
> 
> It was the residence of 24 Ming and Qing dynasty Emperors, 
> and the center of political power in China for over 500 years from 1420 to 1924. 
>

> The Forbidden City is arguably the most famous palace in all of Chinese history, 
> and is the largest preserved royal palace complex still standing in the world.
>
> The Forbidden City was constructed from 1406 to 1420, 
> and was the imperial palace and winter residence of the Emperor of China 
> from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end of the Qing dynasty, 
> between 1420 and 1924. 
> 
> The Forbidden City served as the home of Chinese emperors and their households 
> and was the ceremonial and political center of the Chinese government for over 500 years. 
> 
> Since 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, 
> whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts 
> was built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. 
> The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.
>
> The complex claims to consist of 9,999 rooms in total, 
> although experts have shown in recent years that the number only amounts to 8,886, 
> covering 72 ha (720,000 m2)/178-acre. 
> 
> The palace exemplifies the opulence of the residences of the Chinese emperor 
> and the traditional Chinese palatial architecture, 
> and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. 
> 
> It is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world. 
> Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 14 million visitors annually, and received more than 19 million visitors in 2019.
