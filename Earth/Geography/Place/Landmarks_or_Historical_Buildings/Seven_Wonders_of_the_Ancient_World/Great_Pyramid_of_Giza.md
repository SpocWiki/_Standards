## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Great Pyramid of Giza** is the largest Egyptian pyramid. 
> It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. 
> 
> Built c. 2600 BC, over a period of about 26 years, 
> the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, 
> and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. 
> 
> It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, 
> which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis". 
> It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.
>
> Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), 
> the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. 
> Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, 
> which lowered the pyramid's height to the current 138.5 metres (454.4 ft); 
> what is seen today is the underlying core structure. 
> 
> The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, 
> giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), 
> which includes an internal hillock. 
> The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, 
> a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of ⁠5+1/2⁠ palms (a slope of 51°50'40").
>
> The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks, 
> weighing 6 million tonnes in total. 
> The majority of the stones are not uniform in size or shape, and are only roughly dressed. 
> The outside layers were bound together by mortar. 
> Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used for its construction. 
> Other blocks were imported by boat on the Nile: 
> - white limestone from Tura for the casing, and 
> - blocks of granite from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the "King's Chamber" structure.
>
> There are three known chambers inside of the Great Pyramid. 
> The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained unfinished. 
> The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, which contain a granite sarcophagus, 
> are above ground, within the pyramid structure. 
> 
> Hemiunu, Khufu's vizier, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. 
> Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses 
> attempt to explain the exact construction techniques, but, 
> as is the case for other such structures, there is no definite consensus.
>
> The funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile); tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives; an even smaller "satellite pyramid"; and five buried solar barques.
