> The **Seven Wonders of the Ancient World**, 
> also known as the Seven Wonders of the World or simply the Seven Wonders, 
> is a list of seven notable structures present during classical antiquity, 
> first established in the 1572 publication Octo Mundi Miracula using a combination of historical sources.
>
> The seven traditional wonders are the [[Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World/Great Pyramid of Giza]], the Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. 
> 
> Using modern-day countries, two of the wonders were located in Greece, 
> two in Turkey, two in Egypt, and one in Iraq. 
> Of the seven wonders, only the Pyramid of Giza, which is also by far the oldest of the wonders, 
> remains standing, while the others have been destroyed over the centuries. 
> There is scholarly debate over the exact nature of the Hanging Gardens, 
> and there is doubt as to whether they existed at all. 
>
> The first known list of seven wonders dates back to the 2ndâ€“1st century BC, 
> but this list differs from the canonical Octo Mundi Miracula version, 
> as do the other known lists from classical sources.
