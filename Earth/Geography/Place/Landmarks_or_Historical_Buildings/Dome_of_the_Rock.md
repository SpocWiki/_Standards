> The **Dome of the Rock** (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) 
> is an Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound 
> on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. 
> 
> It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, 
> the earliest archaeologically attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler 
> and its inscriptions contain the earliest epigraphic proclamations of Islam 
> and of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
>
> Its initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate 
> on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, 
> and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple 
> (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), 
> which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. 
> The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.
>
> Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. 
> Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, 
> when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, 
> and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, 
> in 1959–61 and again in 1993. 
> 
> The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era 
> Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), 
> which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
>
> The Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over 
> bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions 
> as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. 
> 
> It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, 
> and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, 
> towards which Jews turn during prayer. 
> 
> The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions 
> connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that 
> the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.
>
> Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, 
> it has been called "Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark" 
> along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall 
> and the "Resurrection Rotunda" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 
> 
> Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, 
> as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures 
> and almost always mention Muhammad. 
> 
> The Dome of the Rock remains a "unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects", 
> including as a "work of art and as a cultural and pious document", 
> according to art historian Oleg Grabar.
