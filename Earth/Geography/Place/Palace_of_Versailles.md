> The **Palace of Versailles** ( vair-SY, vur-SY; French: château de Versailles [ʃɑto d(ə) vɛʁsɑj] ) 
> is a former royal residence commissioned by King Louis XIV located in Versailles, 
> about 18 kilometres (11 mi) west of Paris, 
> in the Yvelines Department of Île-de-France region in France.
>
> The palace is owned by the government of France 
> and since 1995 has been managed, under the direction of the French Ministry of Culture, 
> by the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles. 
> About 15,000,000 people visit the palace, park, or gardens of Versailles every year, 
> making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world.
>
> Louis XIII built a hunting lodge at Versailles in 1623. 
> His successor, Louis XIV, expanded the château into a palace 
> that went through several expansions in phases from 1661 to 1715. 
> It was a favourite residence for both kings, 
> and in 1682, Louis XIV moved the seat of his court and government to Versailles, 
> making the palace the de facto capital of France. 
> 
> This state of affairs was continued by Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI, 
> who primarily made interior alterations to the palace, 
> but in 1789 the royal family and French court returned to Paris. 
> 
> For the rest of the French Revolution, the Palace of Versailles was largely abandoned 
> and emptied of its contents, and the population of the surrounding city plummeted.
>
> Napoleon, following his coronation as Emperor, 
> used the subsidiary palace, Grand Trianon, as a summer residence from 1810 to 1814, 
> but did not use the main palace. 
> 
> Following the Bourbon Restoration, when the king was returned to the throne, 
> he resided in Paris and it was not until the 1830s that meaningful repairs were made to the palace. 
> A museum of French history was installed within it, 
> replacing the courtiers apartments of the southern wing.
>
> The palace and park were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979 
> for its importance as the centre of power, art, and science 
> in France during the 17th and 18th centuries. 
> 
> The French Ministry of Culture has placed the palace, its gardens, 
> and some of its subsidiary structures on its list of culturally significant monuments.
