> **One World Trade Center**, also known as One WTC and as the Freedom Tower, 
> is the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City.  
> 
> Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, 
> One World Trade Center is the tallest building in the United States, 
> the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the seventh-tallest in the world. 
> 
> The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, 
> which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
> 
> The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, 
> on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center. 
> It is bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street to the north, 
> Fulton Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east.
>
> The construction of below-ground utility relocations, footings, 
> and foundations for the new building began on April 27, 2006. 
> 
> One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30, 2012, 
> when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building. 
> 
> The tower's steel structure was topped out on August 30, 2012. 
> On May 10, 2013, the final component of the skyscraper's spire was installed, 
> making the building, including its spire, reach a total height of 1,776 feet (541 m). 
> 
> Its height in feet is a deliberate reference to 
> the year when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. 
> The building opened on November 3, 2014; the One World Observatory opened on May 29, 2015.
> The building has 94 stories, with the top floor numbered 104.
>
> On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) confirmed that 
> the building would be officially known by its legal name of "One World Trade Center", 
> rather than its colloquial name of "Freedom Tower". 
>
> The new World Trade Center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings 
> built along Greenwich Street, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, 
> located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood, 
> and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub to its east. 
> 
> The construction of the new building is part of an effort to 
> memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex.
