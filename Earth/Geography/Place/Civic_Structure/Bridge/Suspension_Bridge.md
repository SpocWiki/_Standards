> A suspension bridge is a type of bridge 
> in which the deck is hung below suspension cables on vertical suspenders. 
> 
> The first modern examples of this type of bridge were built in the early 1800s. 
> Simple suspension bridges, which lack vertical suspenders, 
> have a long history in many mountainous parts of the world.
>
> Besides the bridge type most commonly called suspension bridges, 
> there are other types of suspension bridges.  
> 
> The type covered here has cables suspended between towers, 
> with vertical suspender cables that transfer the live and dead loads of the deck below, 
> upon which traffic crosses. 
> 
> This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. 
> Like other suspension bridge types, this type often is constructed without the use of falsework.
>
> The suspension cables must be anchored at each end of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into tension in these main cables. The main cables continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span. Otherwise, the bridge will typically have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or their own trusswork. In cases where trusswork supports the spans, there will be very little arc in the outboard main cables.
