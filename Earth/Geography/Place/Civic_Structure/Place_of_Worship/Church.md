## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A church, church building, church house, or chapel 
> is a building used for Christian worship services and Christian activities. 
> The earliest identified Christian church is a house church founded between 233 AD and 256 AD. 
> Church is also used to describe a body or assembly of Christian believers, 
> while "the Church" may be used to refer to the worldwide Christian religious community as a whole.
>
> In traditional Christian architecture, the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross 
> with the centre aisle and seating representing the vertical beam 
> and the bema and altar forming the horizontal. 
> 
> Towers or domes may inspire contemplation of the heavens. 
> Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and layouts. 
> Some buildings designed for other purposes have been converted to churches, 
> while many original church buildings have been put to other uses. 
> From the 11th to the 14th century, there had been a wave of church construction in Western Europe.
>
> Many churches worldwide are of considerable historical, national, cultural, and architectural significance, 
> with several included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
