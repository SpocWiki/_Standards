> A **Temple** (from the Latin templum) is a place of worship, 
> a building used for spiritual rituals and activities such as prayer and sacrifice. 
> 
> By convention, the specially built places of worship for some religions 
> are commonly called "temples" in English, 
> while those of other religions are not, even though they fulfill very similar functions.  
>
> The religions for which the terms are used include the great majority of ancient religions 
> that are now extinct, such as the Ancient Egyptian religion and the Ancient Greek religion. 
> 
> Among religions still active: 
> - Hinduism (whose temples are called mandir or kovil), 
> - Buddhism (whose temples are called vihara), 
> - Sikhism (whose temples are called gurudwara), 
> - Jainism (whose temples are sometimes called derasar), 
> - Zoroastrianism (whose temples are sometimes called agiary), 
> - the Baháʼí Faith (which are often simply referred to as Baháʼí House of Worship), 
> - Taoism (which are sometimes called daoguan), 
> - Shinto (which are often called jinja), 
> - Confucianism (which are sometimes called the Temple of Confucius).
>
> Religions whose places of worship are generally not called "temples" in English include Christianity, which has churches, Islam with mosques, and Judaism with synagogues (although some of these use "temple" as a name).
>
> The form and function of temples are thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be, in some sense, the "house" of one or more deities. Typically, offerings of some form are made to the deity, and other rituals are enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain and operate the temple. The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts, or even the whole main building, can only be accessed by the clergy. Temples typically have a main building and a larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings or may be a dome-shaped structure, much like an igloo.
>
> The word comes from Ancient Rome, where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or augur. It has the same root as the word "template", a plan in preparation for the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur.
