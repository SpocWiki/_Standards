> A **Moat** is a deep, broad ditch dug around a castle, fortification, building, or town, 
> historically to provide it with a preliminary line of defence. 
> 
> Moats can be dry or filled with water. 
> 
> In some places, moats evolved into more extensive water defences, 
> including natural or artificial lakes, dams and sluices. 
> 
> In older fortifications, such as hillforts, they are usually referred to simply as ditches, 
> although the function is similar. 
> 
> In later periods, moats or water defences may be largely ornamental. 
> They could also act as a sewer.
