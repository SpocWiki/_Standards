> The **Equator** is the circle of latitude that divides Earth into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. 
> It is an imaginary line located at 0 degrees latitude, about 40,075 km (24,901 mi) in circumference, 
> halfway between the North and South poles. 
> The term can also be used for any other celestial body that is roughly spherical.
>
> In spatial (3D) geometry, as applied in astronomy, 
> the equator of a rotating spheroid (such as a planet) is the parallel (circle of latitude) 
> at which latitude is defined to be 0°. 
> 
> It is an imaginary line on the spheroid, equidistant from its poles, 
> dividing it into northern and southern hemispheres. 
> In other words, it is the intersection of the spheroid with the plane perpendicular to its axis of rotation 
> and midway between its geographical poles.
>
> On and near the equator (on Earth), noontime sunlight appears almost directly overhead 
> (no more than about 23° from the zenith) every day, year-round. 
> 
> Consequently, the equator has a rather stable daytime temperature throughout the year. 
> On the equinoxes (approximately 20 March and 23 September) 
> the subsolar point crosses Earth's equator at a shallow angle, 
> sunlight shines perpendicular to Earth's axis of rotation, 
> and all latitudes have nearly a 12-hour day and 12-hour night.
