> **Cave**s or caverns are natural voids under the Earth's surface. 
> Caves often form by the weathering of rock and can extend deep underground. 
> Exogene caves are smaller openings that extend a relatively short distance underground 
> (such as rock shelters). 
> Caves which extend further underground than the opening is wide are called endogene caves.
>
> Speleology is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the cave environment. 
> Visiting or exploring caves for recreation may be called caving, potholing, or spelunking.
