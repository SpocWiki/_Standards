> **Navigation** is a field of study that focuses on the process of 
> monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. 
> 
> The field of navigation includes four general categories: 
> - land navigation, 
> - marine navigation, 
> - aeronautic navigation, and 
> - space navigation. 
> 
> It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge 
> used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. 
> 
> All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns. Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction. In this sense, navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation.
>
> For marine navigation, this involves the safe movement of ships, boats and other nautical craft either on or underneath the water using positions from navigation equipment with appropriate nautical charts (electronic and paper). Navigation equipment for ships is mandated under the requirements of the SOLAS Convention, depending on ship size. For land navigation, this involves the movement of persons, animals and vehicles from one place to another by means of navigation equipment (such as a compass or GNSS receivers), maps and visual navigation marks across urban or rural environments. Aeronautic (air) navigation involves piloting an aircraft from one geographic position to another position while monitoring the position as the flight progresses.
