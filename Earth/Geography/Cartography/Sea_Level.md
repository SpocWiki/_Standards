## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Mean sea level (MSL, often shortened to sea level) is an average surface level 
> of one or more among Earth's coastal bodies of water 
> from which heights such as elevation may be measured. 
> 
> The global MSL is a type of vertical datum – a standardised geodetic datum – 
> that is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, 
> or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured 
> to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. 
> 
> A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is instead 
> a long-term average of tide gauge readings at a particular reference location.
>
> The term above sea level generally refers to the height above mean sea level (AMSL). 
> The term APSL means above present sea level, 
> comparing sea levels in the past with the level today.
>
> Earth's radius at sea level is 6,378.137 km (3,963.191 mi) at the equator. 
> It is 6,356.752 km (3,949.903 mi) at the poles and 6,371.001 km (3,958.756 mi) on average. 
> 
> This flattened spheroid, combined with local gravity anomalies, defines the geoid of the Earth, 
> which approximates the local mean sea level for locations in the open ocean. 
> 
> The geoid includes a significant depression in the Indian Ocean, 
> whose surface dips as much as 106 m (348 ft) below the global mean sea level 
> (excluding minor effects such as tides and currents).
