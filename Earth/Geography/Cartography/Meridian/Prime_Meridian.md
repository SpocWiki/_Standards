## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A prime meridian is an arbitrarily chosen meridian (a line of longitude) 
> in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. 
> 
> On a spheroid, a prime meridian and its anti-meridian (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) 
> form a great ellipse. 
> 
> This divides the body (e.g. Earth) into two hemispheres: 
> the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere (for an east-west notational system). 
> 
> For Earth's prime meridian, various conventions 
> have been used or advocated in different regions throughout history. 
> Earth's current international standard prime meridian is the IERS Reference Meridian. 
> It is derived, but differs slightly, from the Greenwich Meridian, the previous standard.
>
> Longitudes for the Earth and Moon are measured from their prime meridian (at 0°) 
> to 180° east and west. 
> 
> For all other Solar System bodies, longitude is measured from 0° (their prime meridian) to 360°. 
> West longitudes are used if the rotation of the body is prograde (or 'direct', like Earth), 
> meaning that its direction of rotation is the same as that of its orbit. 
> East longitudes are used if the rotation is retrograde.
