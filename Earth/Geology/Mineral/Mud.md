> **Mud** (from Middle Low German  mudde, mod(de) 'thick mud', or Middle Dutch) 
> is loam, silt or clay mixed with water. 
> 
> Mud is usually formed after rainfall or near water sources. 
> Ancient mud deposits hardened over geological time to form sedimentary rock 
> such as shale or mudstone (generally called lutites). 
> 
> When geological deposits of mud are formed in estuaries, 
> the resultant layers are termed bay muds. 
> 
> Mud has also been used for centuries as a construction resource for mostly houses 
> and also used as a binder. 
> 
> An Old English word for it was fen, now in most dialects referring to a type of wetland.
