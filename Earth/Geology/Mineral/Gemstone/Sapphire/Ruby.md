> **Ruby** is a pinkish-red to blood-red [[../../Gemstone|Gemstone]], a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). 
> Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable. 
> Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[Sapphire]]s; 
> given that the rest of the corundum species are called as such, 
> rubies are sometimes referred to as "red sapphires".
>
> Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, alongside amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond. 
> The word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red. 
> The color of a ruby is due to the presence of chromium.
>
> Some gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, 
> such as the Black Prince's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown, are actually spinels. 
> These were once known as "Balas rubies".
>
> The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, 
> affect its value. 
> 
> The brightest and most valuable shade of red, called blood-red or pigeon blood, 
> commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. 
> After color comes clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, 
> but a ruby **without any** needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. 
> 
> Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually pinker than garnet, 
> although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. 
> 
> The world's most valuable ruby to be sold at auction is the Estrela de Fura, 
> which sold for US$34.8 million.
