> **Quartzite** is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock 
> that was originally pure quartz sandstone. 
> 
> Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure 
> usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts, 
> and hence quartzite is a metasandstone. 
> 
> Pure quartzite is usually white to grey, 
> though quartzites often occur in various shades of pink and red 
> due to varying amounts of hematite. 
> Other colors, such as yellow, green, blue  and orange, are due to other minerals.
>
> The term quartzite is also sometimes used for very hard but unmetamorphosed sandstones 
> that are composed of quartz grains thoroughly cemented with additional quartz. 
> Such sedimentary rock has come to be described as orthoquartzite 
> to distinguish it from metamorphic quartzite, 
> which is sometimes called metaquartzite to emphasize its metamorphic origins.
>
> Quartzite is very resistant to chemical weathering 
> and often forms ridges and resistant hilltops. 
> 
> The nearly pure silica content of the rock provides little material for soil; 
> therefore, the quartzite ridges are often bare or covered only with a very thin layer of soil 
> and little (if any) vegetation. 
> 
> Some quartzites contain just enough weather-susceptible nutrient-bearing minerals 
> such as carbonates and chlorite to form a loamy, fairly fertile though shallow and stony soil.
>
> Quartzite has been used since prehistoric times for stone tools. 
> It is presently used for decorative dimension stone, 
> as crushed stone in highway construction, 
> and as a source of silica for production of silicon and silicon compounds.
