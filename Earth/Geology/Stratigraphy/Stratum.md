> In geology and related fields, a **Stratum** (pl.: strata) is a layer of rock or sediment 
> characterized by certain lithologic properties or attributes 
> that distinguish it from adjacent layers from which it is separated by visible surfaces 
> known as either bedding surfaces or bedding planes. 
> 
> Prior to the publication of the International Stratigraphic Guide, 
> older publications have defined a stratum as being either equivalent to a single bed 
> or composed of a number of beds; as a layer greater than 1 cm in thickness 
> and constituting a part of a bed; or a general term that includes both bed and lamina. 
> 
> Related terms are substrate and substratum (pl.substrata), 
> a stratum underlying another stratum.
