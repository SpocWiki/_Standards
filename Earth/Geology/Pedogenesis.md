## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Soil formation, also known as **Pedogenesis**, is the process of soil genesis 
> as regulated by the effects of place, environment, and history. 
> 
> Biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils. 
> 
> These alterations lead to the development of layers, termed soil horizons, 
> distinguished by differences in color, structure, texture, and chemistry. 
> These features occur in patterns of soil type distribution, 
> forming in response to differences in soil forming factors.
>
> Pedogenesis is studied as a branch of pedology, 
> the study of soil in its natural environment. 
> 
> Other branches of pedology are the study of soil morphology and soil classification. 
> The study of pedogenesis is important to understanding soil distribution patterns 
> in current (soil geography) and past (paleopedology) geologic periods.
