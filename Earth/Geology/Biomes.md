> A biome is a distinct geographical region with specific climate, vegetation, and animal life. 
> It consists of a biological community 
> that has formed in response to its physical environment and regional climate. 
> In 1935, Tansley added the climatic and soil aspects to the idea, calling it ecosystem. 
> The International Biological Program (1964–74) projects popularized the concept of biome.
>
> However, in some contexts, the term biome is used in a different manner. 
> In German literature, particularly in the Walter terminology, the term is used similarly as biotope 
> (a concrete geographical unit), while the biome definition used in this article is used as an international, 
> non-regional, terminology—irrespectively of the continent in which an area is present, 
> it takes the same biome name—and corresponds to his "zonobiome", "orobiome" 
> and "pedobiome" (**Biomes** determined by climate zone, altitude or soil).
>
> In the Brazilian literature, the term biome is sometimes used as a synonym of biogeographic province, 
> an area based on species composition (the term floristic province being used when plant species are considered), 
> or also as synonym of the "morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain" of Ab'Sáber, 
> a geographic space with subcontinental dimensions, 
> with the predominance of similar geomorphologic and climatic characteristics, 
> and of a certain vegetation form. Both include many biomes in fact.
