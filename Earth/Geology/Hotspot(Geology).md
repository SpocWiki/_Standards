> In geology, hotspots (or hot spots) are volcanic locales 
> thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot 
> compared with the surrounding mantle. 
> 
> Examples include the Hawaii, Iceland, and Yellowstone hotspots. 
> A hotspot's position on the Earth's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries, 
> and so hotspots may create a chain of volcanoes as the plates move above them.
>
> There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins. 
> One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes 
> that rise as thermal diapirs from the coreâ€“mantle boundary. 
> 
> The alternative plate theory is that the mantle source beneath a hotspot is not anomalously hot, 
> rather the crust above is unusually weak or thin, 
> so that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths.
