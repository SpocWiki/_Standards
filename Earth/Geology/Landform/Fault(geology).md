> In geology, a fault is a planar fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock 
> across which there has been significant displacement as a result of rock-mass movements. 
> 
> Large faults within Earth's crust result from the action of plate tectonic forces, 
> with the largest forming the boundaries between the plates, 
> such as the megathrust faults of subduction zones or transform faults. 
> Energy release associated with rapid movement on active faults is the cause of most earthquakes. 
> Faults may also displace slowly, by aseismic creep.
>
> A fault plane is the plane that represents the fracture surface of a fault. 
> A fault trace or fault line is a place where the fault can be seen or mapped on the surface. A fault trace is also the line commonly plotted on geological maps to represent a fault.
>
> A fault zone is a cluster of parallel faults. However, the term is also used for the zone of crushed rock along a single fault. Prolonged motion along closely spaced faults can blur the distinction, as the rock between the faults is converted to fault-bound lenses of rock and then progressively crushed.
