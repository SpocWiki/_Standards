> Submarine volcanoes are underwater vents or fissures in the Earth's surface 
> from which magma can erupt. 
> 
> Many submarine volcanoes are located near areas of tectonic plate formation, 
> known as mid-ocean ridges. 
> 
> The volcanoes at mid-ocean ridges alone 
> are estimated to account for 75% of the magma output on Earth. 
> 
> Although most submarine volcanoes are located in the depths of seas and oceans, 
> some also exist in shallow water, 
> and these can discharge material into the atmosphere during an eruption. 
> 
> The total number of submarine volcanoes is estimated to be over one million 
> (most are now extinct) of which some 75,000 rise more than 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) 
> above the seabed. 
> 
> Only 119 submarine volcanoes in Earth's oceans and seas 
> are known to have erupted during the last 11,700 years.
>
> Hydrothermal vents, sites of abundant biological activity, 
> are commonly found near submarine volcanoes.
