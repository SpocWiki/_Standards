## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A volcanic plug, also called a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic object 
> created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano. 
> 
> When present, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of high gas pressure 
> if rising volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, 
> and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption.  
> In a plinian eruption the plug is destroyed and ash is ejected.
>
> Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, 
> while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side. 
> 
> Such landforms are called crag and tail. 
> If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock 
> while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive upstanding landform.
