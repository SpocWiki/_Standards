## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In volcanology, a lava dome is a circular, mound-shaped protrusion 
> resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. 
> 
> Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in convergent plate boundary settings. 
> 
> Around 6% of eruptions on Earth form lava domes. 
> The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt (e.g. Semeru, 1946) 
> to rhyolite (e.g. Chaiten, 2010) although the majority are of intermediate composition 
> (such as Santiaguito, dacite-andesite, present day). 
> 
> The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity 
> that prevents the lava from flowing very far. 
> This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous basaltic and andesitic domes weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.
>
> Existence of lava domes has been suggested for some domed structures on the Moon, Venus, and Mars, e.g. the Martian surface in the western part of Arcadia Planitia and within Terra Sirenum.
