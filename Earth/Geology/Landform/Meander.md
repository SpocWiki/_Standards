## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Meander** is one of a series of regular sinuous curves in the channel of a river or other watercourse. 
> 
> It is produced as a watercourse erodes the sediments of an outer, concave bank 
> (cut bank or river cliff) and deposits sediments on an inner, convex bank 
> which is typically a point bar. 
> The result of this coupled erosion and sedimentation is the formation of a sinuous course 
> as the channel migrates back and forth across the axis of a floodplain.
>
> The zone within which a meandering stream periodically shifts its channel 
> is known as a meander belt. 
> It typically ranges from 15 to 18 times the width of the channel. 
> Over time, meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as 
> to create civil engineering challenges for local municipalities 
> attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.
>
> The degree of meandering of the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse 
> is measured by its sinuosity. 
> The sinuosity of a watercourse is the ratio of the length of the channel 
> to the straight line down-valley distance. 
> 
> Streams or rivers with a single channel and sinuosities of 1.5 or more 
> are defined as meandering streams or rivers.

The term derives from the winding river [Menderes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk_Menderes_River "Büyük Menderes River") located in [Asia-Minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Minor "Asia-Minor") 
and known to the [Ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks "Ancient Greeks") as Μαίανδρος _Maiandros_ (Latin: Maeander)
