> A **Dune** is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. 
> It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill. 
> 
> An area with dunes is called a dune system or a dune complex. 
> A large dune complex is called a dune field, 
> while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes, with little or no vegetation, 
> are called ergs or sand seas. 
> 
> Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, 
> but most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, 
> where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter slip face in the lee side. 
> The valley or trough between dunes is called a dune slack.
>
> Dunes are most common in desert environments, 
> where the lack of moisture hinders the growth of vegetation 
> that would otherwise interfere with the development of dunes. 
> 
> However, sand deposits are not restricted to deserts, 
> and dunes are also found along sea shores, 
> along streams in semiarid climates, 
> in areas of glacial outwash, 
> and in other areas where poorly cemented sandstone bedrock disintegrates 
> to produce an ample supply of loose sand. 
> 
> Subaqueous dunes can form from the action of water flow (fluvial processes) 
> on sand or gravel beds of rivers, estuaries, and the sea-bed.
>
> Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline 
> directly inland from the beach. 
> 
> In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land 
> against potential ravages by storm waves from the sea. 
> 
> Artificial dunes are sometimes constructed to protect coastal areas. 
> The dynamic action of wind and water can sometimes cause dunes to drift, 
> which can have serious consequences. 
> 
> For example, the town of Eucla, Western Australia, had to be relocated in the 1890s 
> because of dune drift.
>
> The modern word "dune" came into English from French around 1790, 
> which in turn came from Middle Dutch dūne.
