## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A stack or sea stack is a geological landform 
> consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock 
> in the sea near a coast, formed by wave erosion. 
> 
> Stacks are formed over time by wind and water, processes of coastal geomorphology. 
> They are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, 
> which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. 
> 
> The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland, causing them to later collapse, 
> forming free-standing stacks and even a small island. 
> 
> Without the constant presence of water, 
> stacks also form when a natural arch collapses under gravity, 
> due to sub-aerial processes like wind erosion. 
> 
> Erosion causes the arch to collapse, 
> leaving the pillar of hard rock standing away from the coast—the stack. 
> 
> Eventually, erosion will cause the stack to collapse, leaving a stump. 
> 
> Stacks can provide important nesting locations for seabirds, 
> and many are popular for rock climbing, primarily in Ireland.
>
> Isolated steep-sided, rocky oceanic islets typically of volcanic origin, 
> are also loosely called "stacks" or "volcanic stacks".
