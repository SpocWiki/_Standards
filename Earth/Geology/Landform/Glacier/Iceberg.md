## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Iceberg** is a piece of fresh water ice more than 15 meters (16 yards) long 
> that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water. 
> Smaller chunks of floating glacially derived ice are called "growlers" or "bergy bits". 
> 
> Much of an iceberg is below the water's surface, which led to the expression "tip of the iceberg" 
> to illustrate a small part of a larger unseen issue. 
> Icebergs are considered a serious maritime hazard.
>
> Icebergs vary considerably in size and shape. 
> Icebergs that calve from glaciers in Greenland are often irregularly shaped 
> while Antarctic ice shelves often produce large tabular (table top) icebergs. 
> 
> The largest iceberg in recent history, named B-15, 
> was measured at nearly 300 by 40 kilometres (186 by 25 mi) in 2000. 
> 
> The largest iceberg on record was an Antarctic tabular iceberg 
> measuring 335 by 97 kilometres (208 by 60 mi) 
> sighted 240 kilometres (150 mi) west of Scott Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, 
> by the USS Glacier on November 12, 1956. 
> This iceberg was larger than Belgium.
