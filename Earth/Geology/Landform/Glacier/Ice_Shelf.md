> An ice shelf is a large platform of glacial ice floating on the ocean, fed by one or multiple tributary glaciers. 
> Ice shelves form along coastlines 
> where the ice thickness is insufficient to displace the more dense surrounding ocean water. 
> The boundary between the ice shelf (floating) and grounded ice (resting on bedrock or sediment) 
> is referred to as the grounding line; the boundary between the ice shelf and the open ocean 
> (often covered by sea ice) is the ice front or calving front. 
>
> Ice shelves are found in Antarctica and the Arctic (Greenland, Northern Canada, and the Russian Arctic), 
> and can range in thickness from about 100–1,000 m (330–3,280 ft). 
> The world's largest ice shelves are the Ross Ice Shelf and the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
>
> The movement of ice shelves is principally driven by gravity-induced pressure from the grounded ice. 
> That flow continually moves ice from the grounding line to the seaward front of the shelf. 
> Typically, a shelf front will extend forward for years or decades between major calving events 
> (calving is the sudden release and breaking away of a mass of ice from a glacier, iceberg, ice front, ice shelf, or crevasse). Snow accumulation on the upper surface and melting from the lower surface are also important to the mass balance of an ice shelf. Ice may also accrete onto the underside of the shelf.  
>
> The effects of climate change are visible in the changes to the cryosphere, 
> such as reduction in sea ice and ice sheets, and disruption of ice shelves. 
> 
> In the last several decades, glaciologists have observed consistent decreases in ice shelf extent 
> through melt, calving, and complete disintegration of some shelves. 
> 
> Well studied examples include disruptions of the Thwaites Ice Shelf, Larsen Ice Shelf, 
> Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (all three in the Antarctic) and the disruption of the Ellesmere Ice Shelf in the Arctic.
