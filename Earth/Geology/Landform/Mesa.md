> A **Mesa** is an isolated, flat-topped elevation, ridge, or hill, 
> bounded from all sides by steep escarpments and standing distinctly above a surrounding plain. 
> 
> Mesas consist of flat-lying soft sedimentary rocks, such as shales, 
> capped by a resistant layer of harder rock, like sandstone or limestone, 
> forming a caprock that protects the flat summit. 
> The caprock may also include dissected lava flows or eroded duricrust. 
>
> Unlike a plateau, which is a broader, elevated region that may not have horizontal bedrock 
> (e.g., Tibetan Plateau), a mesa is defined by flat-lying strata and steep-sided isolation. 
> Large, flat-topped plateaus with horizontal strata, 
> less isolated and often part of extensive plateau systems, are called tablelands. 
> 
> A butte is a smaller, eroded mesa with a limited summit, 
> while a cuesta has a gentle dip slope and one steep escarpment due to tilted strata.
