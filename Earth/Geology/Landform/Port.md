> A **Port** is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, 
> where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers. 
> 
> Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, 
> such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals. 
> Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, 
> many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their histories.
>
> Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 
> 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port. 
> 
> For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements 
> that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports. 
> Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, 
> the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, 
> such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan. 
> 
> As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland. 
> Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries.
>
> Ports can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, 
> most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution. 
> 
> Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change 
> as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding. 
> Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices 
> and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction.
