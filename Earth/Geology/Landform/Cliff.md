> In geography and geology, a **Cliff** or rock face is 
> an area of rock which has a general angle defined by the vertical, or nearly vertical. 
> 
> Cliffs are formed by the processes of weathering and erosion, with the effect of gravity. 
> Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas, escarpments and along rivers. 
> 
> Cliffs are usually composed of rock that is resistant to weathering and erosion. 
> The sedimentary rocks that are most likely to form cliffs 
> include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. 
> Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt also often form cliffs.
>
> An escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff formed by the movement of a geologic fault, a landslide, 
> or sometimes by rock slides or falling rocks which change the differential erosion of the rock layers.
>
> Most cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base.  In arid areas or under high cliffs, they are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. In areas of higher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. Many cliffs also feature tributary waterfalls or rock shelters. Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end of a ridge, with mushroom rocks or other types of rock columns remaining. Coastal erosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline.
>
> The British Ordnance Survey distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the topper edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along lower edge).
