> **Karst** is a topography formed from the dissolution of soluble carbonate rocks 
> such as limestone and dolomite. 
> 
> It is characterized by features like poljes above 
> and drainage systems with sinkholes and caves underground. 
> 
> There is some evidence that karst may occur in more weathering-resistant rocks 
> such as quartzite given the right conditions.
>
> Subterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few to no rivers or lakes. 
> In regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) 
> or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, 
> distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and can be totally missing above ground.
>
> The study of paleokarst (buried karst in the stratigraphic column) is important in petroleum geology 
> because as much as 50% of the world's hydrocarbon reserves are hosted in carbonate rock, 
> and much of this is found in porous karst systems.
