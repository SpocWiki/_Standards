> The carbon cycle is a part of the biogeochemical cycle where carbon is exchanged among the 
> - biosphere, 
> - pedosphere, 
> - geosphere, 
> - hydrosphere, and 
> - atmosphere of Earth. 
> 
> Other major biogeochemical cycles include the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle. 
> Carbon is the main component of biological compounds 
> as well as a major component of many rocks such as limestone. 
> 
> The carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to making Earth capable of sustaining life. 
> It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, 
> as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration (storage) to and release from carbon sinks. 
> At 422.7 parts per million (ppm), the global average carbon dioxide has set a new record high in 2024. 
>
> To describe the dynamics of the carbon cycle, a distinction can be made between the fast and slow carbon cycle. 
> The fast cycle is also referred to as the biological carbon cycle. 
> Fast cycles can complete within years, moving substances from atmosphere to biosphere, 
> then back to the atmosphere. 
> 
> Slow or geological cycles (also called deep carbon cycle) can take millions of years to complete, 
> moving substances through the Earth's crust between rocks, soil, ocean and atmosphere. 
>
> Humans have disturbed the carbon cycle for many centuries. 
> They have done so by modifying land use and by mining and burning carbon from ancient organic remains 
> (coal, petroleum and gas). 
> Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased nearly 52% over pre-industrial levels by 2020, 
> resulting in global warming. 
> 
> The increased carbon dioxide has also caused a reduction in the ocean's pH value 
> and is fundamentally altering marine chemistry. Carbon dioxide is critical for photosynthesis.
