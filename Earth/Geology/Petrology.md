> **Petrology** (from Ancient Greek  πέτρος (pétros) 'rock' and  -λογία (-logía) 'study of') 
> is the branch of geology that studies rocks, their mineralogy, composition, texture, structure 
> and the conditions under which they form. 
> 
> Petrology has three subdivisions: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology. 
> 
> Igneous and metamorphic petrology are commonly taught together 
> because both make heavy use of chemistry, chemical methods, and phase diagrams. 
> 
> Sedimentary petrology is commonly taught together with stratigraphy 
> because it deals with the processes that form sedimentary rock. 
> 
> Modern sedimentary petrology is making increasing use of chemistry.
