> **Groundwater** is the water present beneath Earth's surface in rock and soil pore spaces 
> and in the fractures of rock formations. 
> About 30 percent of all readily available fresh water in the world is groundwater. 
> A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer 
> when it can yield a usable quantity of water. 
> 
> The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in 
> rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. 
> Groundwater is recharged from the surface; it may discharge from the surface naturally 
> at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. 
> 
> Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use 
> by constructing and operating extraction wells. 
> The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, 
> also called groundwater hydrology.
>
> Typically, groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers, 
> but, in the technical sense, it can also contain soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), 
> immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. 
> 
> Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication 
> that can possibly influence the movement of faults. 
> 
> It is likely that much of Earth's subsurface contains some water, 
> which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. 
>
> Groundwater is often cheaper, more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water. 
> Therefore, it is commonly used for public drinking water supplies. 
> For example, groundwater provides the largest source of usable water storage in the United States, 
> and California annually withdraws the largest amount of groundwater of all the states. 
> Underground reservoirs contain far more water 
> than the capacity of all surface reservoirs and lakes in the US, including the Great Lakes. 
> Many municipal water supplies are derived solely from groundwater. 
> Over 2 billion people rely on it as their primary water source worldwide.
>
> Human use of groundwater causes environmental problems. 
> For example, polluted groundwater is less visible and more difficult to clean up 
> than pollution in rivers and lakes. 
> 
> Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. 
> Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, 
> excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, 
> tailings and process wastewater from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, 
> leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. 
> 
> Additionally, groundwater is susceptible to saltwater intrusion in coastal areas 
> and can cause land subsidence when extracted unsustainably, 
> leading to sinking cities (like Bangkok) and loss in elevation 
> (such as the multiple meters lost in the Central Valley of California). 
> 
> These issues are made more complicated by sea level rise and other effects of climate change, 
> particularly those on the water cycle. 
> 
> Earth's axial tilt has shifted 31 inches because of human groundwater pumping.
