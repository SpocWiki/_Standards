> **Fiction** is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, 
> portraying individuals, events, or places that are imaginary or in ways that are imaginary. 
> Fictional portrayals are thus inconsistent with fact, history, or plausibility. 
> 
> In a traditional narrow sense, fiction refers to written narratives in prose â€“ 
> often specifically novels, novellas, and short stories. 
> 
> More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, 
> including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, 
> films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games.
