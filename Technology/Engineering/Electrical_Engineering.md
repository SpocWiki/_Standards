> Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline 
> concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems 
> that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. 
> 
> It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century 
> after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, 
> and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.
>
> Electrical engineering is divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. 
> 
> Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, 
> spanning a huge number of specializations including 
> - hardware engineering, 
> - power electronics, 
> - electromagnetics and waves, 
> - microwave engineering, 
> - nanotechnology, 
> - electrochemistry, 
> - renewable energies, 
> - mechatronics/control, and 
> - electrical materials science.
>
> Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering, electronic or electrical and electronic engineering. 
> Practicing engineers may have professional certification 
> and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include 
> - the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 
> - the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), 
> - the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and 
> - the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET, formerly the IEE).
>
> Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. 
> These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. 
> The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, 
> ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.
