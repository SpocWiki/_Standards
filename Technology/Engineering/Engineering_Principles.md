## Design and System Principles

- Modularity — systems should be divided into discrete, interchangeable components.  
- Maintainability — ease with which a system can be corrected or updated.
- Scalability — designs should maintain performance as size or load increases.  
- Robustness — tolerance of variation without loss of functionality.  
- Redundancy — duplication of components to ensure reliability.  

## Computational and Control Principles

- Feedback Control — using system output to influence future input and maintain stability.  
- Automation — replacing manual operations with automated mechanisms to improve accuracy.  
- Optimization — minimizing or maximizing an objective function under constraints.  
- Abstraction — managing system complexity by separating conceptual layers.

## Process and Quality Principles

- Verification and Validation — ensuring systems meet both design specifications and user needs.  
- Lifecycle Thinking — considering creation, use, maintenance, and disposal phases.  
- Safety First — prioritizing human and environmental safety in all operations.  
- Sustainability — minimizing resource use and environmental impact.  
- Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) — ongoing **incremental enhancements** to processes and products.

## Use Bool Configuration Switches 

Use boolean Switches: 
This allows to rapidly switch between multiple voluminous configurations. 
Do NOT force the Clearing of Fields as an indication, although the readability would be better, but the maintainability is worse. 

## Anti-Patterns 

## Process-Anti-Patterns 

### Big Bang Integration 

### Monolithic Architecture 

### Disruptive Innovation 

Disruption is necessary for Quantum Leaps in Innovation, but it is not a goal in itself. 
The new Technology should be implemented as a separate Product. The double Maintenance must be tolerated for a while. 
Example: Microsoft supporting old Products for a while, but new endeavors are implemented in a new Code base, instead of destabilizing the old Code base. 
The double Maintenance is annoying, but it drastically reduces risk and increases Speed in both Processes. 

One Argument for Business Re-Engineering is [[Shakedown]].
