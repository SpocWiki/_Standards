## Design and System Principles

- Modularity — systems should be divided into discrete, interchangeable components.  
- Maintainability — ease with which a system can be corrected or updated.
- Scalability — designs should maintain performance as size or load increases.  
- Robustness — tolerance of variation without loss of functionality.  
- Redundancy — duplication of components to ensure reliability.  

## Computational and Control Principles

- Feedback Control — using system output to influence future input and maintain stability.  
- Automation — replacing manual operations with automated mechanisms to improve accuracy.  
- Optimization — minimizing or maximizing an objective function under constraints.  
- Abstraction — managing system complexity by separating conceptual layers.

## Process and Quality Principles

- Verification and Validation — ensuring systems meet both design specifications and user needs.  
- Lifecycle Thinking — considering creation, use, maintenance, and disposal phases.  
- Safety First — prioritizing human and environmental safety in all operations.  
- Sustainability — minimizing resource use and environmental impact.  
- Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) — ongoing **incremental enhancements** to processes and products.

## Use Bool Configuration Switches 

Use boolean Switches: 
This allows to rapidly switch between multiple voluminous configurations. 
Do NOT force the Clearing of Fields as an indication, although the readability would be better, but the maintainability is worse. 

## Anti-Patterns 

## Process-Anti-Patterns 

### Big Bang Integration 

### Monolithic Architecture 

### Disruptive Innovation 

Disruption is necessary for Quantum Leaps in Innovation, but it is not a goal in itself. 
The new Technology should be implemented as a separate Product. The double Maintenance must be tolerated for a while. 
Example: Microsoft supporting old Products for a while, but new endeavors are implemented in a new Code base, instead of destabilizing the old Code base. 
The double Maintenance is annoying, but it drastically reduces risk and increases Speed in both Processes.
