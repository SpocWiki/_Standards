## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Naval architecture, or naval engineering, is an engineering discipline 
> incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering 
> as applied to the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, 
> and operation of marine vessels and structures. 
> 
> Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, 
> design evaluation (classification) and calculations 
> during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. 
> 
> Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, 
> operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. 
> 
> Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified 
> (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). 
> 
> Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules 
> and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.
