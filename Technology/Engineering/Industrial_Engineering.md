> Industrial engineering (IE) is concerned with the design, improvement and installation 
> of integrated systems of people, materials, information, equipment and energy. 
> 
> It draws upon specialized knowledge and skill in the mathematical, physical, and social sciences

> Industrial engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on optimizing complex processes, systems, and organizations by improving efficiency, productivity, and quality. It combines principles from engineering, mathematics, and business to design, analyze, and manage systems that involve people, materials, information, equipment, and energy. Industrial engineers aim to reduce waste, streamline operations, and enhance overall performance across various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and service sectors.

> Industrial engineers are employed in numerous industries, such as 
> - automobile manufacturing, 
> - aerospace, 
> - healthcare, 
> - forestry, 
> - finance, 
> - leisure, and 
> - education. 
> Industrial engineering combines the physical and social sciences 
> together with engineering principles to improve processes and systems.
>
> Several industrial engineering principles are followed 
> to ensure the effective flow of systems, processes, and operations. 
> Industrial engineers work to improve quality and productivity while simultaneously cutting waste. 
> They use principles such as lean manufacturing, six sigma, information systems, process capability, and more.
>
> These principles allow the creation of new systems, processes or situations 
> for the useful coordination of labor, materials and machines. 
> 
> Depending on the subspecialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, 
> - operations research, 
> - systems engineering, 
> - manufacturing engineering, 
> - production engineering, 
> - supply chain engineering, 
> - process engineering, 
> - management science,  
> - engineering management, 
> - ergonomics or human factors engineering, 
> - safety engineering, 
> - logistics engineering,
