## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering 
> focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. 
> 
> It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise 
> to develop software systems that meet user needs.
>
> The terms programmer and coder overlap software engineer, 
> but they imply only the construction aspect of a typical software engineer workload.
>
> A software engineer applies a software development process, which involves 
> defining, implementing, testing, managing, and maintaining software systems, 
> as well as developing the software development process itself.
