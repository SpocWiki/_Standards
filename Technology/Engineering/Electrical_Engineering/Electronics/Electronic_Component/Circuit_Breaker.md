> A circuit breaker is an electrical safety device designed to protect an electrical circuit 
> from damage caused by current in excess of that which the equipment can safely carry (overcurrent). 
> 
> Its basic function is to interrupt current flow to protect equipment and to prevent fire. 
> Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, 
> a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation.  
>
> Circuit breakers are commonly installed in distribution boards.  Apart from its safety purpose, a circuit breaker is also often used as a main switch to manually disconnect ("rack out") and connect ("rack in") electrical power to a whole electrical sub-network.
>
> Circuit breakers are made in varying current ratings, from devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliances, to switchgear designed to protect high-voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Any device which protects against excessive current by automatically removing power from a faulty system, such as a circuit breaker or fuse, can be referred to as an over-current protection device (OCPD).
