> **Photodetector**s, also called photosensors, are devices that detect light 
> or other forms of electromagnetic radiation and convert it into an electrical signal. 
> 
> They are essential in a wide range of applications, 
> from digital imaging and optical communication to scientific research and industrial automation. 
> 
> Photodetectors can be classified by their mechanism of detection, 
> such as the photoelectric effect, photochemical reactions, or thermal effects, 
> or by performance metrics like spectral response. 
> 
> Common types include photodiodes, phototransistors, and photomultiplier tubes, 
> each suited to specific uses. 
> 
> Solar cells, which convert light into electricity, are also a type of photodetector.
