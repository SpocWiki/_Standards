## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In electrical engineering, a **Capacitor** is a device that stores electrical energy 
> by accumulating electric charges on two closely spaced surfaces that are insulated from each other. 
> 
> The capacitor was originally known as the condenser, 
> a term still encountered in a few compound names, such as the condenser microphone. 
> It is a passive, linear electronic component with two terminals.
>
> The utility of a capacitor depends on its capacitance. 
> While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, 
> a capacitor is a component designed specifically to add capacitance to some part of the circuit.
>
> The physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely 
> and many types of capacitor are in common use. 
> 
> Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors, 
> often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. 
> A conductor may be a foil, thin film, sintered bead of metal, or an electrolyte. 
> The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. 
> 
> Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, air, 
> and oxide layers. 
> When an electric potential difference (a voltage) is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, 
> for example when a capacitor is connected across a battery, 
> an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing a net positive charge to collect on one plate 
> and net negative charge to collect on the other plate. 
> No current actually flows through a perfect dielectric. 
> However, there is a flow of charge through the source circuit. 
> If the condition is maintained sufficiently long, the current through the source circuit ceases. 
> If a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, 
> the source experiences an ongoing current 
> due to the charging and discharging cycles of the capacitor.
>
> Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. 
> Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy, 
> although real-life capacitors do dissipate a small amount (see Non-ideal behavior).
>
> The earliest forms of capacitors were created in the 1740s, 
> when European experimenters discovered 
> that electric charge could be stored in water-filled glass jars that came to be known as Leyden jars. 
> 
> Today, capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current 
> while allowing alternating current to pass. 
> In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies. 
> In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies. 
> In electric power transmission systems, they stabilize voltage and power flow. 
> The property of energy storage in capacitors 
> was exploited as dynamic memory in early digital computers, and still is in modern DRAM.
