## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In electrical engineering, the process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from 
> complex electronic systems down to the individual transistors within an integrated circuit.  
> 
> One person can often do the design process 
> without needing a planned or structured design process for simple circuits. 
> 
> Still, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation 
> are becoming increasingly common for more complex designs.  
> 
> In integrated circuit design automation, the term "circuit design" often refers to 
> the step of the design cycle which outputs the schematics of the integrated circuit. 
> Typically this is the step between logic design and physical design.
