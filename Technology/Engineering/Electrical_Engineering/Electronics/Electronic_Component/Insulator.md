> An electrical **Insulator** is a material in which electric current does not flow freely. 
> The atoms of the insulator have tightly bound electrons which cannot readily move. 
> Other materials—semiconductors and conductors—conduct electric current more easily. 
> The property that distinguishes an insulator is its resistivity; 
> insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors. 
> The most common examples are non-metals.
>
> A perfect insulator does not exist 
> because even the materials used as insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges 
> (charge carriers) which can carry current. 
> 
> In addition, all insulators become electrically conductive 
> when a sufficiently large voltage is applied 
> that the electric field tears electrons away from the atoms. 
> This is known as electrical breakdown, 
> and the voltage at which it occurs is called the breakdown voltage of an insulator. 
> 
> Some materials such as glass, paper and PTFE, which have high resistivity, 
> are very good electrical insulators. 
> 
> A much larger class of materials, even though they may have lower bulk resistivity, are still good enough to prevent significant current from flowing at normally used voltages, and thus are employed as insulation for electrical wiring and cables. Examples include rubber-like polymers and most plastics which can be thermoset or thermoplastic in nature.

> Insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical conductors without allowing current through themselves. An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation. The term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to utility poles and transmission towers. They support the weight of the suspended wires without allowing the current to flow through the tower to ground.
