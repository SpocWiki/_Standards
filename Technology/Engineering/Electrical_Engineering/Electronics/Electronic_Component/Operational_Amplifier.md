> An operational amplifier (often op amp or opamp) 
> is a DC-coupled electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input, 
> a (usually) single-ended output, and an extremely high gain. 
> 
> Its name comes from its original use of performing mathematical operations 
> in analog computers. 
>
> By using negative feedback, an op amp circuit's characteristics 
> (e.g. its gain, input and output impedance, bandwidth, and functionality) 
> can be determined by external components 
> and have little dependence on temperature coefficients 
> or engineering tolerance in the op amp itself. 
> This flexibility has made the op amp a popular building block in analog circuits.
>
> Today, op amps are used widely in consumer, industrial, and scientific electronics. 
> Many standard integrated circuit op amps cost only a few cents; 
> however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers 
> with special performance specifications may cost over US$100. 
> 
> Op amps may be packaged as components 
> or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.
>
> The op amp is one type of differential amplifier. 
> Other differential amplifier types include the fully differential amplifier 
> (an op amp with a differential rather than single-ended output), 
> the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op amps), 
> the isolation amplifier (with galvanic isolation between input and output), 
> and negative-feedback amplifier 
> (usually built from one or more op amps and a resistive feedback network).
