# [[Memristor]] 

Memristance is charge-dependent [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance"), analog to 
[[Inductor|Inductor]], which has a currency-dependence [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance"). 

It is similar to a [[Memistor]]. 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Memristor** (a portmanteau of memory resistor) is a non-linear two-terminal electrical component 
> relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. 
> 
> It was described and named in 1971 by Leon Chua, 
> completing a theoretical quartet of fundamental electrical components 
> which also comprises the resistor, capacitor and inductor.
>
> Chua and Kang later generalized the concept to memristive systems. 
> Such a system comprises a circuit, of multiple conventional components, 
> which mimics key properties of the ideal memristor component 
> and is also commonly referred to as a memristor. 
> 
> Several such memristor system technologies have been developed, notably ReRAM.
>
> The identification of memristive properties in electronic devices has attracted controversy. 
> Experimentally, the ideal memristor has yet to be demonstrated.
