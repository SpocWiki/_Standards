> A vacuum tube, electron tube, thermionic valve (British usage), or tube (North America) 
> is a device that controls electric current flow in a high vacuum 
> between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied. 
> 
> It takes the form of an evacuated tubular envelope of glass or sometimes metal 
> containing electrodes connected to external connection pins.
>
> The type known as a thermionic tube or thermionic valve 
> utilizes thermionic emission of electrons from a hot cathode 
> for fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current rectification. 
> 
> Non-thermionic types such as vacuum phototubes 
> achieve electron emission through the photoelectric effect, 
> and are used for such purposes as the detection of light and measurement of its intensity. 
> 
> In both types the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode by the electric field in the tube.
>
> The first, and simplest, vacuum tube, the diode or Fleming valve, 
> was invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming. 
> 
> It contains only a heated electron-emitting cathode and an anode. 
> Electrons can flow in only one direction through the device: from the cathode to the anode 
> (hence the name "valve", like a device permitting one-way flow of water). 
> 
> Adding one or more control grids within the tube, creating the triode, tetrode, etc., 
> allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grids, 
> creating devices able to amplify as well as rectify electric signals. 
> Multiple grids (e.g., a heptode) allow signals applied to different electrodes to be mixed.
>
> These devices became a key component of electronic circuits 
> for the first half of the twentieth century. 
> 
> They were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, 
> sound recording and reproduction, long-distance telephone networks, 
> and analog and early digital computers. 
> 
> Although some applications had used 
> earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter and crystal detector 
> for radio or mechanical and electromechanical computers, 
> the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube made these technologies widespread and practical, 
> and created the discipline of electronics.
>
> In the 1940s, the invention of semiconductor devices made it 
> possible to produce solid-state electronic devices, which are smaller, safer, cooler, 
> and more efficient, reliable, durable, and economical than thermionic tubes. 
> 
> Beginning in the mid-1960s, thermionic tubes were being replaced by the transistor. 
> However, the cathode-ray tube (CRT), functionally an electron tube/valve 
> though not usually so named, remained in use for electronic visual displays 
> in television receivers, computer monitors, and oscilloscopes until the early 21st century.
>
> Thermionic tubes are still employed in some applications, 
> such as the magnetron used in microwave ovens, and some high-frequency amplifiers. 
> Many audio enthusiasts prefer otherwise obsolete tube/valve amplifiers 
> for the claimed "warmer" tube sound, and they are used for electric musical instruments 
> such as electric guitars for desired effects, such as "overdriving" them to achieve a certain sound or tone.
>
> Not all electronic circuit valves or electron tubes are vacuum tubes. 
> Gas-filled tubes are similar devices, but containing a gas, typically at low pressure, 
> which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.
