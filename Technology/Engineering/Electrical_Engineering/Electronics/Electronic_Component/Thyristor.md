> A **Thyristor** (combination of Greek language θύρα, meaning "door" or "valve", and transistor) 
> is a solid-state semiconductor device which can be thought of as 
> being a highly robust and switchable diode, 
> allowing the passage of current in one direction but not the other, 
> often under control of a gate electrode, that is 
> used in high power applications like inverters and radar generators. 
> 
> It usually consists of four layers of alternating P- and N-type materials. 
> It acts as a bistable switch (or a latch). 
> There are two designs, differing in what triggers the conducting state. 
> 
> In a three-lead thyristor, 
> a small current on its gate lead controls the larger current of the anode-to-cathode path. 
> 
> In a two-lead thyristor, conduction begins 
> when the potential between anode and cathode is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage). 
> 
> The thyristor continues conducting until the voltage across the device is reverse-biased 
> or the voltage is removed (by some other means), 
> or through the control gate signal on newer types.
>
> Some sources define "silicon-controlled rectifier" (SCR) and "thyristor" as synonymous. 
> Other sources define thyristors as more complex devices 
> that incorporate at least four layers of alternating N-type and P-type substrate.
>
> The first thyristor devices were released commercially in 1956. 
> 
> Because thyristors can control a large amount of power and voltage with a small device, 
> they find wide application in control of electric power, 
> ranging from light dimmers and electric motor speed control 
> to high-voltage direct-current power transmission. 
> 
> Thyristors may be used in power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc. Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the control gate signal. The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor.
>
> Unlike transistors, thyristors have a two-valued switching characteristic, meaning that a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.
