## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device 
> that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers to display information. 
> Liquid crystals do not emit light directly but instead use a backlight or reflector 
> to produce images in color or monochrome.
>
> LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) 
> or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden: 
> preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays (as in a digital clock) are all examples of devices with these displays. 
> They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, 
> while other displays have larger elements.
>
> LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. 
> 
> Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. 
> 
> LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky and less energy-efficient cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays 
> in nearly all applications since the late 2000s to the early 2010s.
>
> LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement. 
> For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight has black lettering 
> on a background that is the color of the backlight, 
> and a character negative LCD has a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight. 
>
> LCDs are not subject to screen burn-in like on CRTs. 
> However, LCDs are still susceptible to image persistence.
