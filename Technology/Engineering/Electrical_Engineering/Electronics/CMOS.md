Consumes power only during switching => much higher VLSI Integration 
but Consumption rises with Clock Speed.

> Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (**cmos**, pronounced "sea-moss") 
> is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) 
> fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical 
> pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions. 
> 
> CMOS technology is used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, 
> including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips (including CMOS BIOS), 
> and other digital logic circuits. 
> 
> CMOS technology is also used for analog circuits such as 
> image sensors (CMOS sensors), data converters, RF circuits (RF CMOS), 
> and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication. 
>
> In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Bardeen's concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. 
> 
> The CMOS process was presented by Fairchild Semiconductor's Frank Wanlass 
> and Chih-Tang Sah at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in 1963. 
> Wanlass later filed US patent 3,356,858 for CMOS circuitry and it was granted in 1967. 
> 
> RCA commercialized the technology with the trademark "COS-MOS" in the late 1960s, 
> forcing other manufacturers to find another name, leading to 
> "CMOS" becoming the standard name for the technology by the early 1970s. 
> 
> CMOS overtook NMOS logic as the dominant MOSFET fabrication process 
> for very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips in the 1980s, 
> also replacing earlier transistor–transistor logic (TTL) technology. 
> 
> CMOS has since remained the standard fabrication process 
> for MOSFET semiconductor devices in VLSI chips. 
> As of 2011, 99% of IC chips, including most digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs, 
> were fabricated using CMOS technology.
>
> Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption. 
> 
> Since one transistor of the MOSFET pair is always off, the series combination 
> draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. 
> 
> Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, 
> like NMOS logic or transistor–transistor logic (TTL), 
> which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. 
> These characteristics allow CMOS to integrate a **high density of logic functions** on a chip. 
> It was primarily for this reason 
> that CMOS became the most widely used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.
>
> The phrase "metal–oxide–semiconductor" is a reference to the physical structure of MOS field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminium was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-κ dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and smaller sizes.
