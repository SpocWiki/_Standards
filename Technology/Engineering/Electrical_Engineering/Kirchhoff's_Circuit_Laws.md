> Kirchhoff's circuit laws are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference 
> (commonly known as voltage) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits. 
> 
> They were first described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. 
> This generalized the work of Georg Ohm and preceded the work of James Clerk Maxwell. 
> Widely used in electrical engineering, they are also called Kirchhoff's rules or simply Kirchhoff's laws. 
> These laws can be applied in time and frequency domains and form the basis for network analysis.
>
> Both of Kirchhoff's laws can be understood as corollaries of Maxwell's equations 
> in the low-frequency limit. 
> 
> They are accurate for DC circuits, and for AC circuits at frequencies 
> where the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are very large compared to the circuits.
