> **Construction** is a general term meaning the art and science of forming objects, systems, or organizations. 
> It comes from the Latin word constructio (from com- "together" and struere "to pile up") 
> and Old French construction. 
> To 'construct' is a verb: the act of building, and the noun is construction: 
> how something is built or the nature of its structure.
>
> In its most widely used context, construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings, 
> infrastructure, industrial facilities, and associated activities through to the end of their life. 
> 
> It typically starts with planning, financing, and design that continues 
> until the asset is built and ready for use. 
> Construction also covers repairs and maintenance work, 
> any works to expand, extend and improve the asset, 
> and its eventual demolition, dismantling or decommissioning.
>
> The construction industry contributes significantly to many countries' gross domestic products (GDP). 
> Global expenditure on construction activities was about $4 trillion in 2012. 
> In 2022, expenditure on the construction industry exceeded $11 trillion a year, 
> equivalent to about 13 percent of global GDP. 
> This spending was forecasted to rise to around $14.8 trillion in 2030.
>
> The construction industry promotes economic development 
> and brings many non-monetary benefits to many countries, 
> but it is one of the most hazardous industries. 
> 
> For example, about 20% (1,061) of US industry fatalities in 2019 happened in construction.
