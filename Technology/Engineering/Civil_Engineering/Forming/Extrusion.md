> **Extrusion** is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile 
> by pushing material through a die of the desired cross-section. 
> 
> Its two main advantages over other manufacturing processes are 
> - its ability to create very complex cross-sections; and 
> - to work materials that are brittle, because the material encounters only compressive and shear stresses. 
> - It also creates excellent surface finish and gives considerable freedom of form in the design process.
>
> Drawing is a similar process, using the tensile strength of the material to pull it through the die. 
> It limits the amount of change that can be performed in one step, so it is limited to simpler shapes, 
> and multiple stages are usually needed. 
> Drawing is the main way to produce wire. 
> Metal bars and tubes are also often drawn.
>
> Extrusion may be continuous (theoretically producing indefinitely long material) 
> or semi-continuous (producing many pieces). 
> 
> It can be done with hot or cold material. 
> Commonly extruded materials include metals, polymers, ceramics, concrete, modelling clay, and foodstuffs. 
> Products of extrusion are generally called extrudates.
>
> Also referred to as "hole flanging", hollow cavities within extruded material 
> cannot be produced using a simple flat extrusion die, 
> because there would be no way to support the centre barrier of the die. 
> 
> Instead, the die assumes the shape of a block with depth, 
> beginning first with a shape profile that supports the center section. 
> 
> The die shape then internally changes along its length into the final shape, 
> with the suspended center pieces supported from the back of the die. 
> The material flows around the supports and fuses to create the desired closed shape.
>
> The extrusion of metals can also increase their strength.
