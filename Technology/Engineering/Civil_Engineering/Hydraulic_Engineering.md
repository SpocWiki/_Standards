## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Hydraulic engineering** as a sub-discipline of civil engineering 
> is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water and sewage. 
> 
> One feature of these systems is the extensive use of gravity as the motive force 
> to cause the movement of the fluids. 
> 
> This area of civil engineering is intimately related to 
> the design of bridges, dams, channels, canals, and levees, 
> and to both sanitary and environmental engineering.
>
> Hydraulic engineering is the application of the principles of fluid mechanics 
> to problems dealing with the collection, storage, control, transport, regulation, measurement, and use of water. 
> 
> Before beginning a hydraulic engineering project, 
> one must figure out how much water is involved. 
> 
> The hydraulic engineer is concerned with the transport of sediment by the river, 
> the interaction of the water with its alluvial boundary, and the occurrence of scour and deposition.  "The hydraulic engineer actually develops conceptual  designs for the various features which interact with water such as spillways and outlet works for dams, culverts for highways, canals and related structures for irrigation projects,  and cooling-water facilities for thermal power plants."
