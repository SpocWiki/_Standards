> A **Dome** (from Latin  domus) is an architectural element similar to the hollow upper half of a sphere. 
> There is significant overlap with the term cupola, 
> which may also refer to a dome or a structure on top of a dome. 
> The precise definition of a dome has been a matter of controversy 
> and there are a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them.
>
> A dome can rest directly upon a rotunda wall, a drum, or a system of squinches or pendentives 
> used to accommodate the transition in shape from a rectangular or square space 
> to the round or polygonal base of the dome. 
> The dome's apex may be closed or may be open in the form of an oculus, 
> which may itself be covered with a roof lantern and cupola.
>
> Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory. 
> Domes were built in ancient Mesopotamia, 
> and they have been found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese architecture, 
> as well as among a number of indigenous building traditions throughout the world. 
> 
> Dome structures were common in both Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, 
> which influenced that of the rest of Europe and Islam in the Middle Ages. 
> The domes of European Renaissance architecture spread from Italy in the early modern period, 
> while domes were frequently employed in Ottoman architecture at the same time. 
> Baroque and Neoclassical architecture took inspiration from Roman domes.
>
> Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques resulted in new dome types. 
> Domes have been constructed over the centuries from mud, 
> snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic. 
> 
> The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary, celestial, 
> and governmental traditions that have likewise altered over time. 
> 
> The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, 
> legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.
