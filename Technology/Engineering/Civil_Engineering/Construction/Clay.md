> **Clay** is a type of fine-grained natural soil  material containing clay minerals 
> (hydrous aluminium phyllosilicates, e.g. kaolinite, Al2Si2O5(OH)4). 
> Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, 
> but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, 
> such as a reddish or brownish colour from small amounts of iron oxide.
>
> Clays develop plasticity when wet but can be hardened through firing. 
> Clay is the longest-known ceramic material. 
> Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay and used it for making pottery. 
> Some of the earliest pottery shards have been dated to around 14,000 BCE, 
> and clay tablets were the first known writing medium. 
> 
> Clay is used in many modern industrial processes, such as paper making, cement production, 
> and chemical filtering. 
> 
> Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population live or work in buildings made with clay, 
> often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. 
> In agriculture, clay content is a major factor in determining land arability. 
> Clay soils are generally less suitable for crops due to poor natural drainage; 
> however, clay soils are more fertile, due to higher cation-exchange capacity.
>
> Clay is a very common substance. 
> Shale, formed largely from clay, is the most common sedimentary rock. 
> Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, 
> clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. 
> 
> Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, 
> tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. 
> Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. 
> Soils high in swelling clays (expansive clay), 
> which are clay minerals that readily expand in volume when they absorb water, 
> are a major challenge in civil engineering.
