> A **Dining room** is a room for consuming food. 
> In modern times it is usually next to the kitchen for convenience in serving, 
> though in medieval times it was often on an entirely different floor level. 
> 
> Historically the dining room is furnished with a rather large dining table and several dining chairs. 
> The most common shape is generally rectangular with two armed end chairs 
> and an even number of unarmed side chairs on the long sides.
