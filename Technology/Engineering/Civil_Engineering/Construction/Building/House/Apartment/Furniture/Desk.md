> A **Desk** or bureau is a piece of furniture with a flat table-style work surface 
> used in a school, office, home or the like for academic, professional or domestic activities 
> such as reading, writing, or using equipment such as a computer. 
> 
> Desks often have one or more drawers, compartments, or pigeonholes 
> to store items such as office supplies and papers. 
> Desks are usually made of wood or metal, although materials such as glass are sometimes seen.
>
> Some desks have the form of a table, although usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions, such as a partners desk) Some desks do not have the form of a table, for instance, an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet, and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person's lap. Since many people lean on a desk while using it, a desk must be sturdy. In most cases, people sit at a desk, either on a separate chair or a built-in chair (e.g., in some school desks). Some people use standing desks to be able to stand while using them.
