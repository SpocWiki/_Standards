> A **Kitchen** is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation 
> in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment. 
> 
> A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, 
> a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets 
> arranged according to a modular design. 
> 
> Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances. 
> The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing). The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry. The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.
>
> Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments. These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen. For example, a large restaurant may have a walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwashing machine. In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks are used in household settings as they offer ease of use for food preparation and high durability.
>
> In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws. They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law.
