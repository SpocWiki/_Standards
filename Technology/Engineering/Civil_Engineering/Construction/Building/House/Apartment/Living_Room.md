> In Western architecture, a living room, also called a lounge room (Australian English), 
> lounge (British English), sitting room (British English), or drawing room, 
> is a room for relaxing and socializing in a residential house or apartment. 
> 
> Such a room is sometimes called a front room 
> when it is near the main entrance at the front of the house. 
> 
> In large, formal homes, a sitting room is often a small private living area adjacent to a bedroom, 
> such as the Queens' Sitting Room and the Lincoln Sitting Room of the White House.
>
> In the late 19th or early 20th century, Edward Bok advocated using the term living room 
> for the room then commonly called a parlo[u]r or drawing room, 
> and is sometimes erroneously credited with inventing the term. 
> 
> It is now more frequently referring to a space to relax and unwind within a household. 
> Within different parts of the world, living rooms are designed differently and evolving, 
> but all share the same purpose, to gather users in a comfortable space.
