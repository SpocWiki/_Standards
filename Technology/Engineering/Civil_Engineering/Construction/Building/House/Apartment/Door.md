> A **Door** is a hinged or otherwise movable barrier 
> that allows ingress (entry) into and egress (exit) from an enclosure. 
> The created opening in the wall is a doorway or portal. 
> 
> A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide security 
> by controlling access to the doorway (portal). 
> Conventionally, it is a panel that fits into the doorway of a building, room, or vehicle. 
> Doors are generally made of a material suited to the door's task. 
> They are commonly attached by hinges, 
> but can move by other means, such as slides or counterbalancing.
>
> The door may be able to move in various ways (at angles away from the doorway/portal, 
> by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, 
> by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) 
> to allow or prevent ingress or egress. 
> In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. 
> But in other cases (e.g., a vehicle door) the two sides are radically different.
>
> Many doors incorporate locking mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them 
> (such as with a key). 
> 
> Doors may have devices such as knockers or doorbells 
> by which people outside announce their presence. 
> 
> Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors may have the secondary functions 
> - of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, 
> - of separating areas with different functions, 
> - of allowing light to pass into and out of a space, 
> - of controlling ventilation or air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, 
> - of dampening noise, and 
> - of blocking the spread of fire.
>
> Doors can have aesthetic, symbolic, ritualistic purposes. 
> Receiving the key to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider. 
> Doors and doorways frequently appear in literature and the arts 
> with metaphorical or allegorical import as a portent of change.
