## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Masonry** is the craft of building a structure with brick, stone, or similar material, including mortar plastering which are often laid in, bound, and pasted together by mortar. The term masonry can also refer to the building units (stone, brick, etc.) themselves.
>
> The common materials of masonry construction are bricks and building stone, rocks such as marble, granite, and limestone, cast stone, concrete blocks, glass blocks, and adobe. Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction.
>
> A person who constructs masonry is called a mason or bricklayer. These are both classified as construction trades.
