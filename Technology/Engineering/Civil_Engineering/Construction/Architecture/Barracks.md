## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Barracks** are buildings used to accommodate military personnel 
> and quasi-military personnel such as police. 
> 
> The English word originates from the 17th century via French and Italian 
> from an old Spanish word barraca 'soldier's tent', 
> but today barracks are usually permanent buildings. 
> 
> The word may apply to separate housing blocks or to complete complexes, 
> and the plural form often refers to a single structure and may be singular in construction.
>
> The main objective of barracks is to separate soldiers from the civilian population 
> and reinforce discipline, training, and esprit de corps. 
> They have been called "discipline factories for soldiers". 
> 
> Like industrial factories, some are considered to be shoddy or dull buildings, 
> although others are known for their magnificent architecture such as Collins Barracks in Dublin 
> and others in Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, or London. 
> 
> From the rough barracks of 19th-century conscript armies, 
> filled with hazing and illness and barely differentiated from the livestock pens 
> that housed the draft animals, 
> to the clean and Internet-connected barracks of modern all-volunteer militaries, 
> the word can have a variety of connotations.
