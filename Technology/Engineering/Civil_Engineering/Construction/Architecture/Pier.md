## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Pier** is a raised structure that rises above a body of water 
> and usually juts out from its shore, typically supported by piles or pillars, 
> and provides above-water access to offshore areas.  
> 
> Frequent pier uses include fishing, boat docking 
> and access for both passengers and cargo, and oceanside recreation.  
> 
> Bridges, buildings, and walkways may all be supported by architectural piers. 
> 
> Their open structure allows tides and currents to flow relatively unhindered, 
> whereas the more solid foundations of a quay 
> or the closely spaced piles of a wharf can act as a breakwater, 
> and are consequently more liable to silting. 
> 
> Piers can range in size and complexity from a simple lightweight wooden structure 
> to major structures extended over 1,600 m (5,200 ft). 
> In American English, a pier may be synonymous with a dock.
>
> Piers have been built for several purposes, 
> and because these different purposes have distinct regional variances, 
> the term pier tends to have different nuances of meaning in different parts of the world. 
> 
> Thus in North America and Australia, where many ports were, 
> until recently, built on the multiple pier model, 
> the term tends to imply a current or former cargo-handling facility. 
> 
> In contrast, in Europe, where ports more often use basins 
> and river-side quays than piers, the term is principally associated with 
> the image of a Victorian cast iron pleasure pier 
> which emerged in Great Britain during the early 19th century. 
> 
> However, the earliest piers pre-date the Victorian age.
