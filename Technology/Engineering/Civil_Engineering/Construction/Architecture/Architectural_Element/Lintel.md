## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Lintel**  or lintol is a type of beam (a horizontal structural element) 
> that spans openings such as  portals, doors, windows and fireplaces. 
> 
> It can be a decorative architectural element, or a combined ornamented/structural item. 
> In the case of windows, the bottom span is referred to as a sill, but, unlike a lintel, 
> does not serve to bear a load to ensure the integrity of the wall.
>
> Modern-day lintels may be made using prestressed concrete 
> and are also referred to as beams in beam-and-block slabs or as ribs in rib-and-block slabs. 
> 
> These prestressed concrete lintels and blocks can serve as components that are 
> packed together and propped to form a suspended-floor concrete slab.
>
> An arch functions as a curved lintel.
