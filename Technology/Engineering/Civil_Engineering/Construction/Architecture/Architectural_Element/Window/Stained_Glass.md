## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Stained glass refers to colored glass as a material or art 
> and architectural works created from it. 
> 
> Although it is traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, 
> the creations of modern stained glass artists 
> also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. 
> 
> Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term "stained glass" 
> to include domestic lead light and objets d'art created from glasswork, 
> for example in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.
>
> As a material stained glass 
> is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. 
> 
> It may then be further decorated in various ways. 
> The coloured glass may be crafted into a stained-glass window, say, 
> in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, 
> held together (traditionally) by strips of lead, called cames or calms, 
> and supported by a rigid frame. 
> 
> Painted details and yellow-coloured silver stain are often used to enhance the design. 
> The term stained glass is also applied to enamelled glass 
> in which the colors have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.
>
> Stained glass, as an art and a craft, 
> requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, 
> and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. 
> 
> A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, 
> and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. 
> 
> Many large windows have withstood the test of time 
> and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages. 
> 
> In Western Europe, together with illuminated manuscripts, 
> they constitute a major form of medieval visual art to have survived. 
> 
> In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window 
> is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside 
> or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. 
> For this reason stained-glass windows have been described as "illuminated wall decorations".
>
> The design of a window may be abstract or figurative; 
> may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; 
> may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. 
> 
> Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: 
> - within a church – episodes from the life of Christ; 
> - within a parliament building – shields of the constituencies; 
> - within a college hall – figures representing the arts and sciences; or 
> - within a home – flora, fauna, or landscape.
