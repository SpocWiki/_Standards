# [[Polymethyl_Methacrylate]] 

Radiation Coefficients in IR

|   µm | Range  | Trans% | Abs% |
| ---: | ------ | -----: | ---: |
|  0.8 | N IR   |     92 |    8 |
|  1.0 | N IR   |     90 |   10 |
|  1.5 | N IR   |     88 |   12 |
|  2.5 | N IR   |     80 |   20 |
|  3.0 | Mid IR |     10 |   90 |
|  5.0 | Mid IR |    0.5 | 99.5 |
| 10.0 | Far IR |      0 |  100 |

At Temperatures between 0 and 40°C the thermal Radiation Maximum is around 10µm and Acryl absorbs all. 

## Fastening of Panes

#### Material and Environmental Considerations

- **Pane Thickness**: 
	- 4–6 mm acrylic resists light wind (up to 50 km/h) for small areas (≤1 m²) ; 
	- 8–12 mm recommended for larger surfaces or high-wind zones (>70 km/h) 
    
- **Pane Size**: Larger panes act as levers and amplify wind force; 
  cutting into smaller sections reduces bending stress by 40–60 %.
    
- **Temperature Variation**: Acrylic expands 0.07 mm/m per °C; 
  gaps must accommodate thermal movement to avoid cracking 
    

#### Mechanical Fixation Methods

By combining the Methods below, 12mm Panes can resist Wind up to 120 km/h

##### Framing and Fastening

- **Aluminum or Steel Frames**: Encase acrylic edges in a rigid frame; provides 50–70 % more resistance to wind uplift.
    
- **Countersunk Screws with Rubber Washers**: Prevents point stress cracking; leave 2–3 mm gaps for expansion.
    
- **Bolted or Clamped Systems**: Distributes load along edges; recommended for panes larger than 1 m².
    

##### Edge Protection and Support

- **U-Channels or L-Channels**: Provide lateral stability; reduce pane deflection by 30–40 %.
    
- **Corner Brackets**: Reduce torsional stress in high-wind areas by 20–25 %.
    

##### Sealing and Windproofing

- **EPDM or Silicone Gaskets**: Absorb vibration and minor wind shocks; increases wind tolerance by up to 15–20 %.
    
- **Overlapping Joints**: Prevent wind from lifting panes; effective in outdoor façades or greenhouses.

> Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a synthetic polymer derived from methyl methacrylate. 
> 
> It is a transparent thermoplastic used as an engineering plastic. 
> PMMA is also known as acrylic and acrylic glass and by the trade names and brands 
> Crylux, Walcast, Hesalite, Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, PerClax, and Perspex, among several others. 
> 
> This plastic is often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. 
> It can also be used as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and for many other purposes.
>
> It is often technically classified as a type of glass in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance, 
> hence its occasional historical designation as acrylic glass.
