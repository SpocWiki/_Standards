It has a typical Side-Length of 10cm, so it holds 1 Liter 
and 4 different Surfaces: 

| Color | matte |  €% |
| ----- | ----: | --: |
| black |     1 | 100 |
| white |     1 |     |
| metal |     1 |     |
| metal |     0 |     |

white only reflects visible Light. it still emits a lot of IR! 
€ is the Emission Ratio
