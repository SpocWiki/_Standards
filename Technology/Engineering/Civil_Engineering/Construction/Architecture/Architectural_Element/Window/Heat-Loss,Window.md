| Type    | W/m²/K |
| ------- | -----: |
| Single  |    5.7 |
| Double  |    2.8 |
| 2+Ar+IR |    1.1 |
| 3+Ar+IR |    0.6 |
| 2+Acryl |    1.8 |

Ar = [[../../../../../../../Chemistry/Chemical_Element/Group-18-Nobel-Gases/Argon|Argon]] 
IR = [[../../../../../../../Science/Physics/Wave/Reflection|Reflection]] of IR 

For Measuring you can use a [[Leslie_Cube]] 

[[Polymethyl_Methacrylate]]
