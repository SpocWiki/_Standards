> A **Column** or pillar in architecture and structural engineering 
> is a structural element that transmits, through compression, 
> the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. 
> 
> In other words, a column is a compression member. 
> The term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) 
> with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so. 
> A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post. 
> Supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers.
>
> For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, 
> columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. 
> 
> Other compression members are often termed "columns" 
> because of the similar stress conditions. 
> 
> Columns are frequently used 
> to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. 
> 
> In architecture, "column" refers to such a structural element that 
> also has certain proportional and decorative features. 
> 
> These beautiful columns are available in a broad selection of styles and designs 
> in round tapered, round straight, or square shaft styles. 
> 
> A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; 
> many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall. 
> 
> A long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.
