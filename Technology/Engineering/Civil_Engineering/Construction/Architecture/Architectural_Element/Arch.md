> An **Arch** is a curved vertical structure spanning an open space underneath it. 
> 
> Arches may support the load above them, or they may perform a purely decorative role. 
> 
> As a decorative element, the arch dates back to the 4th millennium BC, 
> but structural load-bearing arches became popular 
> only after their adoption by the Ancient Romans in the 4th century BC.
>
> Arch-like structures can be horizontal, like an arch dam 
> that withstands the horizontal hydrostatic pressure load. 
> 
> Arches are normally used as supports for many types of vaults, 
> with the barrel vault in particular being a continuous arch. 
> Extensive use of arches and vaults characterizes an arcuated construction, 
> as opposed to the trabeated system, where, like in the architectures of 
> ancient Greece, China, and Japan (as well as the modern steel-framed technique), 
> posts and [[Beam(Structure)|Beam]]s dominate. 
>
> Arches had several advantages over the [[Lintel]], especially in the masonry construction: 
> with the same amount of material it can have larger span, carry more weight, 
> and can be made from smaller and thus more manageable pieces. 
> 
> Their role in construction was diminished in the middle of the 19th century 
> with introduction of the wrought iron (and later steel): 
> the high tensile strength of these new materials made long lintels possible.
