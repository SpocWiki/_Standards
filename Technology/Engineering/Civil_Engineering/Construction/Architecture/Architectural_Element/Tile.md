> **Tile**s are usually thin, square or rectangular coverings manufactured from 
> hard-wearing material such as ceramic, stone, metal, baked clay, or even glass. 
> 
> They are generally fixed in place in an array to cover roofs, floors, walls, edges, 
> or other objects such as tabletops.  
> 
> Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from 
> lightweight materials such as perlite, wood, and mineral wool, typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see tile-based game). The word is derived from the French word tuile, which is, in turn, from the Latin word tegula, meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.

> Tiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or mosaics. Tiles are most often made of ceramic, typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, concrete and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.
>
> Global production of ceramic tiles, excluding roof tiles, was estimated to be 12.7 billion m2 in 2019.
