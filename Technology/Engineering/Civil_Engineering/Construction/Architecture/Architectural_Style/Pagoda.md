## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Pagoda** is a tiered tower with multiple eaves, common in Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, India, China, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other parts of Asia. 
> 
> Most pagodas were built to have a religious function, most often Buddhist, 
> but sometimes Taoist or Hindu, and were often in or near viharas. 
> 
> The pagoda traces its origins to the stupa, while its design was developed in Nepal's Kathmandu valley. 
> 
> Chinese pagodas (Chinese: 塔; pinyin: Tǎ) are a traditional part of Chinese architecture. 
> In addition to religious use, since ancient times 
> Chinese pagodas have been valued for the spectacular views they offer, 
> and many classical poems attest to the joy of scaling pagodas.
>
> The oldest and tallest pagodas were made of wood, 
> but most that survived were made of brick or stone. 
> 
> Some are solid with no interior. 
> Hollow pagodas have no higher floors or rooms, 
> but the interior often contains an altar or a smaller pagoda, 
> as well as a series of staircases for visitors to climb 
> and see the view from an opening on one side of each tier. 
> Most have between three and 13 tiers (almost always an odd number) 
> and the classic gradual tiered eaves.
>
> In some countries, the term may refer to other religious structures. 
> In Vietnam and Cambodia, due to French translation, 
> the English term pagoda more generically refers to a place of worship, 
> although pagoda is not an accurate word for a Buddhist vihāra. 
> 
> The architectural structure of the stupa has spread across Asia, 
> taking on diverse forms specific to each region. 
> 
> Many Philippine bell towers are highly influenced by pagodas 
> through Chinese workers hired by the Spaniards.
