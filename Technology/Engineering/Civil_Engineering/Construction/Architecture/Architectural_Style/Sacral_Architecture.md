## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Sacral architecture (also known as sacred architecture or religious architecture) 
> is a religious architectural practice 
> concerned with the design and construction of places of worship or sacred 
> or intentional space, such as churches, mosques, stupas, synagogues, and temples. 
> 
> Many cultures devoted considerable resources 
> to their sacred architecture and places of worship. 
> 
> Religious and sacred spaces are amongst the most impressive 
> and permanent monolithic buildings created by humanity. 
> 
> Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy 
> may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.
>
> Sacred, religious and holy structures often evolved over centuries 
> and were the largest buildings in the world, prior to the modern skyscraper. 
> 
> While the various styles employed in sacred architecture 
> sometimes reflected trends in other structures, these styles also remained 
> unique from the contemporary architecture used in other structures. 
> 
> With the rise of Christianity and Islam, 
> religious buildings increasingly became centres of worship, prayer and meditation.
>
> The Western scholarly discipline of the history of architecture itself 
> closely follows the history of religious architecture from ancient times 
> until the Baroque period, at least. 
> 
> Sacred geometry, iconography, and the use of sophisticated semiotics 
> such as signs, symbols and religious motifs are endemic to sacred architecture.
