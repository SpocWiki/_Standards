> Antoni Gaudí i Cornet ( gow-DEE,  GOW-dee; Catalan: [ənˈtɔni ɣəwˈði]; 25 June 1852 – 10 June 1926) 
> was a Catalan architect and designer from Spain, 
> widely known as the greatest exponent of Catalan Modernisme. 
> Gaudí's works have a sui generis style, with most located in Barcelona, 
> including his main work, the Sagrada Família church.
>
> Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. 
> He considered every detail of his creations and combined crafts such as ceramics, 
> stained glass, wrought ironwork forging, and carpentry. 
> He introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, 
> such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces.
>
> Influenced by neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, 
> Gaudí became part of the Modernista movement, 
> which peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
> His work eventually transcended mainstream Modernisme, 
> developing into a unique style inspired by natural forms. 
> Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans, preferring to create three-dimensional scale models 
> and mold the details as he conceived them.
>
> Gaudí's work enjoys global admiration and ongoing study. 
> His masterpiece, the still-incomplete Sagrada Família, is the most-visited monument in Spain. 
> Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
>
> Gaudí's Catholic faith intensified throughout his life, 
> and religious imagery appears in many of his works. 
> This earned him the nickname "God's Architect". 
> His cause for canonization was opened in the Archdiocese of Barcelona in 2003. 
> Pope Francis authorised Gaudi's declaration as Venerable in April 2025.
