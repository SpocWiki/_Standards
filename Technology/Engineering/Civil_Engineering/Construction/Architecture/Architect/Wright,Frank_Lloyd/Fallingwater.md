> **Fallingwater** is a house museum in Stewart Township 
> in the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, United States. 
> 
> Designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, it is built partly over a waterfall on the Bear Run stream. 
> The three-story residence was developed as a weekend retreat for Liliane and Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., 
> the owner of Kaufmann's Department Store in Pittsburgh. 
> 
> The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (WPC), 
> which has operated Fallingwater as a tourist attraction since 1963, 
> maintains 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) surrounding the house. 
>
> Edgar Kaufmann Sr. had established a summer retreat at Bear Run for his employees by 1916. 
> When employees stopped using the retreat, the Kaufmanns bought the site in July 1933 
> and hired Wright to design the house in 1934. 
> 
> Several structural issues arose during the house's construction, 
> including cracked concrete and sagging terraces. 
> 
> The Kaufmanns began using the house in 1937 
> and hired Wright to design a guest wing, which was finished in 1939. 
> 
> Edgar Kaufmann Jr., the Kaufmanns' son, continued to use the house after his parents' deaths. 
> After the WPC took over, it began hosting tours of the house in July 1964 
> and built a visitor center in 1979. 
> The house was renovated in the late 1990s and early 2000s 
> to remedy severe structural defects, including sagging terraces and poor drainage.
>
> The house includes multiple outdoor terraces,  which are cantilevered, 
> extending outward from a chimney, without support at the opposite end. 
> Fallingwater is made of locally–quarried stone, reinforced concrete, steel, and plate glass. 
> The first story contains the main entrance, the living room, two outdoor terraces, and the kitchen. 
> There are four bedrooms (including a study) and additional terraces on the upper stories. 
> Wright designed most of the house's built-in furniture. 
> 
> Many pieces of art are placed throughout the house, including textiles and Tiffany glass. 
> Above the main house is a guest wing with a carport and servants' quarters.
>
> Fallingwater has received extensive architectural commentary over the years, 
> and it was one of the world's most discussed modern–style structures by the 1960s. 
> The house has been the subject of books, magazine articles, films, and other media works over the years. 
> Fallingwater is designated as a National Historic Landmark, 
> and it is one of eight buildings in "The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright", 
> a World Heritage Site.
