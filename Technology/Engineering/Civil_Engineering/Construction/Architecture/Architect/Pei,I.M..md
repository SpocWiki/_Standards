> Ieoh Ming Pei  ( YOH ming PAY; Chinese: 貝聿銘; pinyin: Bèi Yùmíng; April 26, 1917 – May 16, 2019) 
> was a Chinese-American architect. 
> 
> Born in Guangzhou into a Chinese family, 
> Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at Suzhou, 
> the traditional retreat of the scholar-gentry to which his family belonged. 
> In 1935, he moved to the United States 
> and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's architecture school, 
> but quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
> Unhappy with the focus on Beaux-Arts architecture at both schools, 
> he spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially Le Corbusier.
>
> After graduating from MIT, Pei enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) 
> where he befriended faculty members Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, 
> both of whom had formerly taught at the Bauhaus. 
>
> Beginning in 1948, Pei worked as an in-house architect 
> for New York City real estate developer William Zeckendorf. 
> In 1955, he established an independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates. 
> In 1966, the firm was reorganized as I. M. Pei & Partners, 
> and in 1989 reorganized as Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. 
> 
> Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, 
> he worked as an architectural consultant primarily with his sons' architectural firm Pei Partnership Architects.
>
> Pei's first major recognition came with the Mesa Laboratory 
> at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado 
> (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). 
> 
> His new stature led to his selection as chief architect 
> for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts. 
> 
> He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. 
> 
> He returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at Fragrant Hills 
> and, fifteen years later, designed Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong. 
> In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy 
> when he designed a glass-and-steel pyramid for the Louvre in Paris. 
> 
> He designed the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, 
> the Miho Museum in Japan, Shigaraki, near Kyoto, and the chapel of the junior and high school: 
> MIHO Institute of Aesthetics, the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou, Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar, 
> and the Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art in Luxembourg.
>
> Pei won prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the AIA Gold Medal in 1979, 
> the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture in 1989, 
> and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in 2003. 
> In 1983, he won the Pritzker Prize, which is sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.
