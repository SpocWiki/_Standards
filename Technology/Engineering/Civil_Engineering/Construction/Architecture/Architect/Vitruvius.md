> **Vitruvius** (vi-TROO-vee-əs; Latin: [wɪˈtruːwi.ʊs]; c. 80–70 BC – after c. 15 BC) 
> was a Roman architect and engineer during the 1st century BC, 
> known for his multi-volume work titled De architectura. 
> 
> As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, 
> it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, 
> as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture. 
> It is not clear to what extent his contemporaries regarded his book as original or important.
>
> He states that all buildings should have three attributes: 
> firmitas, utilitas, and venustas ("strength", "utility", and "beauty"), 
> principles reflected in much Ancient Roman architecture. 
> 
> His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body 
> led to the famous Renaissance drawing of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci.
>
> Little is known about Vitruvius' life, but by his own description 
> he served as an artilleryman, the third class of arms in the Roman military offices. 
> He probably served as a senior officer of artillery 
> in charge of doctores ballistarum (artillery experts) 
> and libratores who actually operated the machines. 
> 
> As an army engineer he specialized in the construction of ballista 
> and scorpio artillery war machines for sieges. 
> It is possible that Vitruvius served with Julius Caesar's chief engineer Lucius Cornelius Balbus.
>
> Vitruvius' De architectura was well-known and widely copied in the Middle Ages 
> and survives in many dozens of manuscripts, though 
> in 1414 it was "rediscovered" by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini 
> in the library of Saint Gall Abbey. 
> 
> Leon Battista Alberti published it in his seminal treatise on architecture, 
> De re aedificatoria (c. 1450). 
> 
> The first known Latin printed edition was by Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in Rome in 1486. 
> Translations followed in Italian, French, English, German, Spanish, 
> and several other languages. 
> 
> Though any original illustrations have been lost, 
> the first illustrated edition was published in Venice in 1511 by Fra Giovanni Giocondo, 
> with woodcut illustrations based on descriptions in the text. 
> 
> Bramante, Michelangelo, Palladio, Vignola and earlier architects 
> are known to have studied the work of Vitruvius, 
> and consequently it has had a significant impact on the architecture of many European countries.
