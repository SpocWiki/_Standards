## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A tower block, high-rise, apartment tower, residential tower, apartment block, 
> block of flats, or office tower is a tall building, as opposed to a low-rise building 
> and is defined differently in terms of height depending on the jurisdiction. 
> It is used as a residential or office building, or has other functions, 
> including hotel, retail, or with multiple purposes combined. 
> 
> Residential high-rise buildings are also known in some varieties of English, 
> such as British English, as tower blocks and may be referred to as MDUs, 
> standing for multi-dwelling units. 
> A very tall high-rise building is referred to as a skyscraper.
>
> High-rise buildings became possible to construct with the invention of the elevator (lift) 
> and with less expensive, more abundant building materials. 
> The materials used for the structural system of high-rise buildings 
> are reinforced concrete and steel. 
> 
> Most North American–style skyscrapers have a steel frame, 
> while residential blocks are usually constructed of concrete. 
> There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper, 
> although a building with forty or more stories and taller than 150 metres (490 ft) 
> is generally considered a skyscraper.
>
> High-rise structures pose particular design challenges 
> for structural and geotechnical engineers, 
> particularly if situated in a seismically active region 
> or if the underlying soils have geotechnical risk factors 
> such as high compressibility or bay mud. 
> 
> They also pose serious challenges to firefighters during emergencies in high-rise structures. 
> New and old building design, building systems such as the building standpipe system, 
> HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), fire sprinkler systems, 
> and other things such as stairwell and elevator evacuations pose significant problems. 
> 
> Studies are often required to ensure that pedestrian wind comfort 
> and wind danger concerns are addressed. 
> In order to allow less wind exposure, to transmit more daylight to the ground 
> and to appear more slender, many high-rises have a design with setbacks.
>
> Apartment buildings have technical and economic advantages 
> in areas of high population density, 
> and have become a distinctive feature of housing accommodation 
> in virtually all densely populated urban areas around the world. 
> 
> In contrast with low-rise and single-family houses, 
> apartment blocks accommodate more inhabitants per unit of area of land 
> and decrease the cost of municipal infrastructure.
