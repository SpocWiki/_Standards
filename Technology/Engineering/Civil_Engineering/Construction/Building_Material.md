> Building material is material used for construction. 
> Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, rocks, sand, wood, 
> and even twigs and leaves, have been used 
> to construct buildings and other structures, like bridges. 
> 
> Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, 
> some more and some less synthetic. 
> The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry in many countries 
> and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, 
> such as carpentry, insulation, plumbing, and roofing work. 
> They provide the make-up of habitats and structures including homes.
