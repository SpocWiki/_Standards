## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **shelter** is an architectural structure or natural formation (or a combination of the two) 
> providing protection from the local environment. 
> 
> A shelter can serve as a home or be provided by a residential institution. 
> It can be understood as both a temporary and a permanent structure. 
> 
> In the American Counterculture of the 1960s, the concept of "Shelter" intervenes as 
> one of the key concepts of the Whole Earth Catalog, 
> and expresses an alternative to the modes of teaching architecture practiced in American academies.
>
> In the context of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, shelter holds a crucial position 
> as one of the fundamental human necessities, complementing other 
> physiological imperatives such as the need for "air, water, food, rest, clothing, and reproduction."
