## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The strength of materials is determined using 
> various methods of calculating the stresses and strains in structural members, 
> such as beams, columns, and shafts. 
> 
> The methods employed to predict the response of a structure under loading 
> and its susceptibility to various failure modes 
> takes into account the properties of the materials such as its yield strength, 
> ultimate strength, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio. 
> 
> In addition, the mechanical element's macroscopic properties 
> (geometric properties) such as its length, width, thickness, boundary constraints 
> and abrupt changes in geometry such as holes are considered.
>
> The theory began with the consideration of 
> the behavior of 1D and 2D members of structures, 
> whose states of stress can be approximated as two dimensional, 
> and was then generalized to three dimensions 
> to develop a more complete theory of the elastic and plastic behavior of materials. 
> 
> An important founding pioneer in mechanics of materials was Stephen Timoshenko.
