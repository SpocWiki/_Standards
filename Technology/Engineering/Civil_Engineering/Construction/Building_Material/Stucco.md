> **Stucco** or render is a construction material made of aggregates, a binder, and water. 
> 
> Stucco is applied wet and hardens to a very dense solid. 
> It is used as a decorative coating for walls and ceilings, exterior walls, 
> and as a sculptural and artistic material in architecture. 
> 
> Stucco can be applied on construction materials such as metal, expanded metal lath, concrete, cinder block, or clay brick and adobe for decorative and structural purposes.
>
> In English, "stucco" sometimes refers to a coating for the outside of a building and "plaster" to a coating for interiors. As described below, however, the materials themselves often have little or no difference. Other European languages, notably Italian, do not have the same distinction: In Italian, stucco means plaster, and serves for both.
