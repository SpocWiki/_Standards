## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Concrete** is a composite material composed of aggregate 
> bound together with a fluid cement that cures to a solid over time. 
> It is the second-most-used substance (after water), 
> the most–widely used building material, 
> and the most-manufactured material in the world.
>
> When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water, 
> the mixture forms a fluid slurry that can be poured and molded into shape. 
> The cement reacts with the water through a process called hydration, 
> which hardens it after several hours to form a solid matrix 
> that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material with various uses. 
> 
> This time allows concrete to not only be cast in forms, 
> but also to have a variety of tooled processes performed. 
> 
> The hydration process is exothermic, 
> which means that ambient temperature plays a significant role in how long it takes concrete to set. 
> Often, additives (such as pozzolans or superplasticizers) are included in the mixture 
> to improve the physical properties of the wet mix, delay or accelerate the curing time, 
> or otherwise modify the finished material. 
> 
> Most structural concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as steel rebar) 
> embedded to provide tensile strength, yielding reinforced concrete.
>
> Before the invention of Portland cement in the early 1800s, 
> lime-based cement binders, such as lime putty, were often used. 
> 
> The overwhelming majority of concretes are produced using Portland cement, 
> but sometimes with other hydraulic cements, such as calcium aluminate cement. 
> Many other non-cementitious types of concrete exist 
> with other methods of binding aggregate together, 
> including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder, which is frequently used for road surfaces, 
> and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder.
>
> Concrete is distinct from mortar. 
> Whereas concrete is itself a building material, 
> and contains both coarse (large) and fine (small) aggregate particles, 
> mortar contains only fine aggregates and is mainly used as a bonding agent 
> to hold bricks, tiles and other masonry units together. 
> 
> Grout is another material associated with concrete and cement. 
> It also does not contain coarse aggregates and is usually either pourable or thixotropic, 
> and is used to fill gaps between masonry components 
> or coarse aggregate which has already been put in place. 
> Some methods of concrete manufacture and repair 
> involve pumping grout into the gaps to make up a solid mass in situ.
