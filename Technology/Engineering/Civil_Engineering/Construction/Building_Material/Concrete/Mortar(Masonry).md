> Mortar  is a workable paste 
> which hardens to bind building blocks such as stones, bricks, and concrete masonry units, 
> to fill and seal the irregular gaps between them, spread the weight of them evenly, 
> and sometimes to add decorative colours or patterns to masonry walls. 
> 
> In its broadest sense, mortar includes pitch, asphalt, and soft clay, 
> as those used between bricks, as well as cement mortar. 
> The word "mortar" comes from the Old French word mortier, 
> "builder's mortar, plaster; bowl for mixing." 
>
> Cement mortar becomes hard when it cures, resulting in a rigid aggregate structure; 
> however, the mortar functions as a weaker component than the building blocks 
> and serves as the sacrificial element in the masonry, 
> because mortar is easier and less expensive to repair than the building blocks. 
> 
> Bricklayers typically make mortars using a mixture of sand, a binder, and water. 
> The most common binder since the early 20th century is Portland cement, 
> but the ancient binder lime (producing lime mortar) is still used in some specialty new construction. 
> Lime, lime mortar, and gypsum in the form of plaster of Paris 
> are used particularly in the repair and repointing of historic buildings and structures, 
> so that the repair materials will be similar in performance and appearance to the original materials. 
> 
> Several types of cement mortars and additives exist.
