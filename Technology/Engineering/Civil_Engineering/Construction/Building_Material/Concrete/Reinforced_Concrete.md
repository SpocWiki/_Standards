## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Reinforced concrete, also called ferroconcrete or ferro-concrete, 
> is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility 
> are compensated for by the inclusion of reinforcement 
> having higher tensile strength or ductility. 
> 
> The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars 
> (known as rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. 
> 
> However, post-tensioning is also employed as a technique to reinforce the concrete. 
> 
> In terms of volume used annually, it is one of the most common engineering materials. 
> In corrosion engineering terms, when designed correctly, 
> the alkalinity of the concrete protects the steel rebar from corrosion.
