> The **Three Gorges Dam** (simplified Chinese: 三峡大坝; traditional : 三峽大壩; pinyin: Sānxiá Dàbà) 
> is a hydroelectric gravity dam that spans the Yangtze River 
> near Sandouping in Yiling District, Yichang, Hubei province, central China, 
> downstream of the Three Gorges. 
> 
> The world's largest power station by installed capacity (22,500 MW), 
> the Three Gorges Dam generates 95±20 TWh of electricity per year on average, 
> depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin. 
> After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam's produced nearly 112 TWh in a year, 
> breaking the previous world record of ~103 TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.
>
> The dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant became fully operational in 2012, 
> when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. 
> The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015.
>
> Each of the main water turbines, state-of-the-art at their installation, 
> has a capacity of 700 MW. 
> 
> Combining the capacity of the dam's 32 main turbines 
> with the two smaller generators (50 MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, 
> the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500 MW 
> with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. 
>
> The dam increases the Yangtze River's shipping capacity 
> and reduces the likelihood of the sort of flooding downstream 
> that have killed millions of people on the Yangtze Plain. 
> 
> As a result, the Chinese government regards the project as 
> a monumental social and economic success. 
>
> However, it is controversial domestically and abroad. 
> The dam's construction displaced more than 31 million people 
> and inundated ancient and culturally significant sites. 
> 
> In operation, the dam has caused some ecological changes, 
> including an increased risk of landslides.
