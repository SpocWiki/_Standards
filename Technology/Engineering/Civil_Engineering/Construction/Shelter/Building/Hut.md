> A **Hut** is a small dwelling, which may be constructed of various local materials. 
> Huts are a type of vernacular architecture because they are built of readily available materials 
> such as wood, snow, stone, grass, palm leaves, branches, clay, hides, fabric, or mud 
> using techniques passed down through the generations.
>
> The construction of a hut is generally less complex than that of a [[House|House]]  
> (durable, well-built dwelling) but more so than that of a shelter (place of refuge or safety) such as a tent and is used as temporary or seasonal shelter or as a permanent dwelling in some indigenous societies.
>
> Huts exist in practically all nomadic cultures. Some huts are transportable and can stand most conditions of weather.
