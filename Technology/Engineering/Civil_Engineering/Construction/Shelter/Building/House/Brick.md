## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Brick** is a type of construction material used to build walls, pavements 
> and other elements in masonry construction. 
> 
> Properly, the term brick denotes a unit primarily composed of clay. 
> But is now also used informally to denote building units made of other materials 
> or other chemically cured construction blocks. 
> 
> Bricks can be joined using mortar, adhesives or by interlocking. 
> Bricks are usually produced at brickworks in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes 
> which vary with region, and are produced in bulk quantities.
>
> Block is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit 
> composed of clay or concrete, but is usually larger than a brick. 
> Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from expanded clay aggregate.
>
> Fired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials, 
> sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since c. 4000 BC. 
> Air-dried bricks, also known as mudbricks, have a history older than fired bricks, 
> and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.
>
> Bricks are laid in courses and numerous patterns known as bonds, 
> collectively known as brickwork, 
> and may be laid in various kinds of mortar to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.
