A FloorPlan is an explicit representation of a collection of similar accommodations, 
allowing the provision of common information (room counts, sizes, layout diagrams) and offers for rental or sale. 

In typical use, some [[ApartmentComplex]] has an [[accommodationFloorPlan]] which is a [[FloorPlan]]. 

A FloorPlan is always in the context of a particular place, 
either a larger [[ApartmentComplex]] or a single[[../../../../../../../Earth/Geography/Place/Accommodation/Apartment]]]. 

The visual/spatial aspects of a floor plan (i.e. room layout, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_plan">see wikipedia</a>) 
can be indicated using [[image]].
