> A **Warehouse** is a building for storing goods. 
> Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc. 
> They are usually large plain buildings in industrial parks 
> on the outskirts of cities, towns, or villages.
>
> Warehouses usually have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks. 
> Sometimes warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods 
> directly from railways, airports, or seaports. 
> 
> They often have cranes and forklifts for moving goods, 
> which are usually placed on ISO standard pallets and then loaded into pallet racks. 
> Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, spare parts, 
> components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing, and production.
>
> In India and Hong Kong, a warehouse may be referred to as a godown.
