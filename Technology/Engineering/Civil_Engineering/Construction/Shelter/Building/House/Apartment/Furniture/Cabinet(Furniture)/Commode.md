## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Commode** is any of many pieces of furniture. 
> The Oxford English Dictionary has multiple meanings of "commode". 
> 
> The first relevant definition reads: "A **piece of furniture** with drawers and shelves; 
> - in the bedroom, a sort of elaborate chest of drawers (so in French); 
> - in the drawing room, a large (and generally old-fashioned) kind of chiffonier." 
> The drawing room is itself a  term for a formal reception room, 
> and a chiffonier is, in this sense, a small sideboard dating from the early 19th century.
>
> Another meaning attested is a **washstand**, a piece of furniture equipped with basin, jug, and towel rail, 
> and often with space to store the chamber pot behind closed doors. 
> A washstand in the bedroom pre-dates indoor bathrooms and running water.
>
> In British English, "commode" is the standard term for a commode chair, often on wheels, 
> **enclosing a chamber pot**—as used in hospitals and assisted living homes. 
> In the United States, a "commode" is now a colloquial synonym for a **flush toilet**.
>
> The word commode comes from the French word for "convenient" or "suitable", 
> which in turn comes from the Latin adjective commodus, with similar meanings.
