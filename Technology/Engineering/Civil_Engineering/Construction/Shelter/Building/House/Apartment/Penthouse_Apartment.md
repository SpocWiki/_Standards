## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A penthouse is an apartment or unit traditionally on the highest floor of an apartment building, condominium, hotel, or tower. 
> 
> Penthouses are typically differentiated from other apartments by luxury features. 
> The term 'penthouse' originally referred, and sometimes still does refer, to 
> a separate smaller 'house' that was constructed on the roof of an apartment building. 
> 
> Architecturally it refers specifically to a structure on the roof of a building 
> that is set back from its outer walls. These structures do not have to occupy the entire roof deck. 
> 
> Recently, luxury high rise apartment buildings have begun 
> to designate multiple units on the entire top residential floor or multiple higher residential floors 
> including the top floor as **Penthouse apartment**s, 
> and outfit them to include ultra-luxury fixtures, finishes, and designs 
> which are different from all other residential floors of the building. 
> 
> These penthouse apartments are not typically set back from the building's outer walls, 
> but are instead flush with the rest of the building and simply differ in size, luxury, and consequently price. 
> 
> High-rise buildings can also have structures known as mechanical penthouses 
> that enclose machinery or equipment such as the drum mechanisms for an elevator.
