> A **Wardrobe**, also called armoire or almirah, is a standing closet used for storing clothes. 
> The earliest wardrobe was a chest, 
> and it was not until some degree of luxury was attained in regal palaces 
> and the castles of powerful nobles that separate accommodation was provided for the apparel. 
> 
> The name of wardrobe was then given to a room 
> in which the wall-space was filled with closets and lockers, 
> the drawer being a comparatively modern invention. 
> 
> From these cupboards and lockers the modern wardrobe, with its hanging spaces, sliding shelves and drawers, evolved slowly.
>
> Throughout the chronological changes in the form of the enclosure, 
> it has more or less retained its preset function as a place to retain a king's robe. 
> 
> The word has gained coinage over successive generations as 
> an independent store for among others, preserving precious items for a ruler like gold, 
> well highlighted in King Edward I's times. 
> 
> It is also a simple patio where clothes are hung from metal bars 
> or tucked inside utility racks running from up to down. 
> 
> The modern wardrobe differs in one respect from the historical one for its triple partitioning: 
> - there are two linear compartments on either side with shelves 
> - as well as a middle space made up of hanging pegs and drawers, 
> the latter being a latter-day addition, 
> besides a clothes' press in the higher central space on level with a person's chest.
>
> Additionally, an armoire is a wardrobe that is wider than a grown adult's arm span, 
> while a wardrobe is smaller.
