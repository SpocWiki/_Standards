> A **Carpet** is a textile floor covering typically consisting of 
> an upper layer of pile attached to a backing. 
> The pile was traditionally made from wool, 
> but since the 20th century synthetic fibres such as polypropylene, nylon, 
> and polyester have often been used, as these fibres are less expensive than wool. 
> The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. 
> The term carpet is often used in a similar context to the term rug, 
> but rugs are mostly considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor.
>
> These include insulating a person's feet from cold tile or concrete floors, 
> making a room more comfortable for sitting (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), 
> reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings), 
> and adding decoration or color to a room. 
> 
> Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibres. 
> Carpets can be decorated with many different patterns and motifs. 
> Today, a wide range of carpets and rugs are available at various price and quality levels, 
> from inexpensive, mass-produced synthetic carpets used in commercial buildings 
> to costly hand-knotted wool rugs found in private residences.
>
> Carpets can be produced through various methods, including 
> weaving, needle felting, hand-knotting (as seen in oriental rugs), 
> tufting (where pile is injected into a backing material), flat weaving, 
> hooking (by pulling wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric), or embroidering. 
> 
> Carpet is commonly made in widths of 12 or 15 feet (3.7 or 4.6 m) in the United States 
> and 4 or 5 m (13 or 16 ft) in Europe. 
> Since the 19th and 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, 
> different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape 
> (formerly it was sewn together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay (pad) using nails, 
> tack strips (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal stair rods. 
> 
> Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or mats, which are loose-laid floor coverings, 
> as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a significantly greater area.
