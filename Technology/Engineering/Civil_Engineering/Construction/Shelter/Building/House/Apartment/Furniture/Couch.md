> A **Couch**, also known as a sofa, settee, chesterfield, or davenport, 
> is a cushioned piece of furniture that can seat multiple people. 
> 
> It is commonly found in the form of a bench with upholstered armrests 
> and is often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows. 
> 
> Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping. 
> In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den, or lounge. 
> They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings 
> such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars. 
> 
> Couches can vary in size, color, and design.
