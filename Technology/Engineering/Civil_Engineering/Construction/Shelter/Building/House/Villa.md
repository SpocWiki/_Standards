## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Villa** is a type of house that was 
> originally an ancient Roman upper class country house 
> that provided an escape from urban life. 
> 
> Since its origins in the Roman villa, 
> the idea and function of a villa have evolved considerably.  
> 
> After the fall of the Roman Republic, villas became small farming compounds, 
> which were increasingly fortified in Late Antiquity, 
> sometimes transferred to the Church for reuse as a monastery. 
> 
> They gradually re-evolved through the Middle Ages 
> into elegant upper-class country homes.  
> 
> In the early modern period, any comfortable detached house 
> with a garden near a city or town was likely to be described as a villa; 
> most surviving villas have now been engulfed by suburbia.  
> 
> In modern parlance, "villa" can refer to various types and sizes of residences, 
> ranging from the suburban semi-detached double villa to, 
> in some countries, especially around the Mediterranean, 
> residences of above average size in the countryside.
