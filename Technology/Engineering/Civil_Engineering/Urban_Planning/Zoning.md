## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In urban planning, **Zoning** is a method in which a municipality 
> or other tier of government divides land into land-use and building "zones", 
> each of which has a set of regulations for new development 
> that differs from other zones. 
> 
> Zones may be defined for a single use (e.g. residential, industrial), 
> they may combine several compatible activities by use, 
> or in the case of form-based zoning, the differing regulations may 
> govern the density, size and shape of allowed buildings whatever their use. 
> 
> The planning rules for each zone determine whether planning permission for a given development may be granted. Zoning may specify a variety of outright and conditional uses of land. It may indicate the size and dimensions of lots that land may be subdivided into, or the form and scale of buildings. These guidelines are set in order to guide urban growth and development.
>
> Zoning is the most common regulatory urban planning method used by local governments in developed countries. Exceptions include the United Kingdom and the city of Houston, Texas.
>
> Most zoning systems have a procedure for granting variances (exceptions to the zoning rules), usually because of some perceived hardship caused by the particular nature of the property in question.
