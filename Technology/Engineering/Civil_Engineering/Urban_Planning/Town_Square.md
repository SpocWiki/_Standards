## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Town Square** (or public square, urban square, city square or simply square), 
> also called a plaza or piazza, is an open public space 
> commonly found in the heart of a traditional town or city, 
> and which is used for community gatherings. 
> 
> Related concepts are the civic center, the market square and the village green.
>
> Most squares are hardscapes suitable for open markets, concerts, political rallies, 
> and other events that require firm ground. 
> They are not necessarily a true geometric square.
>
> Being centrally located, town squares are usually surrounded by small shops such as 
> bakeries, meat markets, cheese stores, and clothing stores. 
> At their center is often a well, monument, statue or other feature. 
> Those with fountains are sometimes called fountain squares.
>
> The term "town square" (especially via the term "public square") 
> is synonymous with the politics of many cultures, 
> and the names of a certain town squares, such as the Euromaidan or Red Square, 
> have become symbolic of specific political events throughout history.
