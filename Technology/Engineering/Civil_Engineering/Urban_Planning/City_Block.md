> A city block, residential block, urban block, houseblock, or simply block 
> is a central element of urban planning and urban design.
>
> In a city with a grid system, the block is the smallest group of buildings that is surrounded by streets. 
> 
> City blocks are the space for buildings within the street pattern of a city, 
> and form the basic unit of a city's urban fabric. 
> City blocks may be subdivided into any number of smaller land lots usually in private ownership, 
> though in some cases, it may be other forms of tenure. 
> 
> City blocks are usually built-up to varying degrees 
> and thus form the physical containers, or "streetwalls," of public spaces. 
> 
> Most cities are composed of a greater or lesser variety of sizes and shapes of an urban block. 
> For example, many pre-industrial cores of cities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East 
> tend to have irregularly shaped street patterns and urban blocks, 
> while cities based on grids have much more regular arrangements.
>
> By extension, the word "block" is an important informal unit of length 
> equal to the distance between two streets of a street grid.
