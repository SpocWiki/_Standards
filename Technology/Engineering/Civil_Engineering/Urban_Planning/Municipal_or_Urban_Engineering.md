## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Municipal or urban engineering applies the tools of science, art and engineering in an urban environment.
>
> Municipal engineering is concerned with municipal infrastructure.  This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, street lighting, municipal solid waste management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), public parks and cycling infrastructure.
>
> In the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services.  It can also include the optimizing of garbage collection and bus service networks.  Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority.
