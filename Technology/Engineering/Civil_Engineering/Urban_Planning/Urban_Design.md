> Urban design is an approach to the design of buildings and the spaces between them 
> that focuses on specific design processes and outcomes based on geographical location. 
> 
> In addition to designing and shaping the physical features of 
> towns, cities, and regional spaces, 
> urban design considers 'bigger picture' issues of 
> economic, social and environmental value and social design. 
> 
> The scope of a project can range from a local street or public space 
> to an entire city and surrounding areas. 
> 
> Urban designers connect the fields of architecture, landscape architecture 
> and urban planning to better organize local and community environments' 
> dependent upon geographical location.
>
> Some important focuses of urban design include its historical impact, 
> paradigm shifts, its interdisciplinary nature, and issues related to urban design.
