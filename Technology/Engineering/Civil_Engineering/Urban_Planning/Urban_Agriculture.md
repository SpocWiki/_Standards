## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Urban agriculture refers to various practices of 
> cultivating, processing, and distributing food in urban areas. 
> 
> The term also applies to the area activities of 
> animal husbandry, aquaculture, beekeeping, and horticulture in an urban context. 
> 
> Urban agriculture is distinguished from peri-urban agriculture, 
> which takes place in rural areas at the edge of suburbs. 
> 
> In many urban areas, efforts to expand agriculture 
> also require addressing legacy soil contamination, particularly from lead and other heavy metals, 
> which can pose risks to human health and food safety.
>
> Urban agriculture can appear at varying levels of economic and social development. 
> 
> It can involve a movement of organic growers, "foodies" and "locavores", 
> who seek to form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. 
> 
> These networks can develop by way of formal institutional support, 
> becoming integrated into local town planning 
> as a "transition town" movement for sustainable urban development. 
> 
> For others, food security, nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. 
> 
> In either case, the more direct access to fresh vegetable, fruit, and meat products 
> that may be realised through urban agriculture can improve food security and food safety 
> while decreasing food miles, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions, 
> thereby contributing to climate change mitigation.
