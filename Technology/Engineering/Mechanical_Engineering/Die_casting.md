## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by 
> forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. 
> 
> The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies 
> which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. 
> 
> Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, 
> specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and tin-based alloys. 
> Depending on the type of metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.
>
> The casting equipment and the metal dies represent large capital costs 
> and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. 
> 
> Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, 
> which keeps the incremental cost per item low. 
> 
> It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, 
> which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. 
> Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) 
> and dimensional consistency.
