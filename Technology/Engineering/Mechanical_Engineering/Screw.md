> A **Screw** is an externally helical threaded fastener 
> capable of being **tightened or released** by a twisting force (torque) to the head. 
> 
> The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together 
> and there are many forms for a variety of materials. 
> 
> Screws might be inserted into holes in assembled parts or a screw may form its own thread. 
> The difference between a screw and a bolt is that 
> the bolt is designed to be tightened or released by torquing a nut.
>
> The screw head on one end has a slot or other feature that commonly requires a tool to transfer the twisting force. Common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers, wrenches, coins and hex keys. The head is usually larger than the body, which  provides a bearing surface and keeps the screw from being driven deeper than its length; an exception being the set screw (aka grub screw).  The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is called the shank; it may be fully or partially threaded  with the distance between each thread called the pitch.
>
> Most screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is called a right-hand thread. Screws with a left-hand thread are used in exceptional cases, such as where the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque, which would tend to loosen a right-hand screw. For this reason, the left-side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.

> The screw mechanism is one of the six classical simple machines defined by Renaissance scientists.
