> A **simple machine** is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. 
> In general, they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage 
> (also called leverage) to multiply force. 
> Usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines that were defined by Renaissance scientists:
> - Lever 
> - Wheel and axle 
> - Pulley 
> - Inclined plane
> - Wedge
> - Screw
>
> A simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force. 
> Ignoring friction losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. 
> The machine can increase the amount of the output force, 
> at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load. 
> The ratio of the output to the applied force is called the mechanical advantage.
>
> Simple machines can be regarded as the elementary "building blocks" 
> of which all more complicated machines (sometimes called "compound machines") are composed. 
> For example, wheels, levers, and pulleys are all used in the mechanism of a bicycle. 
> The mechanical advantage of a compound machine is just 
> the product of the mechanical advantages of the simple machines of which it is composed.
>
> Although they continue to be of great importance in mechanics and applied science, 
> modern mechanics has moved beyond the view of the simple machines as the ultimate building blocks 
> of which all machines are composed, which arose in the Renaissance 
> as a neoclassical amplification of ancient Greek texts. 
> 
> The great variety and sophistication of modern machine linkages, 
> which arose during the Industrial Revolution, is inadequately described by these six simple categories. 
> Various post-Renaissance authors have compiled expanded lists of "simple machines", 
> often using terms like basic machines, compound machines, or machine elements 
> to distinguish them from the classical simple machines above. 
> 
> By the late 1800s, Franz Reuleaux had identified hundreds of machine elements, 
> calling them simple machines. 
> 
> Modern machine theory analyzes machines as kinematic chains 
> composed of elementary linkages called kinematic pairs.
