The idealised Stirling cycle consists of four [thermodynamic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_processes "Thermodynamic processes") acting on the working fluid:

![[../../../../../assets/Stirling_cycle.jpeg]] 
1. [Isothermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal "Isothermal") [expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion "Thermal expansion"). The expansion-space and associated heat exchanger are maintained at a constant high temperature, and the gas undergoes near-isothermal expansion absorbing heat from the hot source.
2. Constant-volume (known as [isovolumetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_process "Isometric process") or [isochoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochoric_process "Isochoric process")) heat-removal. The gas is passed through the [regenerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger "Regenerative heat exchanger"), where it cools, transferring heat to the regenerator for use in the next cycle.
3. [Isothermal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal "Isothermal") [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_ratio "Compression ratio"). The compression space and associated heat exchanger are maintained at a constant low temperature so the gas undergoes near-isothermal compression rejecting heat to the cold sink
4. Constant-volume (known as [isovolumetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_process "Isometric process") or [isochoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochoric_process "Isochoric process")) heat-addition. The gas passes back through the regenerator where it recovers much of the heat transferred in process 2, heating up on its way to the expansion space.

> A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic expansion and contraction of air 
> or other gas (the working fluid) by exposing it to different temperatures, 
> resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. 
>
> More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine, 
> with a permanent gaseous working fluid. 
> 
> Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system 
> in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system. 
> 
> Regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, 
> known as the regenerator. Strictly speaking, the inclusion of the regenerator is 
> what differentiates a Stirling engine from other closed-cycle hot air engines.
>
> In the Stirling engine, a working fluid (e.g. air) is heated 
> by energy supplied from outside the engine's interior space (cylinder).  
> 
> As the fluid expands, mechanical work is extracted by a piston, which is coupled to a displacer. 
> The displacer moves the working fluid to a different location within the engine, where it is cooled, 
> which creates a partial vacuum at the working cylinder, and more mechanical work is extracted. 
> The displacer moves the cooled fluid back to the hot part of the engine, and the cycle continues.
>
> A unique feature is the regenerator, which acts as a temporary heat store 
> by retaining heat within the machine rather than dumping it into the heat sink, 
> thereby increasing its efficiency.   
>
> The heat is supplied from the outside, so the hot area of the engine can be warmed with any external heat source. Similarly, the cooler part of the engine can be maintained by an external heat sink, such as running water or air flow. The gas is permanently retained in the engine, allowing a gas with the most-suitable properties to be used, such as helium or hydrogen. There are no intake and no exhaust gas flows so the machine is practically silent.
>
> The machine is reversible so that if the shaft is turned by an external power source a temperature difference will develop across the machine; in this way it acts as a heat pump.
>
> The Stirling engine was invented by Scotsman  Robert Stirling in 1816 as an industrial prime mover to rival the steam engine, and its practical use was largely confined to low-power domestic applications for over a century. 
>
> Contemporary investment in renewable energy, especially solar energy, has given rise to its application within concentrated solar power and as a heat pump.
