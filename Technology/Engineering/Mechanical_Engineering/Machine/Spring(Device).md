> A spring is a device consisting of an elastic but largely rigid material (typically metal) 
> bent or molded into a form (especially a coil) 
> that can return into shape after being compressed, extended or twisted. 
> 
> Springs can store energy when compressed, when extended, and/or when twisted. 
> 
> In everyday use, the term most often refers to coil springs, 
> but there are many different spring designs. 
> Modern springs are typically manufactured from spring steel. 
> An example of a non-metallic spring is the bow, made traditionally of flexible  yew wood, 
> which when drawn stores energy to propel an arrow.
>
> When a conventional spring, without stiffness variability features, 
> is compressed or stretched from its resting position, 
> it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length 
> (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). 
> 
> The rate or spring constant of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, 
> divided by the change in deflection of the spring. 
> That is, it is the gradient of the force versus deflection curve. 
> 
> An extension or compression spring's rate is expressed in units of force divided by distance, 
> for example or N/m or lbf/in. 
> 
> A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting; 
> when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a torque proportional to the angle. 
> A torsion spring's rate is in units of torque divided by angle, such as N·m/rad or ft·lbf/degree. 
> 
> The inverse of spring rate is compliance, that is: 
> if a spring has a rate of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1 mm/N. 
> The stiffness (or rate) of springs in parallel is additive, as is the compliance of springs in series.
>
> Springs are made from a variety of elastic materials, the most common being spring steel. 
> 
> Small springs can be wound from pre-hardened stock, 
> while larger ones are made from annealed steel and hardened after manufacture. 
> 
> Some non-ferrous metals are also used, including phosphor bronze and titanium 
> for parts requiring corrosion resistance, 
> and low-resistance beryllium copper for springs carrying electric current.
