## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Civil engineering** is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, 
> and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, 
> including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, 
> sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.
>
> Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. 
> It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, 
> and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. 
>
> Civil engineering can take place in the public sector 
> from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, 
> and in the private sector from locally based firms to Fortune Global 500 companies.
