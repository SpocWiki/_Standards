## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Mechatronics** engineering, also called mechatronics, 
> is the synergistic integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems 
> employing mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic engineering and computer engineering, 
> and includes a combination of robotics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, automation and product engineering.
>
> As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded 
> in both adapting and multiplying. 
> 
> The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution 
> that unifies each of these various subfields. 
> Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than 
> a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, 
> hence the name being a portmanteau of the words "mechanics" and "electronics"; 
> however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, 
> the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.
>
> Many people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword 
> synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering.
>
> French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: 
> "approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, 
> and computer science within product design and manufacturing, 
> in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality".
