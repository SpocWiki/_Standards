## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Nuclear engineering is the engineering discipline 
> concerned with designing and applying systems 
> that utilize the energy released by nuclear processes.
>
> The most prominent application of nuclear engineering is the generation of electricity. 
> Worldwide, some 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries 
> generate 10 percent of the world's energy through nuclear fission. 
> 
> In the future, it is expected 
> that nuclear fusion will add another nuclear means of generating energy. 
> 
> Both reactions make use of the nuclear binding energy released 
> when atomic nucleons are either separated (fission) or brought together (fusion). 
> 
> The energy available is given by the binding energy curve, 
> and the amount generated is much greater 
> than that generated through chemical reactions. 
> 
> Fission of 1 gram of uranium yields as much energy 
> as burning 3 tons of coal or 600 gallons of fuel oil, 
> without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
