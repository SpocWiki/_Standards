> **Information technology** (IT) is a set of related fields within information and communications technology 
> (ICT), that encompass computer systems, software, programming languages, data 
> and information processing, and storage. 
> Information technology is an application of computer science and computer engineering.
>
> The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, 
> but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. 
> Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, 
> including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, 
> and e-commerce.
>
> An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, 
> a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system —
>  including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, 
>  and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system. 
>  IT systems play a vital role in facilitating efficient data management, 
>  enhancing communication networks, and supporting organizational processes across various industries. 
>  Successful IT projects require meticulous planning and ongoing maintenance 
>  to ensure optimal functionality and alignment with organizational objectives.
>
> Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, analysing 
> and communicating information since the earliest writing systems were developed, 
> the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article 
> published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented 
> that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. 
> We shall call it information technology (IT)." 
> Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, 
> the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, 
> and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
