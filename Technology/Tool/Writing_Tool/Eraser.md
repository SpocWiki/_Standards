## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An **Eraser** (also known as a rubber in some Commonwealth countries, 
> including South Africa from which the material first used got its name) 
> is an article of stationery that is used for removing marks from paper or skin 
> (e.g. parchment or vellum). 
> 
> Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. 
> Some pencils have an eraser on one end. 
> Less expensive erasers are made from synthetic rubber and synthetic soy-based gum, 
> but more expensive or specialized erasers are made from vinyl, plastic, or gum-like materials.
>
> At first, erasers were invented to erase mistakes made with a pencil; 
> later, more abrasive ink erasers were introduced. 
> 
> The term is also used for things that remove marks from chalkboards and whiteboards.
