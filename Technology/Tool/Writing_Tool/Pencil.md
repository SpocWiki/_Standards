> A **Pencil** is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core 
> in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage 
> and keeps it from marking the user's hand.
>
> Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material 
> that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. 
> They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.
>
> Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. 
> Graphite pencils (traditionally known as "lead pencils") produce grey or black marks 
> that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, 
> ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. 
> 
> Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, 
> are mainly used for drawing and sketching. 
> 
> Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, 
> but are typically regarded as art supplies, 
> especially those with cores made from wax-based binders 
> that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. 
> 
> Grease pencils have a softer, oily core 
> that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.
>
> The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section, 
> but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core. 
> 
> Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. 
> To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off 
> to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. 
> 
> Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; 
> instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted 
> (usually through the casing's tip) as needed. 
> 
> These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) 
> as the previous ones are exhausted.
