> A **Pen** is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, 
> typically paper, for writing or drawing. 
> 
> Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens 
> held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity 
> that had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell. 
>
> Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, 
> such as in illustration and calligraphy. 
> Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, 
> have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens. 
>
> Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, 
> have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph. 
> 
> All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, 
> such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.
