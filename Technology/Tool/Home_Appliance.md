## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A home appliance, also referred to as a domestic appliance, 
> an electric appliance or a household appliance, 
> is a machine which assists in household functions 
> such as cooking, cleaning and food preservation.
>
> The domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of appliance as 
> "an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function". 
> 
> Collins English Dictionary defines "home appliance" as: "devices or machines, usually electrical, 
> that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking". 
> The broad usage allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, 
> including consumer electronics as well as stoves, refrigerators, toasters and air conditioners.
>
> The development of self-contained electric and gas-powered appliances, 
> an American innovation, emerged in the early 20th century. 
> This evolution is linked to the decline of full-time domestic servants 
> and desire to reduce household chores, allowing for more leisure time. 
> 
> Early appliances included washing machines, water heaters, refrigerators, and sewing machines. 
> 
> The industry saw significant growth post-World War II, 
> with the introduction of dishwashers and clothes dryers. 
> By the 1980s, the appliance industry was booming, leading to mergers and antitrust legislation. 
> The US National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 
> mandated a 25% reduction in energy consumption every five years. 
> By the 1990s, five companies dominated over 90% of the market.
>
> Major appliances, often called white goods, include items like refrigerators and washing machines, 
> while small appliances encompass items such as toasters and coffee makers. 
> 
> Product design shifted in the 1960s, embracing new materials and colors. 
> Consumer electronics, often referred to as brown goods, include items like TVs and computers. 
> There is a growing trend towards home automation and internet-connected appliances. 
> 
> Recycling of home appliances involves dismantling and recovering materials.
