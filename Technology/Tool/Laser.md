> A **Laser** is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification 
> based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. 
> The word laser originated as an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. 
> The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, 
> based on theoretical work by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow 
> and the optical amplifier patented by Gordon Gould.
>
> A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light that is coherent. 
> Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, 
> enabling uses such as optical communication, laser cutting, and lithography. 
> It also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), 
> used in laser pointers, lidar, and free-space optical communication. 
> Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, 
> which permits them to emit light with a very narrow frequency spectrum. 
> Temporal coherence can also be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light 
> with a broad spectrum but durations measured in attoseconds.
>
> Lasers are used in fiber-optic and free-space optical communications, 
> optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, 
> semiconductor chip manufacturing (photolithography, etching), 
> laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, 
> military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, 
> and in laser lighting displays for entertainment. 
> 
> The laser is regarded as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.
