> A **Sock** is a piece of clothing worn on the feet 
> and often covering the ankle or some part of the calf. 
> 
> Some types of shoes or boots are typically worn over socks. 
> In ancient times, socks were made from leather or matted animal hair. 
> 
> Machine-knit socks were first produced in the late 16th century. 
> 
> Until the 1800s, both hand-made and machine-knit socks were manufactured, 
> with the latter technique becoming more common in the 19th century, 
> and continuing until the modern day.
>
> One of the roles of socks is absorbing perspiration. 
> The foot is among the heaviest producers of sweat in the body: 
> it can produce over 0.25 US pints (0.12 L) of perspiration per day. 
> Socks help to absorb this sweat and draw it to areas 
> where air can evaporate the perspiration. 
> 
> They also protect shoes, a more expensive, durable, and frequently reworn foot covering, 
> from perspiration, extending their life.
>
> In cold environments, warm socks help people avoid getting cold feet, 
> which in turn helps decrease the risk of getting frostbite. 
> Thin socks are most commonly worn in the summer months to keep feet cool.
>
> In men's fashion, light-colored socks are typically worn with sports shoes 
> and dark-colored socks with dress shoes (often black or navy blue dress socks). 
> 
> Fanciful sock designs are becoming more common.
