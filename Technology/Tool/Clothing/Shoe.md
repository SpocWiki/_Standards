> A **Shoe** is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot. 
> Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, 
> it is vulnerable, and shoes provide protection. 
> 
> Form was originally tied to function, but over time, shoes also became fashion items. 
> Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots, 
> which are required footwear at industrial worksites.
>
> Additionally, shoes have often evolved into many different designs; 
> high heels, for instance, are most commonly worn by women during fancy occasions. 
> 
> Contemporary footwear varies vastly in style, complexity and cost. 
> Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. 
> 
> High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, 
> use complex construction and sell for large sums of money. 
> 
> Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, 
> such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing, 
> while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers 
> which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe.
>
> Traditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, 
> but are increasingly being made from rubber, plastics, 
> and other petrochemical-derived materials. 
> 
> Globally, the shoe industry is a $200 billion a year industry. 
> 90% of shoes end up in landfills, because the materials are hard to separate, 
> recycle or otherwise reuse.
