> A **Shirt** is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).
>
> Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, 
> a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. 
> 
> In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, 
> and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps 
> (North Americans would call that a "dress shirt", a specific type of collared shirt). 
> A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.
