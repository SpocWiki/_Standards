## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Underwear, underclothing, or **Undergarment**s are items of clothing 
> worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, 
> although they may comprise more than a single layer. 
> 
> They serve to keep outer clothing from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, 
> to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, 
> and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. 
> 
> In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. 
> Special types of undergarments have religious significance. 
> Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, 
> such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, 
> are appropriate both as underwear and outerwear. 
> 
> If made of suitable material or textile, 
> some underwear can serve as nightwear or swimwear, 
> and some undergarments are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal.
>
> Undergarments are generally of two types, 
> - those that are worn to cover the torso 
> - and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, 
> although there are also underclothes which cover both. 
> 
> Different styles of underwear are generally worn by males and females. 
> 
> Undergarments commonly worn by males today include boxer briefs or boxer shorts, 
> while females often wear bras and panties (knickers in British English). 
> 
> Items worn by both sexes include T-shirts, sleeveless shirts 
> (also called singlets, tank tops, A-shirts, or vests), classic briefs, bikini briefs, thongs, G-strings and T-fronts.
