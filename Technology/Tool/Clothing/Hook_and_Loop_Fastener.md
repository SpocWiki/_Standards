## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Hook-and-loop fasteners, commonly known as Velcro (a genericized trademark), 
> hook-and-pile fasteners or touch fasteners are versatile fastening devices 
> that allow two surfaces to be repeatedly attached and detached with ease. 
> 
> Invented in the mid-20th century, they are widely used in 
> clothing, accessories, and various industrial and consumer applications. 
> 
> The fastener consists of two complementary components: 
> one with tiny hooks and the other with soft loops. 
> 
> When pressed together, the hooks catch the loops, creating a secure but temporary bond. 
> The fasteners can be separated by peeling or pulling the surfaces apart, 
> often producing a distinctive ripping sound.
