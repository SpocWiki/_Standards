> A **mitten** is a type of glove that covers the hand 
> but does not have separate finger openings or sheaths. 
> 
> Generally, mittens still separate the thumb from the other four fingers. 
> They have different colours and designs. 
> 
> Mittens provide greater thermal insulation than gloves 
> as they have a smaller surface area exposed to the cold, 
> but have a trade-off in dexterity.
>
> Mittens are associated with cold weather, children's clothing, comfort and various occupational uses. 
> In the English-speaking world, they also have a cultural association with domestic cats, 
> as in the "Three Little Kittens".
>
> Mittens are a common sight on ski slopes, 
> as they not only provide extra warmth but extra protection from injury. 
> They are also recommended as part of extreme cold weather clothing. 
> Oven mitts are worn in the kitchen to protect the hands from hot objects.
