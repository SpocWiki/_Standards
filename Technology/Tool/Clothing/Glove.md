> A **Glove** is a garment covering the hand, 
> with separate sheaths or openings for each finger including the thumb. 
> 
> Gloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, 
> abrasion or chemicals, and disease; 
> or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch.
>
> Gloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or felted wool, leather, rubber, latex, neoprene, silk, and (in mail) metal. 
> Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. 
> Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits.
>
> Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves 
> are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. 
> 
> Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. 
> Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, 
> which makes the crime investigation more difficult. 
> However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints.
>
> If there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger 
> they are called fingerless gloves. 
> Fingerless gloves are useful where dexterity is required that gloves would restrict. 
> Cigarette smokers and church organists sometimes use fingerless gloves. 
> Cycling gloves for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. 
> Guitar players may also use fingerless gloves in circumstances 
> where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand.
>
> A hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers 
> (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) 
> and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. 
> This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back 
> to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. 
> The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, 
> allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by a hook-and-loop fastener or a button) 
> to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. 
> These hybrids are called convertible mittens or "glittens".
