> A **Cloak** is a type of loose garment worn over clothing, 
> mostly but not always as outerwear for outdoor wear, 
> which serves the same purpose as an overcoat and protects the wearer from the weather. 
> It may form part of a uniform. People in many different societies may wear cloaks. 
> Over time, cloak designs have changed to match fashion and available textiles.
>
> Cloaks generally fasten at the neck or over the shoulder, 
> and vary in length from the hip to the ankle, with mid-calf being the normal length. 
> They may have an attached hood and may cover and fasten down the front, 
> in which case they have holes or slits for the hands to pass through. 
> However, cloaks are almost always sleeveless.
>
> Christian clerics may wear a cappa or a cope – forms of cloak – 
> as liturgical vestments or as part of a religious habit.
