> A **Pearl** is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) 
> of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as fossil  conulariids. 
> 
> Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate 
> (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, 
> which has deposited in concentric layers. 
> 
> More commercially valuable pearls are perfectly round and smooth, 
> but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur. 
> 
> The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones 
> and objects of beauty for many centuries. 
> Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable, and valuable.
>
> The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild but are extremely rare. 
> These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. 
> Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels 
> make up the majority of those currently sold. 
> 
> Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry. 
> Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry 
> but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. 
> They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines, and paint formulations.
>
> Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, 
> like the interior of the shell that produces them. 
> However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls 
> (technically "calcareous concretions") of lesser shine or less spherical shape. 
> 
> Although these may also be legitimately referred to as "pearls" by gemological labs 
> and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, 
> most of them have no value except as curiosities.
