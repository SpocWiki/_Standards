> **Cosmetics** are substances that are intended for application to the body 
> for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering appearance. 
> 
> They are mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources or created synthetically. 
> Cosmetics have various purposes, including personal and skin care. They can also be used to conceal blemishes and enhance natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes). Makeup can also add colour to a person's face, enhance a person's features or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object.
>
> People have used cosmetics for thousands of years for skin care and appearance enhancement. Visible cosmetics for both women and men have gone in and out of fashion over the centuries. 
>
> Some early forms of cosmetics contained harmful ingredients such as lead that caused serious health problems and sometimes resulted in death. Modern commercial cosmetics are generally tested for safety but may contain controversial ingredients, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), formaldehyde releasers, and ingredients that cause allergic reactions.
>
> The European Union and regulatory agencies around the world have stringent regulations for cosmetics. In the United States, cosmetic products and ingredients do not require FDA approval, although marketed products are monitored for safety. Some countries have banned using animal testing for cosmetics.
