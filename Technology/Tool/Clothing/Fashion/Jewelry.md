> Jewellery (or **Jewelry** in American English) consists of decorative items worn for personal adornment 
> such as brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and cufflinks. 
> 
> Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. 
> From a Western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example. 
> For many centuries, metals such as gold and silver, often combined with gemstones, 
> has been the normal material for jewellery. 
> Other materials such as glass, shells, or wood may also be used.
>
> Jewellery is one of the oldest types of archaeological artefact – with 100,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery. The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.
>
> Jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral, precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been important.  In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital jewellery. In modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.  Jewellery that is designed to be worn for long periods, is difficult to remove, or is always worn is called permanent jewellery.
