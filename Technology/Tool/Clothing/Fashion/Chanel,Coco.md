> Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel (19 August 1883 – 10 January 1971) 
> was a French fashion designer and businesswoman. 
> 
> The founder and namesake of the Chanel brand, she was credited in the post–World War I era 
> with popularizing a __sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style__. 
> This replaced the "corseted silhouette" that had earlier been dominant 
> with a style that was simpler, far less time-consuming to put on and remove, 
> more comfortable, and less expensive, all without sacrificing elegance. 
> 
> She is the only fashion designer listed on Time magazine's list of 
> the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. 
> 
> A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing, 
> realizing her aesthetic design in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. 
> Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product, 
> and Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, 
> which has been in use since the 1920s.
>
> Her couture house closed in 1939, with the outbreak of World War II. 
> Chanel stayed in France and was criticized during the war 
> for collaborating with the Nazi-German occupiers and the Vichy puppet regime 
> to free her nephew from a prisoner of war camp. 
> 
> To secure his release Chanel began a liaison with a German diplomat she had known before the war, 
> Baron (Freiherr) Hans Günther von Dincklage. 
> And following her nephew's release, she collaborated in minor ways. 
> After the war, Chanel was interrogated about her relationship with Dincklage, 
> but she was not charged as a collaborator due to intervention by her friend—
> British prime minister Winston Churchill. 
> 
> When the war ended, Chanel moved to Switzerland, 
> returning to Paris in 1954 to revive her fashion house. 
> In 2011, Hal Vaughan published a biography about Chanel based on newly declassified documents, 
> revealing that she had collaborated directly with the Nazi intelligence service, the Sicherheitsdienst. 
> One plan in late 1943 was for her to carry an SS peace overture to Churchill to end the war.
