> A micrometer (my-KROM-it-É™r), sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge (MSG), 
> is a device incorporating a calibrated screw 
> for accurate measurement of the size of components. 
> 
> It is widely used in mechanical engineering, machining, metrology and most mechanical trades, 
> along with other dimensional instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers. 
> 
> Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.
