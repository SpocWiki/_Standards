> A **Spectrometer** is a scientific instrument 
> used to separate and measure spectral components of a physical phenomenon. 
> 
> Spectrometer is a broad term often used to describe instruments that 
> measure a continuous variable of a phenomenon 
> where the spectral components are somehow mixed. 
> 
> In visible light a spectrometer can separate white light 
> and measure individual narrow bands of color, called a spectrum. 
> 
> A mass spectrometer 
> measures the spectrum of the masses of the atoms or molecules present in a gas. 
> 
> The first spectrometers were used to split light into an array of separate colors. 
> Spectrometers were developed in early studies of physics, astronomy, and chemistry. 
> 
> The capability of spectroscopy to determine chemical composition 
> drove its advancement and continues to be one of its primary uses. 
> 
> Spectrometers are used in astronomy to analyze the chemical composition of stars and planets, 
> and spectrometers gather data on the origin of the universe. 
>
> Examples of spectrometers are devices that 
> separate particles, atoms, and molecules by their mass, momentum, or energy. 
> 
> These types of spectrometers are used in chemical analysis and particle physics.
