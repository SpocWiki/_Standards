> A **Periscope** is an instrument for observation over, around or through an object, obstacle or condition 
> that prevents direct line-of-sight observation from an observer's current position.
>
> In its simplest form, it consists of an outer case with mirrors at each end 
> set parallel to each other at a 45Â° angle. 
> 
> This form of periscope, with the addition of two simple lenses, 
> served for observation purposes in the trenches during World War I. 
> Military personnel also use periscopes in some gun turrets and in armoured vehicles.
>
> More complex periscopes using prisms or advanced fiber optics instead of mirrors 
> and providing magnification operate on submarines and in various fields of science. 
> 
> The overall design of the classical submarine periscope is very simple: 
> two telescopes pointed into each other. 
> 
> If the two telescopes have different individual magnification, 
> the difference between them causes an overall magnification or reduction.
