> An **Endoscope** is an inspection instrument composed of image sensor, 
> optical lens, light source and mechanical device, 
> which is used to look deep into the body by way of openings such as the mouth or anus. 
> 
> A typical endoscope applies several modern technologies 
> including optics, ergonomics, precision mechanics, electronics, and software engineering. 
> 
> With an endoscope, it is possible to observe lesions that cannot be detected by X-ray, 
> making it useful in medical diagnosis. 
> 
> An endoscope uses tubes only a few millimeters thick 
> to transfer illumination in one direction and high-resolution video in the other, 
> allowing minimally invasive surgeries. 
> 
> It is used to examine the internal organs like the throat or esophagus. 
> 
> Specialized instruments are named after their target organ. 
> Examples include the cystoscope (bladder), nephroscope (kidney), bronchoscope (bronchus), arthroscope (joints) and colonoscope (colon), and laparoscope (abdomen or pelvis). 
> 
> They can be used to examine visually and diagnose, or assist in surgery such as an arthroscopy.
