> A **Theodolite** is a precision optical instrument for measuring angles 
> between designated visible points in the horizontal and vertical planes. 
> 
> The traditional use has been for land surveying, 
> but it is also used extensively for building and infrastructure construction, 
> and some specialized applications such as meteorology and rocket launching.
>
> It consists of a moveable telescope mounted so it can rotate around horizontal and vertical axes 
> and provide angular readouts. 
> 
> These indicate the orientation of the telescope, 
> and are used to relate the first point sighted through the telescope 
> to subsequent sightings of other points from the same theodolite position. 
> 
> Depending on the instrument, 
> these angles can be measured with accuracies down to microradians or seconds of arc. 
> 
> From these readings a plan can be drawn, 
> or objects can be positioned in accordance with an existing plan. 
> 
> The modern theodolite has evolved into what is known as a total station 
> where angles and distances are measured electronically, and are read directly to computer memory.
>
> A transit theodolite has a telescope short enough 
> to rotate about the instrument's horizontal trunnion axis, 
> turning the scope through the vertical plane and its zenith; 
> vertical rotation in non-transit instruments is restricted to a limited arc.
>
> The optical level is sometimes mistaken for a theodolite, 
> but it does not measure vertical angles, and is used only for leveling on a horizontal plane 
> (though often combined with medium accuracy horizontal range and direction measurements).
