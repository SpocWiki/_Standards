## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A refracting telescope (also called a refractor) is a type of optical telescope 
> that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a dioptric telescope). 
> 
> The refracting telescope design was originally used in spyglasses 
> and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long-focus camera lenses. 
> 
> Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most research purposes, the refracting telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope, which allows larger apertures. 
> A refractor's magnification is calculated by 
> dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece.
>
> Refracting telescopes typically have a lens at the front, then a long tube, 
> then an eyepiece or instrumentation at the rear, 
> where the telescope view comes to focus. 
> 
> Originally, telescopes had an objective of one element, 
> but a century later, two and even three element lenses were made.
>
> Refracting telescopes use technology 
> that has often been applied to other optical devices, 
> such as binoculars and zoom lenses/telephoto lens/long-focus lens.
