> The Spitzer Space Telescope, formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), 
> was an infrared space telescope launched in 2003, 
> that was deactivated when operations ended on 30 January 2020. 
> 
> Spitzer was the third space telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy, 
> following IRAS (1983) and ISO (1995–1998). 
> It was the first spacecraft to use an Earth-trailing orbit, later used by the Kepler planet-finder.
>
> The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years 
> with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years 
> until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. 
> 
> This occurred on 15 May 2009. 
> Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, 
> most of the instruments were no longer usable. 
> 
> However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera 
> continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the helium was exhausted, 
> and continued to be used into early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission.
>
> During the warm mission, the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 28.7 K 
> and were predicted to experience little to no degradation at this temperature compared to the nominal mission. 
> 
> The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).
>
> In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed 
> after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. 
> 
> Unlike most telescopes that are named by a board of scientists, 
> typically after famous deceased astronomers, 
> the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.
>
> The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer, 
> who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s. 
> 
> Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation 
> describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory 
> and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology. 
> 
> He has been cited for his pioneering contributions to rocketry and astronomy, 
> as well as "his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages 
> and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program."
>
> The US$776 million Spitzer was launched on 25 August 2003 at 05:35:39 UTC 
> from Cape Canaveral SLC-17B aboard a Delta II 7920H rocket. 
> 
> It was placed into a heliocentric (as opposed to a geocentric) orbit 
> trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical units per year 
> (an "Earth-trailing" orbit).
>
> The primary mirror is 85 centimeters (33 in) in diameter, f/12, 
> made of beryllium and was cooled to 5.5 K (−268 °C; −450 °F). 
> 
> The satellite contains three instruments that allowed it to perform 
> - astronomical imaging and photometry from 3.6 to 160 micrometers, 
> - spectroscopy from 5.2 to 38 micrometers, and 
> - spectrophotometry from 55 to 95 micrometers.
