> The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), 
> originally known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP and Explorer 80), 
> was a NASA spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 
> which measured temperature differences across the sky 
> in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) – 
> the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang. 
> 
> Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, 
> the mission was developed in a joint partnership 
> between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. 
> 
> The WMAP spacecraft was launched on 30 June 2001 from Florida. 
> The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission 
> and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorer program. 
> 
> In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), who had been a member of the mission's science team. 
> After nine years of operations, WMAP was switched off in 2010, 
> following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by European Space Agency (ESA) in 2009.
>
> WMAP's measurements played a key role in 
> establishing the current Standard Model of Cosmology: the Lambda-CDM model. 
> 
> The WMAP data are very well fit by a universe that is 
> dominated by dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. 
> 
> Other cosmological data are consistent, and together tightly constrain the Model.  
> 
> In the Lambda-CDM model of the universe, the age of the universe is 13.772±0.059 billion years. 
> 
> The WMAP mission's determination of the age of the universe is to better than 1% precision. 
> 
> The current expansion rate of the universe is (see Hubble constant) 69.32±0.80 km·s−1·Mpc−1. 
> 
> The content of the universe currently consists of 
> - 4.628%±0.093% ordinary baryonic matter; 
> - 24.02%+0.88%−0.87% cold dark matter (CDM) that neither emits nor absorbs light; and 
> - 71.35%+0.95%−0.96% of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant 
>   that accelerates the expansion of the universe. 
> 
> Less than 1% of the current content of the universe is in neutrinos, 
> but WMAP's measurements have found, for the first time in 2008, 
> that the data prefer the existence of a cosmic neutrino background with an effective number of neutrino species of 3.26±0.35. 
> 
> The contents point to a Euclidean flat geometry, 
> with curvature (Ω_k) of −0.0027+0.0039−0.0038. 
> 
> The WMAP measurements also support the cosmic inflation paradigm 
> in several ways, including the flatness measurement.
>
> The mission has won various awards: according to Science magazine, 
> the WMAP was the Breakthrough of the Year for 2003. This mission's results papers were first and second in the "Super Hot Papers in Science Since 2003" list. 
> 
> Of the all-time most referenced papers in physics and astronomy in the INSPIRE-HEP database, only three have been published since 2000, and all three are WMAP publications. 
> 
> Bennett, Lyman A. Page Jr., and David N. Spergel, the latter both of Princeton University, shared the 2010 Shaw Prize in astronomy for their work on WMAP. 
> Bennett and the WMAP science team were awarded the 2012 Gruber Prize in cosmology. 
> 
> The 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics was awarded to Bennett, Gary Hinshaw, Norman Jarosik, Page, Spergel, and the WMAP science team.
>
> In October 2010, the WMAP spacecraft was derelict in a heliocentric graveyard orbit 
> after completing nine years of operations. 
> 
> All WMAP data are released to the public and have been subject to careful scrutiny. 
> The final official data release was the nine-year release in 2012.
>
> Some aspects of the data are statistically unusual for the Standard Model of Cosmology. 
> 
> For example, the largest angular-scale measurement, the quadrupole moment, 
> is somewhat smaller than the Model would predict, 
> but this discrepancy is not highly significant. 
> 
> A large cold spot and other features of the data are more statistically significant, 
> and research continues into these.
