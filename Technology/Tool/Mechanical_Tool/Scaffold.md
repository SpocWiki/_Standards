> **Scaffold**ing, also called scaffold or staging, is a temporary structure 
> used to support a work crew and materials to aid in the construction, maintenance and repair 
> of buildings, bridges and all other human-made structures. 
> 
> Scaffolds are widely used on site to get access to heights 
> and areas that would be otherwise hard to get to. 
> 
> Unsafe scaffolding has the potential to result in death or serious injury. 
> 
> Scaffolding is also used in adapted forms for formwork and shoring, grandstand seating, 
> concert stages, access/viewing towers, exhibition stands, ski ramps, half pipes and art projects.
>
> There are six main types of scaffolding used worldwide today.  
> 
> These are tube and coupler (fitting) components, 
> prefabricated modular system scaffold components, 
> H-frame / façade modular system scaffolds, suspended scaffolds, timber scaffolds 
> and bamboo scaffolds (particularly in China, India and Hong Kong). 
> 
> Each type is made from several components which often include:
> - A base jack or plate which is a load-bearing base for the scaffold.
> - The standard, the upright component with connector joins.
> - The ledger, a horizontal brace.
> - The transom, a horizontal cross-section load-bearing component which holds the batten, board, or decking unit.
> - Brace diagonal and/or cross section bracing component.
> - Batten or board decking component used to make the working platform.
> - Coupler, a fitting used to join components together.
> - Scaffold tie, used to tie in the scaffold to structures.
> - Brackets, used to extend the width of working platforms.
>
> Specialized components used to aid in their use as a temporary structure 
> often include heavy duty load bearing transoms, 
> ladders or stairway units for the ingress and egress of the scaffold, 
> beams ladder/unit types used to span obstacles 
> and rubbish chutes used to remove unwanted materials from the scaffold or construction project.
