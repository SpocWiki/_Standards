> A **Knot** is an intentional complication in cordage which may be practical or decorative, or both. 
> 
> Practical knots are classified by function, including hitches, bends, loop knots, and splices: 
> - a hitch fastens a rope to another object; 
> - a bend fastens two ends of a rope to each another; 
> - a loop knot is any knot creating a loop; 
> - and splice denotes any multi-strand knot, including bends and loops. 
> 
> A knot may also refer, in the strictest sense, to a stopper or knob at the end of a rope 
> to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. 
> 
> Knots have excited interest since ancient times for their practical uses, 
> as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.
