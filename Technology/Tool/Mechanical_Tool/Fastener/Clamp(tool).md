## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A clamp is a fastening device used to hold or secure objects tightly together 
> to prevent movement or separation through the application of inward pressure. 
> In the United Kingdom the term cramp is often used instead when the tool is for temporary use 
> for positioning components during construction and woodworking; 
> thus a G cramp or a sash clamp but a wheel clamp or a surgical clamp.
>
> There are many types of clamps available for many different purposes. 
> Some are temporary, as used to position components while fixing them together, 
> others are intended to be permanent. 
> 
> In the field of animal husbandry, 
> using a clamp to attach an animal to a stationary object is known as "rounded clamping." 
> A physical clamp of this type is also used to refer to an obscure investment banking term, "fund clamps." Anything that performs the action of clamping may be called a clamp, so this gives rise to a wide variety of terms across many fields.
