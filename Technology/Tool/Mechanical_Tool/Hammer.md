> A  **Hammer** is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted "head" 
> fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object.
> 
> This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. 
> 
> Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking 
> and non-destructive striking applications. 
> Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, 
> and percussive musicianship (as with a gong).
>
> Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, 
> as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. 
> 
> Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance 
> against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, 
> in a lengthy downward planar arcâ€”downward to add kinetic energy to the impactâ€”
> pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, 
> with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; 
> 
> for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee 
> can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc 
> (but this is tiring). 
> 
> War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, 
> with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, 
> which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. 
> 
> Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion 
> permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. 
> 
> Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition 
> must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, 
> which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip.
>
> The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, 
> and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic.
>
> Ubiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a "claw" to pull nails out of wood, 
> and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America. 
> 
> Other types of hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes. 
> Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers. 
> 
> Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, 
> such as steam hammers and trip hammers, 
> are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm. 
> There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.
>
> For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration. 
> Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, 
> and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, 
> turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile. 
> 
> Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, 
> making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions. 
> 
> Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer 
> to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation. 
> A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use. 
> 
> Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, 
> but lack strength and durability compared to steel, 
> and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft.
>
> The high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, 
> especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil.
>
> In terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements 
> under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, 
> as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight. 
> 
> For this reason, accurate striking at speed 
> requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area. 
> 
> It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing 
> and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, 
> and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids.
