## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Sandpaper**, also known as coated abrasive or emery paper, 
> is a type of material that consists of sheets of paper or cloth 
> with an abrasive substance glued to one face. 
> 
> In the modern manufacture of these products, sand and glass have been replaced 
> by other abrasives such as aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. 
> 
> It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, 
> e.g. "aluminium oxide paper", or "silicon carbide paper".
>
> There are many varieties of sandpaper, with variations in the paper or backing, 
> the material used for the grit, grit size, and the bond.
>
> Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes 
> and is used to remove material from surfaces, whether to make them smoother 
> (for example, in painting and wood finishing), 
> to remove a layer of material (such as old paint), 
> or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for gluing). 
> 
> The grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number 
> that is inversely related to the particle size. 
> 
> A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit, 
> while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.
