> A **Toothbrush** is a special type of brush used to clean the teeth, gums, and tongue. 
> It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristles, onto which toothpaste is applied, 
> mounted on a handle that facilitates cleaning hard-to-reach areas of the mouth. 
> 
> They should be used in conjunction with tools that clean between the teeth―
> where toothbrush bristles cannot reach―such as floss, tape, interdental brushes or toothpicks.
>
> Toothbrushes are available in different bristle textures, sizes, and forms. 
> Most dentists recommend using soft-bristled toothbrushes, 
> as harder ones may damage tooth enamel or irritate the gums.
>
> Since many common toothpaste ingredients are harmful if swallowed in large amounts, 
> toothpaste should be spat out. 
> 
> Brushing teeth is most often done at a sink in a bathroom or kitchen, 
> where the toothbrush is rinsed afterwards to remove any debris remaining 
> and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for bacterial growth 
> (and, if it is a wooden toothbrush, mold as well).
>
> Some toothbrushes have plant-based handles, often made of bamboo. 
> However, most are made of cheap plastic; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution. 
> Over 1 billion toothbrushes are discarded into landfills annually in the United States alone. 
> Bristles are commonly made of nylon 
> (which, while not biodegradable like plastic, may still be recycled), bamboo viscose, or boar bristles.
