> A **Lathe** is a machine tool that rotates a workpiece about an axis of rotation 
> to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, deformation, facing, threading and turning, 
> with tools that are applied to the workpiece to create an object with symmetry about that axis. 
>
> Lathes are used in woodturning,  metalworking, metal spinning, thermal spraying, reclamation, and glass-working. Lathes can be used to shape pottery, the best-known such design being the potter's wheel. Most suitably equipped metalworking lathes can be used to produce most solids of revolution, plane surfaces, and screw threads or helices. Ornamental lathes can produce more complex three-dimensional solids. The workpiece is usually held in place by either one or two centers, at least one of which can typically be moved horizontally to accommodate varying workpiece lengths. Other work-holding methods include clamping the work about the axis of rotation using a chuck or collet, or attaching it to a faceplate using clamps or dog clutch. Lathes equipped with special lathe milling fixtures can be used to complete milling operations.
>
> Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include screws, candlesticks, gun barrels, cue sticks, table legs, bowls, baseball bats, pens, musical instruments (especially woodwind instruments), and crankshafts.
