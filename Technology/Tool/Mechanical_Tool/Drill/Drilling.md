> **Drilling** is a cutting process where a drill bit is spun to cut a hole of circular cross-section in solid materials. 
> The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool, often multi-point. 
> The bit is pressed against the work-piece and rotated 
> at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute. 
> This forces the cutting edge against the work-piece, 
> cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it is drilled.
>
> In rock drilling, the hole is usually not made through a circular cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, the hole is usually made by hammering a drill bit into the hole with quickly repeated short movements. The hammering action can be performed from outside the hole (top-hammer drill) or within the hole (down-the-hole drill, DTH). Drills used for horizontal drilling are called drifter drills.
>
> In rare cases, specially-shaped bits are used to cut holes of non-circular cross-section; a square cross-section is possible.
