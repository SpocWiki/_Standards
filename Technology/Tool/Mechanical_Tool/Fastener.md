> A **Fastener** (US English) or fastening (UK English) is a hardware device 
> that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects together. 
> 
> In general, fasteners are used to create non-permanent joints; 
> that is, joints that can be removed or dismantled without damaging the joining components. 
> Steel fasteners are usually made of stainless steel, carbon steel, or alloy steel.
>
> Other methods of joining materials, some of which may create permanent joints, include: 
> crimping, welding, soldering, brazing, taping, gluing, cement, or the use of other adhesives. 
> 
> Force may also be used, such as with magnets, vacuum (like suction cups), or even friction (like sticky pads). 
> Some types of woodworking joints make use of separate internal reinforcements, such as dowels or biscuits, 
> which in a sense can be considered fasteners within the scope of the joint system, 
> although on their own they are not general-purpose fasteners.
>
> Furniture supplied in flat-pack form often uses cam dowels locked by cam locks, 
> also known as conformat fasteners. 
> 
> Fasteners can also be used to close a container such as a bag, a box, or an envelope; 
> or they may involve keeping together the sides of an opening of flexible material, 
> attaching a lid to a container, etc. 
> There are also special-purpose closing devices, e.g., a bread clip.
>
> Items like a rope, string, wire, cable, chain, or plastic wrap may be used to mechanically join objects; 
> however, because they have additional common uses, they are not generally categorized as fasteners. 
> 
> Likewise, hinges and springs may join objects together, but they are ordinarily not considered fasteners 
> because their primary purpose is to allow articulation rather than rigid affixment.
