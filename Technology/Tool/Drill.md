> A **Drill** is a tool used for making round holes or driving fasteners. 
> It is fitted with a drill bit for making holes, or a screwdriver bit for securing fasteners. 
> 
> Historically, they were powered by hand, and later mains power, 
> but cordless battery-powered drills are proliferating due to increased efficiency and ease of use.
>
> Drills are commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, construction, machine tool fabrication, and utility projects. 
> Specially designed versions are made for surgery, dentistry, miniatures, and other applications.
