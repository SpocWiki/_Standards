> An **Endoscope** is an inspection instrument composed of image sensor, 
> optical lens, light source and mechanical device, 
> which is used to look deep into the body by way of openings such as the mouth or anus.

> A typical endoscope applies several modern technologies 
> including optics, ergonomics, precision mechanics, electronics, and software engineering. 
> 
> With an endoscope, it is possible to observe lesions that cannot be detected by X-ray, 
> making it useful in medical diagnosis. 
> 
> An endoscope uses tubes only a few millimeters thick 
> to transfer illumination in one direction and high-resolution video in the other, 
> allowing minimally invasive surgeries. 
> 
> It is used to examine the internal organs like the throat or esophagus. 
> 
> Specialized instruments are named after their target organ. 
> Examples include the cystoscope (bladder), nephroscope (kidney), bronchoscope (bronchus), arthroscope (joints) and colonoscope (colon), and laparoscope (abdomen or pelvis). They can be used to examine visually and diagnose, or assist in surgery such as an arthroscopy.
