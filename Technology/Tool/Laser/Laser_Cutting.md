> Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. 
> 
> While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, 
> it is now used by schools, small businesses, architecture, and hobbyists. 
> 
> Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. 
> The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material. 
> 
> A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system 
> to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. 
> 
> The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, 
> or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish.
