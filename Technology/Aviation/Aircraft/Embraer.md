> **Embraer** S.A. (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [ẽbɾaˈɛʁ]) is a Brazilian multinational aerospace corporation. 
> It develops and manufactures aircraft and aviation systems, 
> and provides leasing, equipment, and technical support services. 
> 
> Embraer is the third largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide after Boeing and Airbus. The company also has a significant presence in military aviation, ranking among the top 100 defense contractors. It is headquartered in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, with offices and operations in China, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, and the United States.
>
> Embraer was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government as a national champion for domestic aerospace technology. It initially focused on supplying military aircraft to the Brazilian Air Force, but by the 1980s began producing a series of successful commuter and regional airliners for export. The company was privatized in 1994 and began expanding to the production of larger regional airliners and smaller business jets. In 2000, Embraer became public as a limited company (Sociedade Anônima) with its own shares publicly traded in both the United States (NYSE) and Brazil (B3).
>
> Embraer has divisions for commercial, executive, military, and agricultural aviation; it also maintains an incubator for aerospace technologies and businesses. While the company continues producing aircraft for the defense sector, it is best known for the ERJ and E-Jet families of narrow-body short to medium range airliners, and for its line of business jets, including the market-leading Phenom 300. As of May 2024, Embraer has delivered more than 8,000 aircraft, including 1,800 E-Jet planes.
