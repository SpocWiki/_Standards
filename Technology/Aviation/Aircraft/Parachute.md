> A **Parachute** is a device designed to slow an object's descent through an atmosphere 
> by creating drag or aerodynamic lift. 
> 
> It is primarily used to safely support people exiting aircraft at height, 
> but also serves various purposes like slowing cargo, aiding in space capsule recovery on Earth, 
> landing spacecraft on other planets, and stabilizing vehicles or objects. 
> 
> Modern parachutes are typically made from durable fabrics like nylon 
> and come in various shapes, such as dome-shaped, rectangular, and inverted domes, 
> depending on their specific function.
>
> The concept of the parachute dates back to ancient attempts at flight. 
> In AD 852, Armen Firman, in Córdoba, Spain, 
> made the first recorded jump with a large cloak to slow his fall. 
> 
> Renaissance figures like Francesco di Giorgio Martini and Leonardo da Vinci 
> later sketched designs resembling modern parachutes, 
> but it was not until the 18th century that the first successful jumps occurred. 
> 
> French Louis-Sébastien Lenormand made the first public jump in 1783, 
> and he coined the term "parachute" in 1785. 
> 
> In the following years, key advancements were made by figures like André Garnerin, 
> with parachutes becoming lighter, more reliable, and easier to deploy.
>
> By the time of World War I, parachutes had become essential for aviators, 
> and significant improvements were made to their designs, 
> including the introduction of the backpack-style parachute by Charles Broadwick 
> and Gleb Kotelnikov's knapsack parachute. 
> 
> After World War II, parachuting became a popular sport, 
> and new materials like nylon replaced silk. 
> 
> Today, parachutes are used in military, recreational, and emergency situations, 
> continuing to evolve with advances in technology and design.
