> The Boeing Starliner (or CST-100) is a spacecraft designed 
> to transport crew to and from the International Space Station (ISS) and other low-Earth-orbit destinations. 
> Developed by Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP), 
> it consists of a reusable crew capsule and an expendable service module.
>
> Slightly larger than the Apollo command module or [[../../../../../_Standards/Technology/Spaceflight/SpaceX|SpaceX]] Crew Dragon, 
> but smaller than the Orion capsule, 
> the Starliner can accommodate a crew of up to seven, 
> though NASA plans to fly no more than four. 
> 
> It can remain docked to the ISS for up to seven months 
> and is launched on an Atlas V N22 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida.
>
> In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing a US$4.2 billion fixed-price contract to build Starliner, 
> while SpaceX received $2.6 billion to develop Crew Dragon. 
> By July 2024, Boeing's effort had exceeded its budget by at least $1.6 billion.
>
> Originally planned to be operational in 2017, 
> Starliner has been repeatedly delayed by problems in management and engineering. 
> 
> The first unmanned Orbital Flight Test in December 2019 was deemed a partial failure, 
> leading to a second Orbital Flight Test in May 2022. 
> 
> The Crew Flight Test, launched in June 2024, experienced malfunctions–leaking helium 
> and outage of five of the eight aft-facing reaction control system thrusters–on approach to the ISS, 
> leading NASA to conclude that it was too risky to return its astronauts to Earth aboard Starliner. 
> Starliner CFT-1 landed uncrewed at the White Sands Space Harbor in September 2024.
>
> Starliner costs more per flight than Crew Dragon, drawing criticism from NASA's inspector general and other observers.
