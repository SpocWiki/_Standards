> A **Balloon** is a flexible membrane bag that can be inflated with a gas, 
> such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, or air. 
> 
> For special purposes, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, 
> granular media (e.g. sand, flour or rice), or light sources. 
> 
> Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex, polychloroprene, 
> or a nylon fabric, and can come in many different colors. 
> 
> Some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder. 
> Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation. A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications.
>
> The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various gases. He invented them for use in the lab.
