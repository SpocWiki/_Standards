> The Saturn V is a retired American super heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by NASA 
> under the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon. 
> 
> The rocket was human-rated, had three stages, and was powered by liquid fuel. 
> Flown from 1967 to 1973, it was used for nine crewed flights to the Moon 
> and to launch Skylab, the first American space station.
>
> As of 2025, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle 
> to have carried humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). 
> 
> The Saturn V holds the record for the largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit, 140,000 kg, 
> which included unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command and service module 
> and Lunar Module to the Moon.
>
> The largest production model of the Saturn family of rockets, 
> the Saturn V was designed under the direction of Wernher von Braun 
> at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; 
> the lead contractors for construction of the rocket were
