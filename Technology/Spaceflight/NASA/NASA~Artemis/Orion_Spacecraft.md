## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Orion (Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle or Orion MPCV) 
> is a partially reusable crewed spacecraft used in [[../NASA~Artemis|NASA~Artemis]] program. 
> 
> The spacecraft consists of a 
> - Crew Module (CM) space capsule designed by Lockheed Martin 
> - and the European Service Module (ESM) manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space. 
> 
> Capable of supporting a crew of four beyond low Earth orbit, 
> Orion can last up to 21 days undocked and up to six months docked. 
> It is equipped with solar panels, an automated docking system, 
> and glass cockpit interfaces modeled after those used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 
> A single AJ10 engine provides the spacecraft's primary propulsion, 
> while eight R-4D-11 engines, and six pods of custom reaction control system engines 
> developed by Airbus, provide the spacecraft's secondary propulsion. 
> Orion is intended to be launched atop a Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, 
> with a tower launch escape system.
>
> Orion was conceived in the early 2000s by Lockheed Martin 
> as a proposal for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) 
> to be used in NASA's Constellation program and was selected by NASA in 2006. 
> 
> Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, 
> Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; 
> later named Moon to Mars. 
> 
> The SLS became Orion's primary launch vehicle, 
> and the service module was replaced with a design 
> based on the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle. 
> 
> A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 
> during Exploration Flight Test-1, while at least four test articles were produced. 
> Orion was primarily designed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Littleton, Colorado, 
> with former Space Shuttle engineer Julie Kramer White at NASA 
> as Orion's chief engineer.
>
> As of 2022, three flight-worthy **Orion spacecraft** are under construction, 
> with one completed and an additional one ordered, for use in NASA's Artemis program.
>
> The first completed unit, CM-002, was launched on November 16, 2022, on Artemis 1.
