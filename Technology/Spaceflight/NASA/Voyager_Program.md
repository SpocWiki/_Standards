> The Voyager program is an American scientific program 
> that employs two **interstellar** probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. 
> 
> They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment 
> to explore the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn 
> and potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune—
> to fly near them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth. 
> 
> After Voyager 1 successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan, 
> it was decided to send Voyager 2 on flybys of Uranus and Neptune. 
>
> After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made 
> to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space 
> and the outer regions of the Solar System. 
> 
> On 25 August 2012, data from Voyager 1 indicated that it had entered interstellar space. 
> On 5 November 2019, data from Voyager 2 indicated that it also had entered interstellar space. 
> 
> On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, 
> the Voyager 2 probe had officially reached the interstellar medium (ISM), 
> a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind, as did Voyager 1 in 2012. 
> 
> In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by the New Horizons spacecraft, 
> the existence of a "hydrogen wall" at the outer edges of the Solar System 
> that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft.
>
> As of 2024, the Voyagers are **still in operation** 
> beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. 
> 
> Voyager 1 is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), 
> or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, 
> and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086×1010 mi) from the Sun 
> reaching a distance of 162 AU (24.2 billion km; 15.1 billion mi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. 
> 
> As of 2024, Voyager 2 is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), 
> or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers from the Sun 
> reaching a distance of 136.627 AU (20.4 billion km; 12.7 billion mi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. 
>
> The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date 
> that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — 
> and Voyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from Earth.
