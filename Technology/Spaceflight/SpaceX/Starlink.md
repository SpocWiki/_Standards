> **Starlink** is a satellite internet constellation operated by Starlink Services, LLC, 
> a wholly owned subsidiary of American aerospace company SpaceX, 
> providing coverage to 102 countries. It also aims to provide global mobile broadband.
>
> SpaceX started launching Starlink satellites in 2019. 
> As of early March 2024, it consists of over 6,000 mass-produced small satellites 
> in low Earth orbit (LEO) that communicate with designated ground transceivers. 
> 
> Nearly 12,000 satellites are planned to be deployed, 
> with a possible later extension to 34,400. 
> SpaceX announced reaching more than 
> - 1 million subscribers in December 2022, 
> - 2 million subscribers in September 2023, and 
> - 3 million subscribers in May 2024.
>
> The SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington 
> houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control facilities. 
> In May 2018, SpaceX estimated the total cost of designing, building 
> and deploying the constellation would be at least US$10 billion. 
> Revenues from Starlink in 2022 were reportedly $1.4 billion accompanied by a net loss, 
> with a small profit being reported starting in 2023. 
> Revenue is expected to reach $6.6 billion in 2024.
>
> Starlink has been extensively used in the Russo-Ukrainian War, 
> a role for which it has been contracted by the United States Department of Defense. 
> [[Starshield]], a military version of Starlink, is designed for government use.
>
> Astronomers have raised concerns about 
> the effect the constellation may have on ground-based astronomy, 
> and how the satellites will contribute to an already congested orbital environment. 
> 
> SpaceX has attempted to mitigate astronometric interference concerns 
> with measures to reduce the satellites' brightness during operation. 
> 
> They are equipped with Hall-effect thrusters allowing them 
> to raise their orbit, station-keep, and de-orbit at the end of their lives. 
> They are also designed to autonomously 
> and smoothly avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.
