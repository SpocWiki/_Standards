## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A gravity assist, gravity assist maneuver, swing-by, 
> or generally a gravitational slingshot in orbital mechanics, 
> is a type of spaceflight flyby which makes use of the relative movement 
> (e.g. orbit around the Sun) and gravity of a planet or other astronomical object 
> to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically to save propellant and reduce expense.
>
> Gravity assistance can be used to accelerate a spacecraft, 
> that is, to increase or decrease its speed or redirect its path. 
> 
> The "assist" is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft. 
> 
> Any gain or loss of kinetic energy and linear momentum by a passing spacecraft 
> is correspondingly lost or gained by the gravitational body, 
> in accordance with Newton's Third Law. 
> 
> The gravity assist maneuver was first used in 1959 
> when the Soviet probe Luna 3 photographed the far side of Earth's Moon, 
> and it was used by interplanetary probes from Mariner 10 onward, 
> including the two Voyager probes' notable flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.
