## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics, **Spacetime**, also called the space-time continuum, 
> is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space 
> and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. 
> 
> Spacetime diagrams are useful in visualizing and understanding relativistic effects, 
> such as how different observers perceive where and when events occur.
>
> Until the turn of the 20th century, the assumption had been 
> that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe 
> (its description in terms of locations, shapes, distances, and directions) 
> was distinct from time (the measurement of when events occur within the universe). 
> 
> However, space and time took on new meanings 
> with the Lorentz transformation and special theory of relativity.
>
> In 1908, Hermann Minkowski presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity 
> that fused time and the three spatial dimensions into a single four-dimensional continuum 
> now known as Minkowski space. 
> 
> This interpretation proved vital to the general theory of relativity, 
> wherein spacetime is curved by mass and energy.
