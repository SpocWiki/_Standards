## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Proton (Russian: Протон, formal designation: UR-500) is an expendable launch system 
> used for both commercial and Russian government space launches. 
> 
> The first **Proton (rocket)** was launched in 1965. 
> Modern versions of the launch system are still in use as of 2023, 
> making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight. 
> 
> The components of all Protons are manufactured in 
> the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center factory in Moscow 
> and Chemical Automatics Design Bureau in Voronezh, 
> then transported to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, 
> where they are assembled at Site 91 to form the launch vehicle. 
> 
> Following payload integration, the rocket is then brought to the launch pad horizontally by rail, 
> and raised into vertical position for launch.
>
> As with many Soviet rockets, 
> the names of recurring payloads became associated with the launch vehicle itself. 
> The moniker "Proton" originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites, 
> which were among the rocket's first payloads. 
> During the Cold War, it was designated the D-1/D-1e or SL-12/SL-13 by Western intelligence agencies.
>
> Launch capacity to low Earth orbit is about 22.8 tonnes (50,000 lb). 
> Geostationary transfer capacity is about 6.3 tonnes (14,000 lb). 
> Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services (ILS).
>
> In 2013, the rocket was intended to be retired before 2030. 
> As of June 2018, production on the Proton rocket is ceasing 
> as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational. 
> No new launch service contracts for Proton are likely to be signed.
