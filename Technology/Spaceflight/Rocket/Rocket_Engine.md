## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A rocket engine is a reaction engine, producing thrust in accordance with Newton's third law 
> by ejecting reaction mass rearward, usually a high-speed jet of high-temperature gas 
> produced by the combustion of rocket propellants stored inside the rocket. 
> 
> However, non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters 
> and nuclear thermal rockets also exist. 
> 
> Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, 
> so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum, and they can achieve great speed, 
> beyond escape velocity. 
> 
> Vehicles commonly propelled by rocket engines include missiles, 
> artillery shells, ballistic missiles and rockets of any size, 
> from tiny fireworks to man-sized weapons to huge spaceships.
>
> Compared to other types of jet engine, 
> rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest thrust, 
> but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse). 
> 
> For thermal rockets, pure hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, 
> gives the highest exhaust velocity, 
> but practical chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity.
