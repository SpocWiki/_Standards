> Project Apollo, also the Apollo program (1961–1972), 
> was the United States' human spaceflight program led by NASA, 
> which landed the first astronauts on the Moon in 1969.

> In 1960, during the Eisenhower presidency (1953–1961), the Apollo Program was conceptualized to feature a three-astronaut spacecraft, and later was dedicated to Pres. Kennedy's national goal for NASA in the 1960s, of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth", proposed in a speech to the U.S. Congress on May 25, 1961.

> The Apollo 11 mission accomplished Kennedy's goal when the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) Eagle on the Moon on July 20, 1969, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM). All three astronauts landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969. Subsequently, five Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve astronauts walked on the Moon.

> Project Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed spaceflight in 1968, but earlier had suffered a disaster in 1967, when, during a pre-launching test, the Apollo 1 cabin atmosphere caught fire and killed the three astronauts. After the first Moon landing on 20 July, 1969, sufficient numbers of spacecraft and rockets remained for fielding nine landings on the Moon, with a plan for extended geological and astrophysical lunar exploration; but a reduced budget for NASA cancelled three planned lunar missions. Moreover, of the remaining six lunar missions, five landed on the Moon; but the Apollo 13 landing was aborted when an oxygen tank exploded and crippled the Apollo 13 CSM en route to the Moon. The resourceful crew of astronauts used the Lunar Module as a lifeboat to safely return from the Moon to the Earth.

> Project Apollo set several spaceflight milestones in the 1957–1969 period, sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, the Moon, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land astronauts on another celestial body. Project Apollo delivered 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, contributing to the geologic understanding of the Moon's composition and history. The Apollo program was the foundation for NASA's human spaceflight capabilities, housed at the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Apollo also advanced many technologies (avionics, telecommunications, computers) incidental to rocketry and to human spaceflight. Project Apollo used the models of Saturn rockets as the launching vehicles for the Apollo Applications Program, which comprised the space station Skylab (1973–1974), which supported the astronaut crews of three missions, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint U.S.–U.S.S.R. low Earth orbit mission in 1975.
