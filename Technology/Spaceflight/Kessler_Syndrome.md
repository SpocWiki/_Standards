## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Kessler syndrome, also known as the Kessler effect, collisional cascading, or ablation cascade, 
> is a scenario proposed by NASA scientists Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais in 1978. 
> 
> It describes a situation in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) 
> becomes so high due to space pollution that collisions between these objects cascade, 
> exponentially increasing the amount of space debris over time. 
> 
> This proliferation of debris poses significant risks to satellites, space missions, 
> and the International Space Station, potentially rendering certain orbital regions unusable 
> and threatening the sustainability of space activities for many generations. 
> 
> In 2009, Kessler wrote that modeling results indicated 
> the debris environment had already become unstable, 
> meaning that efforts to achieve a growth-free small debris environment 
> by eliminating past debris sources would likely fail 
> because fragments from future collisions would accumulate faster 
> than atmospheric drag could remove them. 
> 
> The Kessler syndrome underscores the critical need for effective space traffic management 
> and collision avoidance strategies to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration and utilization.
