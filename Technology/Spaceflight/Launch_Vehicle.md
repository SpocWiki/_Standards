## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A launch vehicle is typically a rocket-powered vehicle 
> designed to carry a payload (a crewed spacecraft or satellites) from Earth's surface 
> or lower atmosphere to outer space. 
> 
> The most common form is the ballistic missile-shaped multistage rocket, 
> but the term is more general and also encompasses vehicles like the Space Shuttle. 
> 
> Most launch vehicles operate from a launch pad, supported by a launch control center 
> and systems such as vehicle assembly and fueling. 
> Launch vehicles are engineered with advanced aerodynamics and technologies, 
> which contribute to high operating costs.
>
> An orbital launch vehicle must lift its payload at least to the boundary of space, 
> approximately 150 km (93 mi) and accelerate it to a horizontal velocity of at least 7,814 m/s (17,480 mph). Suborbital vehicles launch their payloads to lower velocity or are launched at elevation angles greater than horizontal.
>
> Practical orbital launch vehicles use chemical propellants such as solid fuel, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, liquid oxygen, or hypergolic propellants.
>
> Launch vehicles are classified by their orbital payload capacity, ranging from small-, medium-, heavy- to super-heavy lift.
