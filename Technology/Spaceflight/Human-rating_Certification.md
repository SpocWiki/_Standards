# [[Human-rating_Certification]] 

#is_/same_as :: [[WD~Human-rating_certification,5936797]] 

"Human-rated" is a term used primarily in aerospace and space exploration 
to describe a system, vehicle, or spacecraft that has been designed, tested, and certified 
to be **safe for human use**. 

The concept ensures that all aspects of the system can support human life, 
protect against hazardous environments, and minimize risks to human occupants. 

## Key Aspects of "Human-Rated":

### Safety and Redundancy 

Human-rated systems are designed with multiple layers of safety and redundancy. 
This means they often include backup systems for critical functions, 
so if one component fails, another can take over to ensure the safety of the crew.

### Life Support Systems 
The system must include mechanisms to support human life, 
such as breathable air, temperature control, and protection from radiation. 
It also requires provisions for handling emergency situations, like fire or depressurization.

### 3. **Risk Assessment and Management**
   - Extensive risk assessments are conducted to identify and mitigate potential hazards. Human-rated systems undergo rigorous testing, simulations, and operational procedures to minimize risks.

### 4. **Crew Escape and Abort Capabilities**
   - Human-rated vehicles often include systems that allow the crew to escape or abort the mission in the event of a catastrophic failure, protecting human life in extreme situations.

### Regulatory Certification 
In many cases, a human-rated system must meet the 
certification requirements of regulatory bodies like NASA or the FAA. 
For example, NASA has specific criteria for human-rating spacecraft and rockets, 
ensuring that they are safe for astronauts.

## Examples:
NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) and the [[../../../../_Standards/Technology/Spaceflight/NASA/NASA~Artemis/Orion_Spacecraft]] 
are human-rated for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.

The **SpaceX Crew Dragon** and **Boeing CST-100 Starliner** are human-rated spacecraft 
designed to safely carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).

## Difference from Non-Human Rated Systems:
Non-human-rated systems, like many satellites or cargo spacecraft, are not required to meet the same stringent safety standards because they don’t carry people. These systems may still have high reliability but don’t incorporate the same level of life support, redundancy, or emergency capabilities.

In short, **human-rated** signifies that a system is built to protect and support human life under extreme conditions, often in the context of space exploration or high-risk environments.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Human-rating certification, also known as man-rating or crew-rating, is the certification of a spacecraft or launch vehicle as capable of safely transporting humans. There is no one particular standard for human-rating a spacecraft or launch vehicle, and the various entities that launch or plan to launch such spacecraft specify requirements for their particular systems to be human-rated.
