> Technological convergence is the tendency for technologies that were originally unrelated 
> to become more closely integrated and even unified as they develop and advance. 
> 
> For example, watches, telephones, television, computers, and social media platforms 
> began as separate and mostly unrelated technologies, 
> but have converged in many ways into an interrelated telecommunication, media, 
> and technology industry.
