> The **Caravel** (Portuguese: caravela, IPA: [kɐɾɐˈvɛlɐ]) is a small sailing ship 
> developed by the Portuguese that may be rigged with just lateen sails, 
> or with a combination of lateen and square sails. 
> 
> It was known for its agility and speed and its capacity for sailing windward (beating). 
> Caravels were used by the Portuguese and Spanish 
> for the voyages of exploration during the 15th and 16th centuries, in the Age of Exploration.
>
> The caravel is a poorly understood type of vessel. 
> Though there are now some archaeologically investigated wrecks that are most likely caravels, 
> information on this type is limited. 
> We have a better understanding of the ships of the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity 
> than we do of the caravel.
