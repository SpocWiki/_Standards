> A **Trireme** ( TRY-reem; from Latin  trirēmis 'with three banks of oars'; cf. Ancient Greek: τριήρης, romanized: triḗrēs, lit. 'three-rower') was an ancient vessel and a type of galley that was used by the ancient maritime civilizations of the Mediterranean Sea, especially the Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and Romans.
>
> The trireme derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar. 
> The early trireme was a development of the penteconter, 
> an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side (i.e., a single-banked boat), 
> and of the bireme (Ancient Greek: διήρης, diērēs), a warship with two banks of oars, 
> of Phoenician origin. 
> The word dieres does not appear until the Roman period. According to Morrison and Williams, 
> "It must be assumed the term pentekontor covered the two-level type". 
> 
> As a ship, it was fast and agile and was the dominant warship in the Mediterranean 
> from the 7th to the 4th centuries BC, 
> after which it was largely superseded by the larger quadriremes and quinqueremes. 
> 
> Triremes played a vital role in the Persian Wars, the creation of the Athenian maritime empire 
> and its downfall during the Peloponnesian War.
>
> Medieval and early modern galleys with three files of oarsmen per side 
> are sometimes referred to as triremes.
