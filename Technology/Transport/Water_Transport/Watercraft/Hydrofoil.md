# [[Hydrofoil]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Hydrofoil** is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water. 
> 
> They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes. 
> 
> Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils. 
> As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, 
> decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds.
