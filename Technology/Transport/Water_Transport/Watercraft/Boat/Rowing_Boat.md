## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Rowing is the act of propelling a human-powered watercraft 
> using the sweeping motions of oars to displace water and generate reactional propulsion. 
> 
> Rowing is functionally similar to paddling, 
> but rowing requires oars to be mechanically attached to the boat, 
> and the rower drives the oar like a lever, 
> exerting force in the same direction as the boat's travel; 
> while paddles are completely hand-held and have no attachment to the boat, 
> and are driven like a cantilever, exerting force opposite to the intended direction of the boat.
>
> In some strict terminologies, using oars for propulsion may be termed either "pulling" or "rowing", with different definitions for each. Where these strict terminologies are used, the definitions are reversed depending on the context. On saltwater a "pulling boat" has each person working one oar on one side, alternating port and starboard along the length of the boat; whilst "rowing" means each person operates two oars, one on each side of the boat. On inland waterways, the opposite applies, with "rowing" being where each person in a crew works one oar and "sculling" (especially in sport rowing) involves each participant using a pair of oars. In a maritime setting "sculling" means propelling a boat with a single oar operated over the stern.
>
> This article focuses on the general types of rowing, such as recreation and transport rather than the sport of competitive rowing, which is a specialized case of boat racing using strictly regulated equipment and a highly refined technique.
