> A tanker (or tank ship or tankship) is a ship 
> designed to transport or store liquids or gases in bulk.  
> 
> Major types of **Tanker (ship)** include the oil tanker (or petroleum tanker), 
> the chemical tanker, cargo ships, and a gas carrier. 
> Tankers also carry commodities such as vegetable oils, molasses and wine. 
>
> In the United States Navy and Military Sealift Command, 
> a tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler 
> (or replenishment oiler if it can also supply dry stores) 
> but many other navies use the terms tanker and replenishment tanker. 
>
> Tankers were first developed in the late 19th century as iron and steel hulls 
> and pumping systems were developed. 
> 
> As of 2005, there were just over 4,000 tankers 
> and supertankers 10,000 LT DWT or greater operating worldwide.
