> A junk (Chinese: 䑸; pinyin: zōng) is a type of Chinese sailing ship 
> characterized by a central rudder, an overhanging flat transom, 
> watertight bulkheads, and a flat-bottomed design. 
> 
> They are also characteristically built using iron nails and clamps. 
> The term applies to many types of small coastal or river ships, 
> usually serving as cargo ships, pleasure boats, or houseboats, 
> but also going up in size up to large ocean-going vessels. 
> There can be significant regional variations in the type of rig and the layout of the vessel.
>
> Chinese junks were originally only fluvial and had square sails, 
> but by the Song dynasty  (c. 960 to 1279), 
> they adopted ocean-going technologies acquired from Southeast Asian k'un-lun po trade ships. 
> Tanja sails and fully battened junk rigs were introduced to Chinese junks by the 12th century CE.
>
> Similar designs to the Chinese junk were also adopted by other East Asian countries, 
> most notably Japan, where junks were used as merchant ships to trade goods with China and Southeast Asia.
