> A **Raft** is any flat structure for support or transportation over water. 
> It is usually of basic design, characterized by the absence of a hull. 
> 
> Rafts are usually kept afloat by using any combination of buoyant materials 
> such as wood, sealed barrels, or inflated air chambers (such as pontoons), 
> and are typically not propelled by an engine. 
> 
> Rafts are an ancient mode of transport; 
> naturally occurring rafts such as entwined vegetation and pieces of wood 
> have been used to traverse water since the dawn of humanity.
