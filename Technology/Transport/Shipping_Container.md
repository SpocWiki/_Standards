> An intermodal container, often called a shipping container, or a freight container, 
> (or simply "container") is a large metal crate designed 
> and built for intermodal freight transport, 
> meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – 
> such as from ships to trains to trucks – without unloading and reloading their cargo. 
> 
> Intermodal containers are primarily used to 
> store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely 
> in the global containerized intermodal freight transport system, 
> but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. 
> It is like a boxcar that does not have wheels. 
> 
> Based on size alone, up to 95% of intermodal containers comply with ISO standards, 
> and can officially be called ISO containers. 
> These containers are known by many names: cargo container, sea container, ocean container, container van or sea van, sea can or C can, or MILVAN, or SEAVAN. 
> 
> The term CONEX (Box) is a technically incorrect carry-over usage 
> of the name of an important predecessor of the ISO containers: 
> the much smaller steel CONEX boxes used by the U.S. Army.
>
> Intermodal containers exist in many types and standardized sizes, 
> but 90 percent of the global container fleet are "dry freight" or "general purpose" containers: 
> durable closed rectangular boxes, made of rust-retardant weathering steel; 
> almost all 8 feet (2.4 m) wide, and of either 20 or 40 feet (6.1 or 12.2 m) standard length, 
> as defined by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 668:2020. 
> The worldwide standard heights are 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 m) and 9 feet 6 inches (2.9 m) – 
> the latter are known as High Cube or Hi-Cube (HC or HQ) containers. 
> Depending on the source, these containers may be termed TEUs 
> (twenty-foot equivalent units), reflecting the 20- or 40-foot dimensions.
>
> Invented in the early 20th century, 
> 40-foot intermodal containers proliferated during the 1960s and 1970s 
> under the containerization innovations of the American shipping company SeaLand. 
> Like cardboard boxes and pallets, these containers are a means to bundle cargo and goods 
> into larger, unitized loads that can be easily handled, moved, and stacked, 
> and that will pack tightly in a ship or yard. 
> 
> Intermodal containers share a number of construction features 
> to withstand the stresses of intermodal shipping, to facilitate their handling, 
> and to allow stacking. Each has a unique ISO 6346 reporting mark.
>
> In 2012, there were about 20.5 million intermodal containers in the world 
> of varying types to suit different cargoes. 
> Containers have largely supplanted the traditional break bulk cargo; 
> in 2010, containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. 
> The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo, 
> whether gaseous, liquid, or solid—e.g., by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car, or truck. 
> For air freight, the lighter weight IATA-defined unit load devices are used.
