## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Maglev (derived from magnetic levitation) is a system of rail transport 
> whose rolling stock is levitated by electromagnets rather than rolled on wheels, 
> eliminating rolling resistance.
>
> Compared to conventional railways, maglev trains have higher top speeds, 
> superior acceleration and deceleration, lower maintenance costs, 
> improved gradient handling, and lower noise. 
> However, they are more expensive to build, cannot use existing infrastructure, 
> and use more energy at high speeds.
>
> Maglev trains have set several speed records. The train speed record of 603 km/h (375 mph) 
> was set by the experimental Japanese L0 Series maglev in 2015. 
> From 2002 until 2021, the record for the highest operational speed of a passenger train 
> of 431 kilometres per hour (268 mph) was held by the Shanghai maglev train, 
> which uses German Transrapid technology. 
> 
> The service connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport 
> and the outskirts of central Pudong, Shanghai. 
> At its historical top speed, it covered the distance of 30.5 kilometres (19 mi) 
> in just over 8 minutes (average speed: 228.75 km/h).
>
> Different maglev systems achieve levitation in different ways, 
> which broadly fall into two categories: 
> electromagnetic suspension (EMS) and electrodynamic suspension (EDS). 
> 
> Propulsion is typically provided by a linear motor. 
> The power needed for levitation is typically 
> **not a large percentage of the overall energy** consumption of a high-speed maglev system. 
> Instead, overcoming drag takes the most energy. 
> Vactrain technology has been proposed as a means to overcome this limitation.
>
> Despite over a century of research and development, 
> there are only seven operational maglev trains today — 
> four in China, two in South Korea, and one in Japan.
>
> Two inter-city maglev lines are currently under construction, 
> the Chūō Shinkansen connecting Tokyo and Nagoya, 
> and a line between Changsha and Liuyang in Hunan Province, China.
