> Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transport 
> using wheeled vehicles running in tracks, which usually consist of two parallel steel rails. 
> 
> Rail transport is one of the two primary means of land transport, next to road transport. 
> 
> It is used for about 8% of passenger and freight transport globally, 
> thanks to its energy efficiency and potentially high speed. 
> 
> Also, the track spreads the weight of the train 
> which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks on roads.
> 
> Rolling stock on rails generally encounters lower frictional resistance 
> than rubber-tyred road vehicles, allowing rail cars to be coupled into longer trains. 
> 
> Power is usually provided by diesel or electric locomotives. 
> While **Railway** transport is capital-intensive and less flexible than road transport, 
> it can carry heavy loads of passengers and cargo with greater energy efficiency and safety.
>
> Precursors of railways driven by human or animal power, have existed since antiquity, 
> but modern rail transport began with the invention of the steam locomotive 
> in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the 19th century. 
> 
> The first passenger railway, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825. 
> The quick spread of railways throughout Europe and North America, 
> following the 1830 opening of the first intercity connection in England, 
> was a key component of the Industrial Revolution. 
> 
> The adoption of rail transport lowered shipping costs 
> compared to transport by water or wagon, 
> and led to "national markets" in which prices varied less from city to city.
>
> Railroads not only increased the speed of transport, 
> they also dramatically lowered its cost. 
> 
> For example, the first transcontinental railroad in the United States 
> resulted in passengers and freight being able to cross the country in a matter of days 
> instead of months and at one tenth the cost of stagecoach or wagon transport. 
> 
> With economical transportation in the West 
> (which had been referred to as the Great American Desert), 
> now farming, ranching and mining could be done at a profit. 
> As a result, railroads transformed the country, particularly the West 
> (which had few navigable rivers).
>
> In the 1880s, railway electrification began with tramways and rapid transit systems. 
> Starting in the 1940s, steam locomotives were replaced by diesel locomotives. 
> The first high-speed railway system was introduced in Japan in 1964, 
> and high-speed rail lines now connect many cities in Europe, East Asia, and the eastern United States. 
> 
> Following some decline due to competition from cars and aeroplanes, 
> rail transport has had a revival in recent decades 
> due to road congestion and rising fuel prices, 
> as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing CO2 emissions.
