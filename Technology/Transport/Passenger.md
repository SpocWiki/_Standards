> A **Passenger** is a person who travels in a vehicle, 
> but does not bear any responsibility for the tasks required 
> for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle, 
> and is not a steward. 
> 
> The vehicles may be bicycles, buses, cars, passenger trains, airliners, ships, ferryboats, personal watercraft, all terrain vehicles, snowmobiles,  and other methods of transportation.
>
> Crew members (if any), as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle, 
> are usually not considered to be passengers. 
> 
> For example, a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a passenger 
> while on duty and the same with those working in the kitchen or restaurant on board a ship as well as cleaning staff, but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger, even if the car was being driven on company business.
