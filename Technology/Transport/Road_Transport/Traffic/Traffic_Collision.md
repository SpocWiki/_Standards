## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision or car crash, occurs 
> when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, 
> or other moving or stationary obstruction, such as a tree, pole or building. 
> 
> Traffic collisions often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage 
> as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved. 
> 
> Road transport is 
> statistically the most dangerous situation people deal with on a daily basis, 
> but casualty figures from such incidents attract less media attention 
> than other, less frequent types of tragedy. 
> 
> The commonly used term car accident is increasingly falling out of favor 
> with many government departments and organizations: 
> the Associated Press style guide recommends caution before using the term 
> and the National Union of Journalists advises against it 
> in their Road Collision Reporting Guidelines. 
> 
> Some collisions are intentional vehicle-ramming attacks, 
> staged crashes, vehicular homicide or vehicular suicide.
>
> Several factors contribute to the risk of collisions, including 
> - vehicle design, 
> - speed of operation, 
> - road design, 
> - weather, 
> - road environment, 
> - driving skills, 
> - impairment due to alcohol or drugs, 
> and behavior, notably 
> - aggressive driving, 
> - distracted driving, 
> - speeding and 
> - street racing.
>
> In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions. 
> This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990. 
> 
> About 68,000 of these occurred with children less than five years old. 
> Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, 
> while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions. 
> 
> Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, 
> accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles. 
> While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), 
> the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants).
