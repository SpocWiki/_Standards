> A **Carriage** is a two- or four-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle for passengers. 
> In Europe they were a common mode of transport for the wealthy during the Roman Empire, 
> and then again from around 1600 until they were replaced by the motor car around 1900. 
> 
> They were generally owned by the rich, 
> but second-hand private carriages became common public transport, 
> the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis. 
> Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping or, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs. 
> There are numerous names for different types. Two-wheeled carriages are usually owner-driven.
>
> Coaches are a special category within carriages. 
> They are carriages with four corner posts and a fixed roof. 
> Two-wheeled war chariots and transport vehicles such as four-wheeled wagons 
> and two-wheeled carts were forerunners of carriages.
>
> In the 21st century, horse-drawn carriages are occasionally used for public parades by royalty and for traditional formal ceremonies. Simplified modern versions are made for tourist transport in warm countries and for those cities where tourists expect open horse-drawn carriages to be provided. Simple metal sporting versions are still made for the sport known as competitive driving.
