## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Trail**, also known as a path or track, is an unpaved lane or a small paved road 
> (though it can also be a route along a navigable waterways) generally 
> not intended for usage by motorized vehicles, usually passing through a natural area. 
> However, it is sometimes applied to highways in North America. 
>
> In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a path or footpath 
> is the preferred term for a pedestrian or hiking trail. 
> 
> In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory 
> used by explorers and migrants (e.g. the Oregon Trail).  
> In the United States, "trace" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace.
>
> Some trails are restricted to use by only walkers, or cyclists, or equestrians, 
> or for snowshoeing, or cross-country skiing, others, for example 
> bridleways in the UK, are shared, and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians. 
> 
> Although most ban motorized use, there are unpaved trails used by dirt bikes, 
> quad bikes and other off-road vehicles, usually for extreme sports and rally races. 
> 
> In some places, like the Alps, trails are used by alpine agrarian communities 
> for moving cattle and other livestock.
