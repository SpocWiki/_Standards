> The **Volkswagen Beetle**, officially the Volkswagen Type 1, 
> is a small family car produced by the German company Volkswagen from 1938 to 2003. 
> 
> A global cultural icon known for its bug-like design, 
> the Beetle is widely regarded as one of the most influential cars of the 20th century. 
> 
> Its production period of 65 years is the longest for any single generation of automobile, 
> and its total production of 21.5 million units 
> makes it the most produced car of a single platform in history 
> and the second-highest of all nameplates manufactured in the 20th century.
>
> The Beetle was conceived in the early 1930s. 
> The leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, decided there was a need for a people's car—
> an inexpensive, simple, mass-produced car—to serve Germany's new road network, the Reichsautobahn. 
> 
> The German engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his design team 
> began developing and designing the car in the early 1930s, 
> but the fundamental design concept can be attributed to Béla Barényi in 1925, 
> predating Porsche's claims by almost ten years. 
> 
> The result was the Volkswagen Type 1 and the introduction of the Volkswagen brand. 
> Volkswagen initially slated production for the late 1930s, but the outbreak of war in 1939 meant that 
> production was delayed until the war had ended. 
> 
> The car was originally called the Volkswagen Type 1 and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. 
> It was not until 1968 that it was officially named the "Beetle".
>
> Volkswagen implemented designations for the Beetle in the 1960s, 
> including 1200, 1300, 1500, 1600, 1302, and 1303. 
> 
> Volkswagen introduced a series of large luxury models throughout the 1960s and 1970s—
> comprising the Type 3, Type 4 and K70—to supplement the Beetle, 
> but none of these models achieved the level of success that it did. 
> 
> In 1972, it became the best-selling car of all time, a position it retained for nearly three decades. 
> Rapidly changing consumer preferences toward front-wheel drive compact hatchbacks in Europe 
> prompted Volkswagen's gradual shift away from rear-wheel drive, starting with the Golf in 1974. 
> 
> In the late 1970s and '80s, Japanese automakers dominated some markets around the world, 
> which contributed to the Beetle's declining popularity.
>
> The Beetle remains one of the best-selling cars of all time and is the first to sell over 20 million units. 
> 
> Over its lifespan, its design remained consistent, 
> yet Volkswagen implemented over 78,000 incremental updates. 
> 
> These modifications were often subtle, involving 
> minor alterations to its exterior, interior, colours, and lighting. 
> 
> Some more noteworthy changes included the introduction of 
> new engines, models and systems, such as improved technology or comfort. 
> 
> The Beetle maintains a substantial cultural influence 
> and is regarded as one of the most iconic vehicles in automotive history; 
> its success largely influenced the way automobiles are designed and marketed, 
> and propelled Volkswagen's introduction of a Golf-based series of vehicles.
