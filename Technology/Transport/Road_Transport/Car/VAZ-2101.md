> The **VAZ-2101** "Zhiguli", commonly nicknamed  "Kopeyka" 
> (for the smallest Soviet coin, 1/100 of the Russian ruble), 
> is a compact 4-door sedan or wagon, called small class, passenger car, model 1 
> in Soviet classification, and produced by the Soviet manufacturer AvtoVAZ, 
> introduced in 1970 as the company's first product.
>
> The car is a licence-built version of the Fiat 124, 
> that was heavily modified and tailored for the rough climate 
> and road conditions across the Soviet Union and much of the Eastern Bloc countries. 
> 
> Subsequently, it was widely, and successfully exported to the West 
> under the Lada brand, for over two decades. 
> The station wagon version (correspondingly based on the Fiat 124 Familiare) 
> was known as the VAZ-2102.
