> An electric car or electric vehicle (EV) is a passenger automobile 
> that is propelled by an electric traction motor, 
> using electrical energy as the primary source of propulsion. 
> 
> The term normally refers to a plug-in electric vehicle, typically a battery electric vehicle (BEV), 
> which only uses energy stored in on-board battery packs, 
> but broadly may also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), 
> range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), 
> which can convert electric power from other fuels via a generator or a fuel cell.
>
> Compared to conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, 
> electric cars are quieter, more responsive, have superior energy conversion efficiency 
> and no exhaust emissions, as well as a typically lower overall carbon footprint 
> from manufacturing to end of life 
> (even when a fossil-fuel power plant supplying the electricity might add to its emissions). 
> Due to the superior efficiency of electric motors, electric cars also generate less waste heat, 
> thus reducing the need for engine cooling systems that are often large, 
> complicated and maintenance-prone in ICE vehicles.
>
> The electric vehicle battery typically needs to be plugged into a mains electricity power supply 
> for recharging in order to maximize the cruising range. 
> Recharging an electric car can be done at different kinds of charging stations; 
> these charging stations can be installed in private homes, parking garages and public areas. 
> There is also research and development in, as well as deployment of, other technologies 
> such as battery swapping and inductive charging. 
> 
> As the recharging infrastructure (especially fast chargers) is still in its infancy, 
> range anxiety and time cost are frequent psychological obstacles 
> during consumer purchasing decisions against electric cars.
>
> Worldwide, 14 million plug-in electric cars were sold in 2023, 18% of new car sales, up from 14% in 2022. 
> 
> Many countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, 
> tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives 
> while several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars, 
> to reduce air pollution and limit climate change. 
> 
> EVs are expected to account for over one-fifth of global car sales in 2024.
>
> China currently has the largest stock of electric vehicles in the world, 
> with cumulative sales of 5.5 million units through December 2020, 
> although these figures also include heavy-duty commercial vehicles 
> such as buses, garbage trucks and sanitation vehicles, 
> and only accounts for vehicles manufactured in China. 
> 
> In the United States and the European Union, as of 2020, 
> the total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, 
> due to lower fueling and maintenance costs.
>
> In 2023, the Tesla Model Y became the world's best selling car. 
> The Tesla Model 3 became the world's all-time best-selling electric car in early 2020, 
> and in June 2021 became the first electric car to pass 1 million global sales. 
> 
> Together with other emerging automotive technologies such as autonomous driving, 
> connected vehicles and shared mobility, 
> electric cars form a future mobility vision called Autonomous, Connected, Electric and Shared (ACES) Mobility.
