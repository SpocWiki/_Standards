> A **Chariot** is a type of vehicle similar to a cart, driven by a charioteer, 
> usually using horses to provide rapid motive power. 
> 
> The oldest known chariots have been found in burials of the Sintashta culture 
> in modern-day Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, dated to c. 1950–1880 BC 
> and are depicted on cylinder seals from Central Anatolia in Kültepe dated to c. 1900 BC. 
> The critical invention that allowed the construction of light, horse-drawn chariots was the spoked wheel.
>
> The chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled conveyance 
> drawn by two or more equids (usually horses) that were hitched side by side, 
> and was little more than a floor with a waist-high guard at the front and sides. 
> It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages, 
> but after its military capabilities had been superseded by light and heavy cavalries, 
> chariots continued to be used for travel and transport, in processions, for games, and in races.
