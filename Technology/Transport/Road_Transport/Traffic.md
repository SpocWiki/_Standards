## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Traffic** comprises pedestrians, vehicles, ridden or herded animals, trains, and other 
> conveyances that use public ways (roads/sidewalks) for travel and transportation. 
>
> Traffic laws govern and regulate traffic, while rules of the road 
> include traffic laws and informal rules that may have developed over time 
> to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic. 
> 
> Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, 
> and traffic control at intersections. (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions 
> at Sea govern the oceans and influence some laws for navigating domestic waters.)
>
> Traffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with 
> marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, cones, or signs. 
> 
> Traffic is often classified by type: 
> heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. 
> 
> Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated. 
> Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road 
> while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate.
>
> Organization typically produces a better combination of travel safety and efficiency. 
> 
> Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into 
> a disorganized mess include road construction, collisions, and debris in the roadway. 
> 
> On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in 
> a phenomenon known as traffic waves. 
> 
> A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and gridlock. 
> Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, 
> stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.
