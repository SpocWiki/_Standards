> A **Pipe** is a tubular section or hollow cylinder, 
> usually but not necessarily of circular cross-section, 
> used mainly to convey substances which can flow — liquids and gases (fluids), 
> slurries, powders and masses of small solids. 
> 
> It can also be used for structural applications; 
> a hollow pipe is far stiffer per unit weight than the solid members.
>
> In common usage the words pipe and tube are usually interchangeable, 
> but in industry and engineering, the terms are uniquely defined. 
> 
> Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured, 
> pipe is generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter (OD) 
> and a schedule that defines the thickness.  
> 
> Tube is most often specified by the OD and wall thickness, 
> but may be specified by any two of OD, inside diameter (ID), and wall thickness. 
> 
> Pipe is generally manufactured to one of several international and national industrial standards. While similar standards exist for specific industry application tubing, tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of diameters and tolerances. Many industrial and government standards exist for the production of pipe and tubing. The term "tube" is  also commonly applied to non-cylindrical sections, i.e., square or rectangular tubing. In general, "pipe" is the more common term in most of the world, whereas "tube" is more widely used in the United States.
>
> Both "pipe" and "tube" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, 
> whereas a hose (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible. 
> 
> Pipe assemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as 
> elbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom configurations. 
> 
> For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where construction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also constructed with the use of tube fittings.
