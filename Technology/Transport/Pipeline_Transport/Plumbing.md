> **Plumbing** is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications. 
> Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids.  
> 
> Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery 
> are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications.  
> The word derives from the Latin for lead, plumbum, 
> as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.
>
> In the developed world, plumbing infrastructure is critical to public health and sanitation.
>
> Boilermakers and pipefitters are not plumbers 
> although they work with piping as part of their trade 
> and their work can include some plumbing.
