## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Tourism** is travel for pleasure, 
> and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.  
> 
> UN Tourism defines tourism more generally, in terms which 
> go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", 
> as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment 
> for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". 
> 
> Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international. 
> International tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications 
> on a country's balance of payments.
>
> Between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, 
> tourism numbers declined due to a severe economic slowdown (see [[Great Recession]]) 
> and the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. 
> 
> These numbers, however, recovered 
> until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. 
> 
> The United Nations World Tourism Organization has estimated that 
> global international tourist arrivals might have decreased by 58% to 78% in 2020, 
> leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.
>
> Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) 
> grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, 
> corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. 
> 
> International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally 
> for the first time in 2012. 
> 
> Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil 
> had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.
>
> Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. 
> Emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts 
> are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. 
> 
> Many tourist development organizations are shifting focus to sustainable tourism 
> to minimize the negative effects of growing tourism. 
> 
> This approach aims 
> to balance economic benefits with environmental and social responsibility. 
> 
> The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices 
> by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
> through programs such as the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017.
