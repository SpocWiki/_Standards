> A **Tunnel** is an underground or undersea passageway. 
> 
> It is dug through surrounding soil, earth or rock, or laid under water, 
> and is usually completely enclosed except for the two portals common at each end, 
> though there may be access and ventilation openings at various points along the length. 
> 
> A pipeline differs significantly from a tunnel, 
> though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques 
> rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.
>
> A tunnel may be for foot or vehicular road traffic, for rail traffic, or for a canal. 
> The central portions of a rapid transit network are usually in the tunnel. 
> Some tunnels are used as sewers or aqueducts 
> to supply water for consumption or for hydroelectric stations. 
> Utility tunnels are used for routing steam, chilled water, 
> electrical power or telecommunication cables, 
> as well as connecting buildings for convenient passage of people and equipment.
>
> Secret tunnels are built for military purposes, 
> or by civilians for smuggling of weapons, contraband, or people. 
> Special tunnels, such as wildlife crossings, 
> are built to allow wildlife to cross human-made barriers safely. 
> Tunnels can be connected together in tunnel networks.
>
> A tunnel is relatively long and narrow; the length is often much greater than twice the diameter, 
> although similar shorter excavations can be constructed, 
> such as cross passages between tunnels. 
> 
> The definition of what constitutes a tunnel can vary widely from source to source. 
> For example, in the United Kingdom, a road tunnel is defined as 
> "a subsurface highway structure enclosed for a length of 150 metres (490 ft) or more." 
> 
> In the United States, the NFPA definition of a tunnel is 
> "An underground structure with a design length greater than 23 m (75 ft) 
> and a diameter greater than 1,800 millimetres (5.9 ft)."
