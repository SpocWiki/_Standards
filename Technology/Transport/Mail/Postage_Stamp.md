> A postage stamp is a small piece of paper issued by a post office, postal administration, 
> or other authorized vendors to customers who pay postage 
> (the cost involved in moving, insuring, or registering mail). 
> 
> Then the stamp is affixed to the face or address-side of any item of mail—
> an envelope or other postal cover (e.g., packet, box, mailing cylinder)—which they wish to send. 
> 
> The item is then processed by the postal system, where a postmark or cancellation mark—
> in modern usage indicating date and point of origin of mailing—is applied to the stamp 
> and its left and right sides to prevent its reuse. Next the item is delivered to its address.
>
> Always featuring the name of the issuing nation (with the exception of the United Kingdom), 
> a denomination of its value, and often an illustration of persons, events, institutions, 
> or natural realities that symbolize the nation's traditions and values, 
> every stamp is printed on a piece of usually rectangular, 
> but sometimes triangular or otherwise shaped special custom-made paper 
> whose back is either glazed with an adhesive gum or self-adhesive.
>
> Because governments issue stamps of different denominations in unequal numbers 
> and routinely discontinue some lines and introduce others, and because of their illustrations 
> and association with the social and political realities of the time of their issue, 
> they are often prized for their beauty and historical significance by stamp collectors, 
> whose study of their history and of mailing systems is called philately. 
> 
> Because collectors often buy stamps from an issuing agency 
> with no intention to use them for postage, 
> the revenues from such purchases and payments of postage 
> can make them a source of net profit to that agency. 
> 
> On 1 May 1840, Sir Rowland Hill invented the Penny Black, 
> the first adhesive postage stamp issued in the United Kingdom, 
> selecting a simple design that showed Queen Victoria's profile, 
> the artist Henry Corbould draw her image, basing his work on a medal by William Wyon. 
> 
> Perkins, Bacon & Petch, a leading security printing firm printed the stamp. 
> Within three years postage stamps were introduced in Switzerland and Brazil, 
> a little later in the United States, and by 1860, they were in 90 countries around the world. 
> 
> The first postage stamps did not need to show the issuing country, 
> so no country name was included on them. 
> 
> Thus the United Kingdom remains the only country in the world 
> to omit its name on postage stamps; 
> the monarch's image signifies the United Kingdom as the country of origin.
