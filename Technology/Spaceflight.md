> Space exploration is the physical investigation of outer space 
> by uncrewed robotic space probes and through human spaceflight.
>
> While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, 
> it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century 
> that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. 
> 
> Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, 
> national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, 
> and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.
>
> The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" in which the Soviet Union 
> and the United States vied to demonstrate their technological superiority. 
> 
> Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, 
> the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, 
> and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969. 
> 
> The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including 
> - the first living being in orbit in 1957, 
> - the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, 
> - the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, 
> - the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and 
> - the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. 
>
> In the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, 
> such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation, 
> the foremost example being the International Space Station (ISS), built between 1998 and 2011.
>
> The 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs of China, 
> the European Union, Japan, and India. 
> 
> The 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest 
> with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. 
> 
> In the 2020s, the two primary global programs gaining traction are Moon-focused: 
> - the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station 
> - and the U.S.-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp, each with a set of international partners.
