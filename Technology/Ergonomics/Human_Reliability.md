> In the field of human factors and ergonomics, human reliability 
> (also known as human performance or HU) 
> is the probability that a human performs a task to a sufficient standard. 
> 
> Reliability of humans can be affected by many factors such as 
> age, physical health, mental state, attitude, emotions, personal propensity for certain mistakes, and cognitive biases.
>
> Human reliability is important to the resilience of socio-technical systems, 
> and has implications for fields like manufacturing, medicine and nuclear power.  
> 
> Attempts made to decrease human error 
> and increase reliability in human interaction with technology 
> include user-centered design and error-tolerant design.
