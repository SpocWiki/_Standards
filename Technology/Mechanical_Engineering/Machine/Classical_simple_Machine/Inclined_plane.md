> An inclined plane, also known as a ramp, is a flat supporting surface 
> tilted at an angle from the vertical direction, with one end higher than the other, 
> used as an aid for raising or lowering a load. 
> 
> The inclined plane is one of the six [[Classical_simple_Machine]] defined by Renaissance scientists. 
> Inclined planes are used to move heavy loads over vertical obstacles. 
> Examples vary from a ramp used to load goods into a truck, 
> to a person walking up a pedestrian ramp, to an automobile or railroad train climbing a grade.
>
> Moving an object up an inclined plane requires less force than lifting it straight up, 
> at a cost of an increase in the distance moved. 
> The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane, the factor by which the force is reduced, 
> is equal to the ratio of the length of the sloped surface to the height it spans. 
> 
> Owing to conservation of energy, the same amount of mechanical energy (work) is required to lift a given object by a given vertical distance, disregarding losses from friction, but the inclined plane allows the same work to be done with a smaller force exerted over a greater distance.
>
> The angle of friction, also sometimes called the angle of repose, is the maximum angle at which a load can rest motionless on an inclined plane due to friction without sliding down. This angle is equal to the arctangent of the coefficient of static friction Î¼s between the surfaces.
>
> Two other simple machines are often considered to be derived from the inclined plane. The wedge can be considered a moving inclined plane or two inclined planes connected at the base. The screw consists of a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.
>
> The term may also refer to a specific implementation; a straight ramp cut into a steep hillside for transporting goods up and down the hill. This may include cars on rails or pulled up by a cable system; a funicular or cable railway, such as the Johnstown Inclined Plane.
