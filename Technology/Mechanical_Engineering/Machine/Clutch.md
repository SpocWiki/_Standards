## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Clutch** is a mechanical device that allows an output shaft 
> to be disconnected from a rotating input shaft. 
> 
> The clutch's input shaft is typically attached to a motor, 
> while the clutch's output shaft is connected to the mechanism that does the work.
>
> In a motor vehicle, the clutch acts as a mechanical linkage between the engine and transmission. 
> By disengaging the clutch, the engine speed (RPM) 
> is no longer determined by the speed of the driven wheels.
>
> Another example of clutch usage is in electric drills. The clutch's input shaft is driven by a motor and the output shaft is connected to the drill bit (via several intermediate components). The clutch allows the drill bit to either spin at the same speed as the motor (clutch engaged), spin at a lower speed than the motor (clutch slipping) or remain stationary while the motor is spinning (clutch disengaged).
