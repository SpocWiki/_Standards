## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Machine** is a physical system that uses power to apply forces and control movement 
> to perform an action. 
> 
> The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such as those employing engines or motors, 
> but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines. 
> 
> Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, 
> and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, 
> and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input 
> to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement. 
> They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, 
> often called mechanical systems.
>
> Renaissance natural philosophers identified [[Simple_Machine]] 
> which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, 
> and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.
>
> Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use. Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as trains, automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots.
