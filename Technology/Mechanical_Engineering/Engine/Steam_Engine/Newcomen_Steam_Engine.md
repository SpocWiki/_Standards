> The atmospheric engine was invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, 
> and is often referred to as the Newcomen fire engine (see below) or simply as a Newcomen engine. 
> 
> The engine was operated by condensing steam drawn into the cylinder, 
> thereby creating a partial vacuum which allowed the atmospheric pressure 
> to push the piston into the cylinder. 
> 
> It was historically significant as the first practical device to harness steam to produce mechanical work.  
> Newcomen engines were used throughout Britain and Europe, principally to pump water out of mines. 
> Hundreds were constructed throughout the 18th century.
>
> James Watt's later engine design was an improved version of the Newcomen engine 
> that roughly doubled fuel efficiency. 
> Many atmospheric engines were converted to the Watt design, 
> for a price which was based on a fraction of the fuel-savings. 
> As a result, Watt is today better known than Newcomen in relation to the origin of the steam engine.
