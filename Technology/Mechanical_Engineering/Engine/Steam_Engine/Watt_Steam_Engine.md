> The Watt steam engine design was an invention of James Watt 
> that became synonymous with steam engines during the Industrial Revolution, 
> and it was many years before significantly new designs began to replace the basic Watt design.
>
> The first steam engines, introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, were of the "atmospheric" design. 
> At the end of the power stroke, the weight of the object being moved by the engine 
> pulled the piston to the top of the cylinder as steam was introduced. 
> 
> Then the cylinder was cooled by a spray of water, which caused the steam to condense, 
> forming a partial vacuum in the cylinder. 
> 
> Atmospheric pressure on the top of the piston pushed it down, lifting the work object. 
> James Watt noticed that it required significant amounts of heat to __warm the cylinder back up__ 
> to the point where steam could enter the cylinder without immediately condensing. 
> When the cylinder was warm enough that it became filled with steam 
> the next power stroke could commence.
>
> Watt realised that the heat needed to warm the cylinder could be saved 
> by __adding a separate condensing cylinder__. 
> After the power cylinder was filled with steam, a valve was opened to the secondary cylinder, 
> allowing the steam to flow into it and be condensed, 
> which drew the steam from the main cylinder causing the power stroke. 
> 
> The condensing cylinder was water cooled to keep the steam condensing. 
> At the end of the power stroke, the valve was closed 
> so the power cylinder could be filled with steam as the piston moved to the top. 
> The result was the same cycle as Newcomen's design, 
> but without any cooling of the power cylinder which was immediately ready for another stroke.
>
> Watt worked on the design over a period of several years, introducing the condenser, 
> and introducing improvements to practically every part of the design. 
> 
> Notably, Watt performed a lengthy series of trials on ways to seal the piston in the cylinder, 
> which considerably reduced leakage during the power stroke, preventing power loss. 
> All of these changes produced a more reliable design 
> which used half as much coal to produce the same amount of power.
>
> The new design was introduced commercially in 1776, 
> with the first example sold to the Carron Company ironworks. 
> 
> Watt continued working to improve the engine, 
> and in 1781 introduced a system using a sun and planet gear 
> to turn the linear motion of the engines into rotary motion. 
> 
> This made it useful not only in the original pumping role, 
> but also as a direct replacement in roles where a water wheel would have been used previously. 
> This was a key moment in the industrial revolution, since power sources could now be located anywhere 
> instead of, as previously, needing a suitable water source and topography. 
> 
> Watt's partner Matthew Boulton began developing a multitude of machines 
> that made use of this rotary power, developing the first modern industrialized factory, the Soho Foundry, 
> which in turn produced new steam engine designs. 
> 
> Watt's early engines were like the original Newcomen designs in that they used low-pressure steam, 
> and all of the power was produced by atmospheric pressure. 
> 
> When, in the early 1800s, other companies introduced high-pressure steam engines, 
> Watt was reluctant to follow suit due to __safety concerns__. 
> Wanting to improve on the performance of his engines, 
> Watt began considering the use of higher-pressure steam, 
> as well as designs using multiple cylinders in both the double-acting concept 
> and the multiple-expansion concept. 
> 
> These double-acting engines required the invention of the parallel motion, 
> which allowed the piston rods of the individual cylinders to move in straight lines, 
> keeping the piston true in the cylinder, while the walking beam end moved through an arc, 
> somewhat analogous to a crosshead in later steam engines.
