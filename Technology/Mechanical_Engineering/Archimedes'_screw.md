> The Archimedes' screw, also known as the Archimedean screw, hydrodynamic screw, water screw 
> or Egyptian screw, is one of the earliest documented hydraulic machines. 
> 
> It was so-named after the Greek mathematician Archimedes who first described it around 234 BC, 
> although the device had been developed in Egypt earlier in the century. 
> It is a reversible hydraulic machine that can be operated both as a pump or a power generator. 
>
> As a machine used for lifting water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation ditches, 
> water is lifted by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a pipe. 
> 
> In the modern world, Archimedes screw pumps are widely used in wastewater treatment plants 
> and for dewatering low-lying regions. 
> 
> Run in reverse, Archimedes screw turbines act as a new form of small hydroelectric powerplant 
> that can be applied even in low head sites. 
> Such generators operate in a wide range of flows (0.01 m³/s to 14.5 m³/s) and heads (0.1 m to 10 m), 
> including low heads and moderate flow rates 
> that is not ideal for traditional turbines and not occupied by high performance technologies.
