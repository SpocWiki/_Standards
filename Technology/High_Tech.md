## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> High technology (high tech or high-tech), also known as advanced technology 
> (advanced tech) or exotechnology, is technology that is at the cutting edge: 
> the highest form of technology available. 
> 
> It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market. 
> The opposite of high tech is low technology, referring to simple, 
> often traditional or mechanical technology; 
> for example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device. 
> When high tech becomes old, it becomes low tech, for example vacuum tube electronics. 
> 
> Further, high tech is related to the concept of mid-tech, 
> that is a balance between the two opposite extreme qualities of low-tech and high tech. 
> Mid-tech could be understood as an inclusive middle 
> that combines the efficiency and versatility of digital/automated technology 
> with low-tech's potential for autonomy and resilience.
>
> Startups working on high technologies (or developing new high technologies) 
> are sometimes referred to as deep tech; 
> the term may also refer to disruptive innovations or those based on scientific discoveries.
>
> High tech, as opposed to high-touch, 
> may refer to self-service experiences that do not require human interaction.
