## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Brownout** is a drop in the magnitude of voltage in an electrical power system.
>
> Unintentional brownouts can be caused by excessive electricity demand, severe weather events, or a malfunction or error affecting electrical grid control or monitoring systems.  Intentional brownouts are used for load reduction in an emergency, or to prevent a total grid power outage due to high demand. The term brownout comes from the dimming of incandescent lighting when voltage reduces.
>
> In some countries, the term brownout refers not to a drop in voltage but to an intentional or unintentional power outage (or blackout).
