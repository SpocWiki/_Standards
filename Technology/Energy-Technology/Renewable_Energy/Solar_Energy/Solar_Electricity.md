> Solar power, also known as solar electricity, is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, 
> either directly using photovoltaics (PV) or indirectly using concentrated solar power. 
> 
> Solar panels use the photovoltaic effect to convert light into an electric current. 
> Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems 
> to focus a large area of sunlight to a hot spot, often to drive a steam turbine.
>
> Photovoltaics (PV) were initially solely used as a source of electricity 
> for small and medium-sized applications, from the calculator powered by a single solar cell 
> to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. 
> 
> Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. 
> Since then, as the cost of solar panels has fallen, grid-connected 
> solar PV systems' capacity and production has doubled about every three years. 
> Three-quarters of new generation capacity is solar, with both millions of rooftop installations 
> and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continuing to be built.
>
> In 2024, solar power generated 7% of global electricity 
> and over 1% of primary energy, adding twice as much new electricity as coal. 
>
> Along with onshore wind power, utility-scale solar is the source with 
> the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations in most countries. 
> China has about half the world’s solar power. 
> Almost half the solar power installed in 2022 was mounted on rooftops. 
>
> Much more low-carbon power is needed for electrification and to limit climate change. 
> The International Energy Agency said in 2022 that more effort was needed 
> for grid integration and the mitigation of policy, regulation and financing challenges. 
> 
> Nevertheless solar may greatly cut the cost of energy. Solar is important for energy security.
