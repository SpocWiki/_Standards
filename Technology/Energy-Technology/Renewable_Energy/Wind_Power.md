> Wind power is the use of wind energy to generate useful work. 
> Historically, wind power was used by sails, windmills and windpumps, 
> but today it is mostly used to generate electricity. 
> 
> This article deals only with wind power for electricity generation.
>
> Today, wind power is generated almost completely using wind turbines, 
> generally grouped into wind farms and connected to the electrical grid.
>
> In 2024, wind supplied about 2,500 TWh of electricity, 
> which was over 8% of world electricity. 
> 
> With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, 
> global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW. 
> 30 countries generated more than a tenth of their electricity 
> from wind power in 2024 and wind generation has nearly tripled since 2015. 
> 
> To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, 
> analysts say it should expand much faster – by over 1% of electricity generation per year.
>
> Wind power is a sustainable, renewable energy source, 
> and has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels. 
> Wind power is variable, so it needs energy storage 
> or other dispatchable generation energy sources 
> to attain a reliable supply of electricity. 
> 
> Land-based (onshore) wind farms have a greater visual impact on the landscape 
> than most other power stations per energy produced. 
> Wind farms sited offshore have less visual impact and have higher capacity factors, 
> although they are generally more expensive. 
> Offshore wind power currently has a share of about 10% of new installations.
>
> Wind power is one of the lowest-cost electricity sources per unit of energy produced. 
>
> In many locations, new onshore wind farms are cheaper than new coal or gas plants.
>
> Regions in the higher northern and southern latitudes 
> have the highest potential for wind power. 
> 
> **In most regions, wind power generation is higher in nighttime,** 
> **and in winter when solar power output is low**. 
> 
> So combinations of wind and solar power are suitable in many countries.
