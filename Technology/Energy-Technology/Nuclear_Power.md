## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Nuclear power** is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity. 
> Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. 
> Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power 
> is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. 
> 
> Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications 
> such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as Voyager 2. 
> Reactors producing controlled fusion power have been operated since 1958 
> but have yet to generate net power 
> and are not expected to be commercially available in the near future.
>
> The first nuclear power plant was built in the 1950s. 
> The global installed nuclear capacity grew to 100 GW in the late 1970s, 
> and then expanded during the 1980s, reaching 300 GW by 1990. 
> The 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States 
> and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union 
> resulted in increased regulation and public opposition to nuclear power plants. 
> 
> Nuclear power plants supplied 2,602 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2023, 
> equivalent to about 9% of global electricity generation, 
> and were the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity. 
> As of November 2024, there are 415 civilian fission reactors in the world, 
> with overall capacity of 374 GW, 66 under construction and 87 planned, 
> with a combined capacity of 72 GW and 84 GW, respectively. 
> 
> The United States has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, 
> generating almost 800 TWh of low-carbon electricity per year 
> with an average capacity factor of 92%. 
> The average global capacity factor is 89%. 
> Most new reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia.
>
> 
>
> Nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. 
> This is because nuclear power generation 
> causes one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated 
> compared to other energy sources. 
> 
> "Economists estimate that each nuclear plant built could save more than 800,000 life years." 
> Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity 
> have each caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and accidents. 
> Nuclear power plants also emit no greenhouse gases 
> and result in less life-cycle carbon emissions than common "renewables". 
> 
> The radiological hazards associated with nuclear power 
> are the primary motivations of the anti-nuclear movement, 
> which contends that nuclear power poses threats to people and the environment, 
> citing the potential for accidents like the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, 
> and is too expensive to deploy when compared to alternative sustainable energy sources.
