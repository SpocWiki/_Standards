> A nuclear reactor is a device used to sustain a controlled fission nuclear chain reaction. They are used for commercial electricity, marine propulsion, weapons production and research. Fissile nuclei (primarily uranium-235 or plutonium-239) absorb single neutrons and split, releasing energy and multiple neutrons, which can induce further fission. Reactors stabilize this, regulating neutron absorbers and moderators in the core. Fuel efficiency is exceptionally high; low-enriched uranium is 120,000 times more energy-dense than coal.

> Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid coolant. In commercial reactors, this drives turbines and electrical generator shafts. Some reactors are used for district heating, and isotope production for medical and industrial use.
>
> After the discovery of fission in 1938, many countries launched military nuclear research programs. Early subcritical experiments probed neutronics. In 1942, the first artificial critical nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1, was built by the Metallurgical Laboratory. From 1944, for weapons production, the first large-scale reactors were operated at the Hanford Site. The pressurized water reactor design, used in about 70% of commercial reactors, was developed for US Navy submarine propulsion, beginning with S1W in 1953. In 1954, nuclear electricity production began with the Soviet Obninsk plant.

> Spent fuel can be reprocessed, reducing nuclear waste and recovering reactor-usable fuel. This also poses a proliferation risk via production of plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. 
>
> Reactor accidents have been caused by combinations of design and operator failure. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident, at INES Level 5, and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and 2011 Fukushima disaster, both at Level 7, all had major effects on the nuclear industry and anti-nuclear movement.

> As of 2025, there are 417 commercial reactors, 226 research reactors, and over 200 marine propulsion reactors in operation globally. Commercial reactors provide 9% of the global electricity supply, compared to 30% from renewables, together comprising low-carbon electricity. Almost 90% of this comes from pressurized and boiling water reactors. Other designs include gas-cooled, fast-spectrum, breeder, heavy-water, molten-salt, and small modular; each optimizes safety, efficiency, cost, fuel type, enrichment, and burnup.
