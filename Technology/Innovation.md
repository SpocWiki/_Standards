> **Innovation** is the practical implementation of ideas 
> that result in the introduction of new goods or services 
> or improvement in offering goods or services. 
> 
> ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 defines innovation as 
> "a new or changed entity, realizing or redistributing value". 
> Others have different definitions; 
> a common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, 
> and spread of ideas or technologies.
>
> Innovation often takes place through the development of more-effective products, 
> processes, services, technologies, art works
> or business models that innovators make available to markets, governments and society.
>
> Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention: 
> innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention 
> (i.e. new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in a market or society, 
> and not all innovations require a new invention.
>
> Technical innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process 
> when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. 
> The opposite of innovation is exnovation.
