> **Color** (or colour in Commonwealth English) is the visual perception produced 
> by the activation of the different types of cone cells in the eye caused by light. 
> 
> Though color is not an inherent property of matter, 
> color perception is related to an object's light absorption, emission, reflection and transmission. 
> For most humans, visible wavelengths of light are the ones perceived in the visible light spectrum, 
> with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). 
> 
> Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types 
> or have eyes sensitive to different wavelengths, 
> such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus have a different color sensitivity range. 
> Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.
>
> Colors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness, and lightness. 
> Colors can also be additively mixed (mixing light) or subtractively mixed (mixing pigments). 
> If one color is mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, 
> they may look the same as another stimulus with a different reflection or emission spectrum. 
> 
> For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, 
> which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model 
> can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. 
> 
> As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, 
> photography, computer monitors, and television. 
> Some of the most well-known color models and color spaces are RGB, CMYK, HSL/HSV, CIE Lab, 
> and YCbCr/YUV.
>
> Because the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, 
> different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. 
> 
> Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. 
> In visual arts, color theory is used 
> to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. 
> The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; 
> and classification of primary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors. 
> The study of colors in general is called color science.
