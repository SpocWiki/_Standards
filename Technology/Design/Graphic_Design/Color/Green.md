> **Green** is the color between cyan and yellow on the visible spectrum. 
> It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. 
> In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, 
> it is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; 
> in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, 
> it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, 
> which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. 
> 
> By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, 
> the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. 
> Many creatures have adapted to their green environments 
> by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. 
> Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, 
> which is colored green by its chromium content.
>
> During post-classical and early modern Europe, 
> green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers, and the gentry, 
> while red was reserved for the nobility. 
> 
> For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci 
> and the benches in the British House of Commons are green 
> while those in the House of Lords are red. 
> 
> It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. 
> It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. 
> It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.
>
> In surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, 
> green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. 
> In the European Union and the United States, 
> green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health, 
> but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, 
> as the symbol of fertility and happiness. 
> 
> Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. 
> Political groups advocating environmental protection 
> and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, 
> some naming themselves Green parties. 
> This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, 
> as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. 
> 
> Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; 
> a green light means go ahead, 
> a green card permits permanent residence in the United States.
