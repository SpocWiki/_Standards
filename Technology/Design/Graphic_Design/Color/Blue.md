> **Blue** is one of the three primary colours in the RGB (additive) colour model, 
> as well as in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory). 
> It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. 
> 
> The term blue generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light 
> with a dominant wavelength that's between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 
> The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue 
> because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. 
> An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. 
> Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.
>
> Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. 
> The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament 
> and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. 
> 
> In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. 
> In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. 
> Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad 
> until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. 
> 
> In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments 
> gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. 
> Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms 
> and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. 
> 
> Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, 
> it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.
>
> In the United States and Europe, 
> blue is the colour that both men and women are most likely to choose as their favourite, 
> with at least one recent survey showing the same across several other countries, 
> including China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
> 
> Past surveys in the US and Europe have found 
> that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, confidence, masculinity, 
> knowledge, intelligence, calmness, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sadness.
