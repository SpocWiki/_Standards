> Primary colors are colorants or coloured lights 
> that can be mixed in varying amounts to produce a gamut of colors. 
> 
> This is the essential method used to create the perception of a broad range of colors in, e.g., 
> electronic displays, color printing, and paintings. 
> 
> Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors can be predicted 
> by an appropriate mixing model (e.g., additive, subtractive) 
> that uses the physics of how light interacts with physical media, 
> and ultimately the retina to be able to accurately display the intended colors. 
>
> The most common colour mixing models are 
> - the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) and 
> - the subtractive primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow). 
> 
> Red, yellow and blue are also commonly taught as primary colors 
> (usually in the context of subtractive color mixing as opposed to additive color mixing), 
> despite some criticism due to its lack of scientific basis.
>
> Primary colours can also be conceptual (not necessarily real), 
> either as additive mathematical elements of a color space 
> or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and philosophy. 
> 
> Color space primaries are precisely defined 
> and empirically rooted in psychophysical colorimetry experiments 
> which are foundational for understanding color vision. 
> 
> Primaries of some color spaces are complete (that is, all visible colors are described 
> in terms of their primaries weighted by nonnegative primary intensity coefficients) 
> but necessarily imaginary (that is, there is no plausible way 
> that those primary colors could be represented physically, or perceived). 
> 
> Phenomenological accounts of primary colors, such as the psychological primaries, 
> have been used as the conceptual basis for practical color applications 
> even though they are not a quantitative description in and of themselves.
>
> Sets of color space primaries are generally arbitrary, in the sense that 
> there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set. 
> Primary pigments or light sources are selected for a given application 
> on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost, stability, availability etc.
>
> The concept of primary colors has a long, complex history. 
> The choice of primary colors has changed over time in different domains that study color. 
> Descriptions of primary colors come from areas including philosophy, art history, 
> color order systems, and scientific work involving the physics of light and perception of color.
>
> Art education materials commonly use red, yellow, and blue as primary colors, 
> sometimes suggesting that they can mix all colors. 
> No set of real colorants or lights can mix all possible colors, however. 
> In other domains, the three primary colors are typically red, green and blue, 
> which are more closely aligned to the sensitivities of the photoreceptor pigments in the cone cells.
