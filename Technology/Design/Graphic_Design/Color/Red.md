> (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, 
> and is the complementary color of cyan.

> to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.
>
> Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. 
> The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; 
> Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. 
> It was also an important color in China, 
> where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. 
> 
> In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy
