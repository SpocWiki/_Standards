> On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, 
> it is located precisely midway between blue and red. 
> It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by most color printers, 
> along with yellow, cyan, and black to make all the other colors. 
> Magenta is a color made by mixing red and blue. 
> The tone of magenta used in printing, printer's magenta, 
> is redder than the magenta of the RGB (additive) model, the former being closer to rose.

This battle was decisive in liberating Italy from Austrian domination.
