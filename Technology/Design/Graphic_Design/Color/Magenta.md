> **Magenta** is a purple-red color. 
> On color wheels of the RGB (additive) and CMY (subtractive) color models, 
> it is located precisely midway between blue and red. 
> It is one of the four colors of ink used in color printing by most color printers, 
> along with yellow, cyan, and black to make all the other colors. 
> Magenta is a color made by mixing red and blue. 
> The tone of magenta used in printing, printer's magenta, 
> is redder than the magenta of the RGB (additive) model, the former being closer to rose.
>
> Magenta took its name from an aniline dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist FranÃ§ois-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it fuchsine. 
>
> It was renamed to celebrate the French-Sardinian victory under French Emperor Napoleon III at the Battle of Magenta against the larger army of the Austrian Empire on 4 June 1859 near the Italian town of Magenta, at the time in Austria. This battle was decisive in liberating Italy from Austrian domination. 
>
> A virtually identical color, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists, Edward Chambers Nicholson, and George Maule.
>
> The web color magenta is also called fuchsia.
