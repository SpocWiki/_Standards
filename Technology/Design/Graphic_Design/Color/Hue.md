> In color theory, **Hue** is one of the properties (called color appearance parameters) of a color, 
> defined in the CIECAM02 model as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet," within certain theories of color vision.
>
> Hue can typically be represented quantitatively by a single number, 
> often corresponding to an angular position around a central or neutral point or axis 
> on a color space coordinate diagram (such as a chromaticity diagram) or color wheel, 
> or by its dominant wavelength or by that of its complementary color. 
> 
> The other color appearance parameters are colorfulness, 
> saturation (also known as intensity or chroma), lightness, and brightness. 
> Usually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness - for example: "light blue", "pastel blue", "vivid blue", and "cobalt blue". Exceptions include brown, which is a dark orange.
>
> In painting, a hue is a pure pigment—one without tint or shade (added white or black pigment, respectively).
>
> The human brain first processes hues in areas in the extended  V4 called globs.
