> Magnetic tape is a medium for magnetic storage made of a thin, magnetizable coating 
> on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. 
> 
> It was developed in Germany in 1928, based on the earlier magnetic wire recording from Denmark. 
> Devices that use magnetic tape can with relative ease record and play back audio, visual, 
> and binary computer data. 
>
> Magnetic tape revolutionized sound recording and reproduction and broadcasting. 
> It allowed radio, which had always been broadcast live, to be recorded for later or repeated airing. 
> Since the early 1950s, magnetic tape has been used with computers 
> to store large quantities of data and is still used for backup purposes.
>
> Magnetic tape begins to degrade after 10â€“20 years 
> and therefore is not an ideal medium for long-term archival storage. 
> The exception is data tape formats like LTO which are specifically designed for long-term archiving.
>
> Information in magnetic tapes is often recorded in tracks 
> which are narrow and long areas of information recorded magnetically onto the tape, 
> which are separate from each other and often spaced apart from adjacent tracks. 
> 
> Tracks are often parallel to the length of the tape, in which case they are known as longitudinal tracks, 
> or diagonal relative to the length of the tape in helical scan (e.g. in Video-Recorders). 
> 
> There are also transverse scan and arcuate scanning, used in Quadruplex videotape. 
> Azimuth recording is used to reduce or eliminate the spacing that exists between adjacent tracks.
