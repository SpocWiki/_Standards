> In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), 
> is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is a core component of business intelligence. 
> 
> Data warehouses are central repositories of data integrated from disparate sources. 
> They store current and historical data organized in a way that is optimized for data analysis, 
> generation of reports, and developing insights across the integrated data. 
> They are intended to be used by analysts and managers to help make organizational decisions.
>
> The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from operational systems (such as marketing or sales). 
> The data may pass through an operational data store 
> and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality 
> before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting.
>
> The two main workflows for building a data warehouse system are 
> - extract, transform, load (ETL) and 
> - extract, load, transform (ELT), where the transform happens within the DW using e.g. DB Tools.
