> Data communication, including data transmission and data reception, is the transfer of data, 
> transmitted and received over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. 
> 
> Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, 
> wireless communication using radio spectrum, storage media and computer buses. 
> 
> The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, 
> radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.
>
> Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal that varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying waveforms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation is carried out by modem equipment.

> Digital communications, including digital transmission and digital reception, is the transfer of 
>
> either a digitized analog signal or a born-digital bitstream. According to the most common definition, both baseband and passband bit-stream components are considered part of a digital signal; an alternative definition considers only the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.
