> In cryptography, **Encryption** is the process of 
> transforming (more specifically, encoding) information in a way 
> that, ideally, only authorized parties can decode. 
> 
> This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, 
> into an alternative form known as ciphertext. 
> 
> Despite its goal, encryption is passive, i.e. it __does not itself prevent interference__ 
> but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.
>
> To prevent guessing, an encryption scheme 
> usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. 
> 
> It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, 
> for a well-designed encryption scheme, 
> considerable computational resources and skills are required. 
> 
> An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key 
> provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.
>
> Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. 
> 
> Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging. 
> 
> Since then, new techniques have emerged 
> and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing. 
> 
> Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of either public-key or symmetric-key. 
> 
> Modern encryption techniques ensure security,
