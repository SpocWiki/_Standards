| Feature         | Data Languages                        | Programming Languages                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Primary purpose | Representation & query of data        | Computation, logic, control flow              |
| Paradigm        | Declarative (mostly)                  | Imperative, functional, declarative, hybrid   |
| Execution       | Usually interpreted by a query engine | Compiled or interpreted by a runtime/compiler |
| Expressiveness  | Limited (focus on data & queries)     | High (supports general-purpose algorithms)    |
| Scope           | Domain-specific (data manipulation)   | General-purpose (problem solving)             |
| Examples        | SQL, SPARQL, XPath, JSON Schema       | Python, C#, Java, C++                         |
