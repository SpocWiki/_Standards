## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Software** consists of computer programs that instruct the execution of a computer. 
> Software also includes design documents and specifications.
>
> The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. 
> Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. 
> The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 
> allowed for more human-readable instructions, 
> making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures. 
> 
> Software in a programming language is run through a compiler or interpreter 
> to execute on the architecture's hardware. 
> Over time, software has become complex, 
> owing to developments in networking, operating systems, and databases.
>
> Software can generally be categorized into two main types:
> - operating systems, which manage hardware resources and provide services for applications 
> - application software, which performs specific tasks for users
>
> The rise of cloud computing has introduced the new software delivery model Software as a Service (SaaS). In SaaS, applications are hosted by a provider and accessed over the Internet.
>
> The process of developing software involves several stages. The stages include software design, programming, testing, release, and maintenance. 
> Software quality assurance and security are critical aspects of software development, 
> as bugs and security vulnerabilities can lead to system failures and security breaches. 
> Additionally, legal issues such as software licenses and intellectual property rights 
> play a significant role in the distribution of software products.
