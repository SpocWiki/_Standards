## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Internet Protocol (IP) is the network layer communications protocol 
> in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. 
> 
> Its **routing function** enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.
>
> IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host 
> solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. 
> 
> For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. 
> It also defines addressing methods that are 
> used to label the datagram with source and destination information.
>
> IP was the connectionless datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program 
> introduced by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974, 
> which was complemented by a connection-oriented service 
> that became the basis for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
> The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.
>
> The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), 
> is the dominant protocol of the Internet. 
> Its successor is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), 
> which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since around 2006.
