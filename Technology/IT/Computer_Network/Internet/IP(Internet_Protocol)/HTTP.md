## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol 
> in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
> 
> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, 
> where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
>
> Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 
> and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server 
> using the first HTTP version, named 0.9. 
> That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.
>
> Development of early HTTP Requests for Comments (RFCs) started a few years later 
> in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
> and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.
>
> HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.  It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999, 2014, and 2022. Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites. 
>
> HTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire". As of August 2024, it is supported by 66.2% of websites (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users). It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.
>
> HTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022. As of February 2024, it is now used on 30.9% of websites and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users. HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. Support for HTTP/3 was added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome first, and is also enabled in Firefox. HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).
