> The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
> is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. 
> 
> It originated in the initial network implementation 
> in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). 
> Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. 
> 
> TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) 
> between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. 
> 
> Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, file transfer and streaming media rely on TCP, which is part of the transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP. Today, TCP remains a core protocol for most Internet communication, ensuring reliable data transfer across diverse networks.
>
> TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver 
> firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; 
> they do this through a three-way handshake procedure. 
> 
> The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients 
> before a connection is established. 
> 
> Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, 
> and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. 
> 
> Applications that do not require reliable data stream service 
> may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, 
> which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. 
> 
> TCP employs network congestion avoidance. 
> However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, 
> connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.
