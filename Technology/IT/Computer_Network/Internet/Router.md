## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Router** is a computer and networking device 
> that forwards data packets between computer networks, 
> including internetworks such as the global Internet.
>
> Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet.  
> A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP networks. 
> 
> When a data packet comes in on a line, 
> the router reads the network address information in the packet header 
> to determine the ultimate destination. 
> 
> Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, 
> it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. 
> Data packets are forwarded from one router to another through an internetwork 
> until it reaches its destination node.
>
> The most familiar type of IP routers are home and small office routers 
> that forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet. 
> 
> More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, 
> connect large business or ISP networks to powerful core routers 
> that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone.
>
> Routers can be built from standard computer parts 
> but are mostly specialized purpose-built computers. 
> 
> Early routers used software-based forwarding, running on a CPU. 
> More sophisticated devices use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) 
> to increase performance or add advanced filtering and firewall functionality.
