## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An optical fiber, or optical fibre, is a flexible glass or plastic fiber 
> that can transmit light from one end to the other. 
> 
> Such fibers find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, 
> where they permit transmission over longer distances 
> and at higher bandwidths (data transfer rates) than electrical cables. 
> 
> Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss 
> and are immune to electromagnetic interference. 
> 
> Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging, 
> and are often wrapped in bundles so they may be used to carry light into, 
> or images out of confined spaces, as in the case of a fiberscope. 
> Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, 
> such as fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.
>
> Glass optical fibers are typically made by drawing, 
> while plastic fibers can be made either by drawing or by extrusion. 
> 
> Optical fibers typically include a core 
> surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction. 
> Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal reflection 
> which causes the fiber to act as a waveguide. 
> 
> Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode fibers, 
> while those that support a single mode are called single-mode fibers (SMF). 
> Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter 
> and are used for short-distance communication links 
> and for applications where high power must be transmitted. 
> 
> Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than 1,050 meters (3,440 ft).
>
> Being able to join optical fibers with low loss is important in fiber optic communication. 
> This is more complex than joining electrical wire or cable 
> and involves careful cleaving of the fibers, precise alignment of the fiber cores, 
> and the coupling of these aligned cores. 
> 
> For applications that demand a permanent connection a fusion splice is common. 
> In this technique, an electric arc is used to melt the ends of the fibers together. 
> Another common technique is a mechanical splice, 
> where the ends of the fibers are held in contact by mechanical force. 
> 
> Temporary or semi-permanent connections are made 
> by means of specialized optical fiber connectors. 
> 
> The field of applied science and engineering 
> concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics. 
> The term was coined by Indian-American physicist Narinder Singh Kapany.
