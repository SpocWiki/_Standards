> A **Submarine communications cable** is a cable laid on the seabed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean and sea. The first submarine communications cables were laid beginning in the 1850s and carried telegraphy traffic, establishing the first instant telecommunications links between continents, such as the first transatlantic telegraph cable which became operational on 16 August 1858.
>
> Submarine cables first connected all the world's continents (except Antarctica) when Java was connected to Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, in 1871 in anticipation of the completion of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line in 1872 connecting to Adelaide, South Australia and thence to the rest of Australia.
>
> Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data communications traffic. These early cables used copper wires in their cores, but modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry digital data, which includes telephone, internet and private data traffic. Modern cables are typically about 25 mm (1 in) in diameter and weigh around 1.4 tonnes per kilometre (2.5 short tons per mile; 2.2 long tons per mile) for the deep-sea sections which comprise the majority of the run, although larger and heavier cables are used for shallow-water sections near shore.

## Redundancy 

Fibers are extremely sensitive, because it is less than 3-dimensional which would make it robust. 
Additionally, burying it in the ground would make it more robust too. 

It regularly happens that ships' anchors damage such cables due to drift, but also Sabotage is real. 

In addition to the Fibers, Signals have to be refreshed every 80km. 
Repeaters are inserted and power-supplied by the cable itself. 
Repeaters cost half a million $ each. 
So Transatlantic Cables can be built only by international Consortiums. 

When a Cable is damaged, it needs to be retrieved and repaired on board of a ship. 

There are ca. 12k Data_Centers world-wide, half of them in the US, more than 40 around Frankfurt. 
Each costs ca. 300e6$
