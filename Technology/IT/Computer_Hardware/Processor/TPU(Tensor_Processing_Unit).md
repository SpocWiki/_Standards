> Tensor Processing Unit (**TPU**) is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google for neural network machine learning, using Google's own TensorFlow software. 
> 
> Google began using TPUs internally in 2015, and in 2018 made them available for third-party use, 
> both as part of its cloud infrastructure and by offering a smaller version of the chip for sale.
