GPUs like Nvidias RTX A500 can run Neural Loads, but at a much higher Power Consumption, 
also because they use 4Byte Float Numbers, unlike NPUs which use 1Byte signed. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A graphics processing unit (**GPU**) is a specialized electronic circuit 
> initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing (either on a video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles). After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.
