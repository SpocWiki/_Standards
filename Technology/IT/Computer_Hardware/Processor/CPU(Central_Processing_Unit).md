## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A central processing unit (**CPU**), also called a central processor, main processor, or just processor, 
> is the primary processor in a given computer. 
> 
> Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, 
> such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. 
> 
> This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and I/O circuitry, 
> and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
>
> The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, 
> but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. 
> 
> Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic–logic unit (ALU) 
> that performs arithmetic and logic operations, 
> processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, 
> and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), 
> decoding and execution (of instructions) 
> by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers, and other components. 
> 
> Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor area to caches and instruction-level parallelism 
> to increase performance and to CPU modes to support operating systems and virtualization.
>
> Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, 
> with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. 
> 
> Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are called multi-core processors. 
> 
> The individual physical CPUs, called processor cores, 
> can also be multithreaded to support CPU-level multithreading.
>
> An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, 
> and other components of a computer; 
> such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).
