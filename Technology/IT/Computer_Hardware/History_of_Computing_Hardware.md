> The history of computing hardware spans the developments 
> from early devices used for simple calculations to today's complex computers, 
> encompassing advancements in both analog and digital technology.
>
> The first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices 
> which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, 
> then manipulate the device to obtain the result. 
> 
> In later stages, computing devices began representing numbers in continuous forms, 
> such as by distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a specific voltage level. 
> 
> Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanism. 
> Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, 
> it greatly increased the precision of results. 
> 
> The development of transistor technology, followed by the invention of integrated circuit chips, 
> led to revolutionary breakthroughs. 
>
> Transistor-based computers and, later, integrated circuit-based computers 
> enabled digital systems to gradually replace analog systems, 
> increasing both efficiency and processing power. 
> 
> Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) then 
> enabled semiconductor memory and the microprocessor, leading to another key breakthrough, 
> the miniaturized personal computer (PC), in the 1970s. 
> 
> The cost of computers gradually became so low that personal computers by the 1990s, 
> and then mobile computers (smartphones and tablets) in the 2000s, became ubiquitous.
