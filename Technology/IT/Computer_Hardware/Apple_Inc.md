> including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, 
> launching the "Think different" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, 
> opening the Apple Store retail chain, 
> and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio.

> Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. 
> He was succeeded as CEO by [[Cook,Tim]].

> Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, 
> its environmental practices, and its business ethics, 
> including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. 
> 
> Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. 
> It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.
>
> Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued
