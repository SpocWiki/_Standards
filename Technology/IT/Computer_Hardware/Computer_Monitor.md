> A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form. 
> A discrete monitor comprises a visual display, support electronics, 
> power supply, housing, electrical connectors, and external user controls.
>
> The display in modern monitors is typically an LCD with LED backlight, 
> having by the 2010s replaced CCFL backlit LCDs. 
> Before the mid-2000s, most monitors used a cathode-ray tube (CRT) as the image output technology. 
> A monitor is typically connected to its host computer via DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C, DVI, or VGA. 
> Monitors sometimes use other proprietary connectors and signals to connect to a computer, which is less common.
>
> Originally computer monitors were used for data processing while television sets were used for video. 
> From the 1980s onward, computers (and their monitors) have been used 
> for both data processing and video, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. 
> Since 2010, the typical display aspect ratio of 
> both televisions and computer monitors changed from 4:3 to 16:9
>
> Modern computer monitors are often functionally interchangeable with television sets and vice versa. 
> As most computer monitors do not include integrated speakers, TV tuners, or remote controls, 
> external components such as a DTA box may be needed to use a computer monitor as a TV set.
