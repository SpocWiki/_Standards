> Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits, and Apple Music Country, 
> which are broadcast live to over 200 countries 24 hours a day. 
> 
> The service was announced on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, 2015.

> with the purchase of select products before the service requires a monthly subscription.
>
> Originally strictly a music service, Apple Music began expanding into video in 2016.

> both in terms of music videos and concert footage that support music releases, 
> as well as web series and feature films.
>
> The original iOS version of Apple Music received mixed reviews, 
> with criticism directed towards a user interface deemed "not intuitive". 
> 
> However, it was praised for its playlist curation, a vast library of songs to stream, 
> and its integration with other Apple devices and services. 
> 
> In iOS 10, the app received a significant redesign, 
> which received positive reviews for an updated interface with less clutter, 
> improved navigation, and a bigger emphasis on users' libraries. 
> 
> Apple Music gained popularity rapidly after its launch, 
> passing the milestone of 10 million subscribers in only six months. 
> 
> Though Apple does not disclose the amount of paid subscribers, 
> research firm Midia Research estimated it at 78 million as of November 2021. 
> Apple Music reached the 100 million songs milestone in its streaming catalog in October 2022.

> is "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran with more than 930 million plays worldwide.
>
> On November 8, 2023, it was revealed that Taylor Swift is the most streamed female artist in the platform's history 
> as well as the female artist with most songs reaching Global Daily Top 100. 
> It was also revealed that Midnights stands as the biggest album of all time by a female artist 
> in the platform's history by first-day and first-week streams worldwide. 
>
> On November 28, 2023, it was announced that in 2023,

### Royalty payment policy

Shortly before Apple Music was released, singer-songwriter [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift "Taylor Swift") wrote an open letter 
publicly criticizing Apple's decision to not reimburse artists during a user's free trial period 
and announced that she would be holding back her album _[1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album) "1989 (Taylor Swift album)")_ from the service. 

She said the policy was "unfair" as "Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those months".
UK independent record label [Beggars Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars_Group "Beggars Group") also criticized the trial period, saying it struggled "to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple's customer acquisition costs". 

The day after Swift's letter, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services [Eddy Cue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue "Eddy Cue") 
announced on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") that Apple had changed its policy, and 
that Apple Music "will pay artists for streaming, even during customers' free trial period".  
On Twitter, Swift wrote "After the events of this week, I've decided to put _1989_ on Apple Music... And happily so". 
She concluded saying it was "the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album".
