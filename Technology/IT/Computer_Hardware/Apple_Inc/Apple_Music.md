### Royalty payment policy

Shortly before Apple Music was released, singer-songwriter [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift "Taylor Swift") wrote an open letter 
publicly criticizing Apple's decision to not reimburse artists during a user's free trial period 
and announced that she would be holding back her album _[1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album) "1989 (Taylor Swift album)")_ from the service. 

She said the policy was "unfair" as "Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those months".
UK independent record label [Beggars Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars_Group "Beggars Group") also criticized the trial period, saying it struggled "to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple's customer acquisition costs". 

The day after Swift's letter, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services [Eddy Cue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue "Eddy Cue") 
announced on [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") that Apple had changed its policy, and 
that Apple Music "will pay artists for streaming, even during customers' free trial period".  
On Twitter, Swift wrote "After the events of this week, I've decided to put _1989_ on Apple Music... And happily so". 
She concluded saying it was "the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album".
