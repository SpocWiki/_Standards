> A **Peripheral**  device, or simply peripheral, is an auxiliary hardware device 
> that a computer uses to transfer information externally. 
> 
> A peripheral is a hardware component that is accessible to and controlled by a computer 
> but is not a core component of the computer. 
> 
> It can communicate with a computer through wired or wireless connections. 
> 
> Many modern electronic devices, such as Internet-enabled digital watches, 
> video game consoles, smartphones, and tablet computers, have interfaces for use as a peripheral.
>
> Mouses and keyboards became the standard for computer peripheral input devices in the 1970s, 
> while memory storage devices continued to be developed in new ways. 
> 
> Output devices, such as monitors, began as cathode rays, 
> before switching to LCD monitors in the 1980s.
