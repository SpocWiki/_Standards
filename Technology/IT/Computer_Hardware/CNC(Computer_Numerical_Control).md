> Computer numerical control (CNC) or CNC machining 
> is the automated control of machine tools by a computer. 
> 
> It is an evolution of numerical control (NC),  
> where machine tools are directly managed by data storage media such as punched cards or punched tape. A very early example of this is the [[Jacquard_Machine]]. 
> 
> 
> Because CNC allows for easier programming, modification, and real-time adjustments, 
> it has gradually replaced NC as computing costs declined.
>
> A CNC machine is a motorized maneuverable tool and often a motorized maneuverable platform, 
> which are both controlled by a computer, according to specific input instructions. 
> Instructions are delivered to a CNC machine in the form of 
> a sequential program of machine control instructions such as G-code and M-code, and then executed. 
> 
> The program can be written by a person or, far more often, 
> generated by graphical computer-aided design (CAD) 
> or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. 
> In the case of 3D printers, the part to be printed is "sliced" 
> before the instructions (or the program) are generated. 3D printers also use G-Code.
>
> CNC offers greatly increased productivity over non-computerized machining for repetitive production, 
> where the machine must be manually controlled (e.g. using devices such as hand wheels or levers) 
> or mechanically controlled by pre-fabricated pattern guides (see pantograph mill). 
> 
> However, these advantages come at significant 
> cost in terms of both capital expenditure and job setup time. 
> For some prototyping and small batch jobs, 
> a good machine operator can have parts finished to a high standard 
> whilst a CNC workflow is still in setup.
>
> In modern CNC systems, the design of a mechanical part 
> and its manufacturing program are highly automated. 
> 
> The part's mechanical dimensions are defined using CAD software 
> and then translated into manufacturing directives by CAM software. 
> The resulting directives are transformed (by "post processor" software) 
> into the specific commands necessary for a particular machine to produce the component 
> and then are loaded into the CNC machine.
>
> Since any particular component might require the use of 
> several different tools – drills, saws,  touch probes etc. – 
> modern machines often combine multiple tools into a single "cell". 
> 
> In other installations, several different machines are used with an external controller 
> and human or robotic operators that move the component from machine to machine. 
> 
> In either case, the series of steps needed to produce any part is highly automated 
> and produces a part that meets every specification in the original CAD drawing, 
> where each specification includes a tolerance.
