> Dynamic random-access memory (dynamic RAM or DRAM) 
> is a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell, 
> usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, 
> both typically based on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology. 
> 
> While most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors. 
> In the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged; 
> these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1.  
> 
> The electric charge on the capacitors gradually leaks away; 
> without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost.  
> 
> To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit 
> which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. 
> This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, 
> in contrast to static random-access memory (SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. 
> 
> Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory),

> The need to refresh DRAM demands more complicated circuitry and timing than SRAM. This complexity is offset by the structural simplicity of DRAM memory cells: only one transistor and a capacitor are required per bit, compared to four or six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very high densities with a simultaneous reduction in cost per bit. Refreshing the data consumes power, causing a variety of techniques to be used to manage the overall power consumption. For this reason, DRAM usually needs to operate with a memory controller; the memory controller needs to know DRAM parameters, especially memory timings, to initialize DRAMs, which may be different depending on different DRAM manufacturers and part numbers.

> DRAM had a 47% increase in the price-per-bit in 2017, the largest jump in 30 years since the 45% jump in 1988, while in recent years the price has been going down. In 2018, a "key characteristic of the DRAM market is that there are currently only three major suppliers — Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics" that are "keeping a pretty tight rein on their capacity". There is also Kioxia (previously Toshiba Memory Corporation after 2017 spin-off) which doesn't manufacture DRAM. Other manufacturers make and sell DIMMs (but not the DRAM chips in them), such as Kingston Technology, and some manufacturers that sell stacked DRAM (used e.g. in the fastest supercomputers on the exascale), separately such as Viking Technology. Others sell such integrated into other products, such as Fujitsu into its CPUs, AMD in GPUs, and Nvidia, with HBM2 in some of their GPU chips.
