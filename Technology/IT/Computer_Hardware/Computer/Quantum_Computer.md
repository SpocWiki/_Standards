> A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer 
> that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: 
> it exploits superposed and entangled states, 
> and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, 
> as features of its computation. 
> 
> Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems 
> that evolve in ways that may be described as 
> operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, 
> though still subject to strict computational constraints. 
> 
> By contrast, ordinary ("classical") computers operate according to deterministic rules. 
> (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, 
> with only a simple multiple of time cost. 
> On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require 
> exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) 
> 
> It is widely believed that a quantum computer 
> could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer.

> For example, a large-scale quantum computer

> Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.
