> **Apple II** ("apple two", stylized as `Apple ][`) is a series of microcomputers 
> manufactured by [[../Apple_Inc|Apple Computer, Inc]]. from 1977 to 1993. 
> The original Apple II model, which gave the series its name, 
> was designed by [[Wozniak,Steve]] and was first sold on June 10, 1977. 
> 
> Its success led to it being followed by the Apple II Plus, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, and Apple IIc Plus, 
> with the 1983 IIe being the most popular. 
> The name is trademarked with square brackets as `Apple ][`, then, beginning with the IIe, as Apple //.
>
> The Apple II was a major advancement over its predecessor, 
> the Apple I, in terms of ease of use, features, and expandability. 
> 
> It became one of several recognizable and successful computers throughout the 1980s, 
> although this was mainly limited to the US. 
> It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts 
> and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions, 
> which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools, 
> displacing the early leader Commodore PET. 
> The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, 
> including the 1979 release of the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet, 
> made the computer especially popular with business users and families.
>
> The Apple II computers are based on the 6502 8-bit processor 
> and can display text and two resolutions of color graphics. 
> A software-controlled speaker provides one channel of low-fidelity audio. 
> A model with more advanced graphics and sound 
> and a 16-bit processor, the Apple IIGS, was added in 1986. 
> It remained compatible with earlier Apple II models, 
> but the IIGS has more in common with mid-1980s systems 
> like the Atari ST, Amiga, and Acorn Archimedes.
>
> Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based Macintosh in 1984, 
> the Apple II series still reportedly accounted for 85% of the company's hardware sales in the first quarter of fiscal 1985. 
> Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh 
> until terminating the IIGS in December 1992 and the IIe in November 1993. 
> The last II-series Apple in production, the IIe card for Macintoshes, 
> was discontinued on October 15, 1993; 
> having been one of the longest running mass-produced home computer series, 
> the total Apple II sales of all of its models during its 16-year production run 
> were about 6 million units (including about 1.25 million Apple IIGS models) 
> with the peak occurring in 1983 when 1 million were sold.
