> The Commodore 64, also known as the **C64**, is an 8-bit home computer 
> introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International 
> (first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show, January 7–10, 1982, in Las Vegas). 
> 
> It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as 
> the highest-selling single computer model of all time, 
> with independent estimates placing the number sold between 12.5 and 17 million units. 
> 
> Volume production started in early 1982, 
> marketing in August for US$595 (equivalent to $1,940 in 2024). 
> Preceded by the VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes of RAM. 
> With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, 
> the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware.
>
> The C64 dominated the low-end computer market (except in the UK, France and Japan, 
> lasting only about six months in Japan) for most of the later years of the 1980s. 
> For a substantial period (1983–1986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market 
> and two million units sold per year, outselling IBM PC compatibles, the Apple II, 
> and Atari 8-bit computers. 
> 
> Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, 
> "When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years." 
> In the UK market, the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro, the ZX Spectrum, 
> and later the Amstrad CPC 464, 
> but the C64 was still the second-most-popular computer in the UK after the ZX Spectrum. 
> The Commodore 64 failed to make any impact in Japan, 
> as their market was dominated by Japanese computers, 
> such as the NEC PC-8801, Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7 and MSX, 
> and in France, where the ZX Spectrum, Thomson MO5 and TO7, and Amstrad CPC 464 dominated the market.
>
> Part of the Commodore 64's success was its sale in regular retail stores 
> instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. 
> 
> Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, 
> including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. 
> 
> In the United States, it has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in 
> bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production. 
> 
> Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore 64, 
> including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games. 
> 
> C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, 
> or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. 
> 
> The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demoscene 
> and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. 
> In 2011, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that 
> brand recognition for the model was still at 87%.
