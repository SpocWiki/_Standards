> Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) 
> was an American businessman, inventor, and investor 
> best known for co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. 
> 
> Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. 
> He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, 
> along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
>
> Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. 
> He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. 
> In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. 
> He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 
> to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. 
> Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, 
> one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. 
>
> Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, 
> which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). 
> This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, 
> followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. 
> The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) 
> with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, 
> the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.
>
> In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long 
> power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. 
> That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, 
> a computer platform development company 
> that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. 
> In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, 
> which was spun off independently as Pixar. 
> Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), 
> and became a leading animation studio, 
> producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.
>
> In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. 
> He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. 
> He worked closely with British designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products and services 
> that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign, 
> and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. 
> 
> Jobs was also a board member at [[Gap_Inc]]. from 1999 to 2002. 
> In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. 
> He died of tumor-related respiratory arrest in 2011; 
> in 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
> Since his death, he has won 141 patents; Jobs holds over 450 patents in total.
