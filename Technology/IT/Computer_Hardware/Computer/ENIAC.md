## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical  Integrator and Computer) 
> was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945. 
> Other computers had some of these features, but ENIAC was the first to have them all. 
> It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
>
> ENIAC was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert 
> to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory 
> (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory). 
> However, its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.
>
> ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.
>
> ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946, 
> having cost $487,000 (equivalent to $6,900,000 in 2023), and called a "Giant Brain" by the press. 
> It had a speed on the order of one **thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines**.
>
> ENIAC was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. 
> It was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland in 1947, 
> where it was in continuous operation until 1955.
