> The **Jacquard machine** (French: [ʒakaʁ]) is a device fitted to a loom 
> that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles 
> with complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelassé. 
> The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. 
> 
> The machine was patented by [[Jacquard,Joseph_Marie]] in 1804, 
> based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), 
> and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). 
> 
> The machine was controlled by a "chain of cards"; 
> a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. 
> Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, 
> with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. 
>
> Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. 
> This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations, 
> as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of 
> unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. 
> 
> The term "Jacquard" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, 
> but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. 
> The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles such as jerseys.
>
> This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations 
> is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, 
> having inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and the Punch Cards used by [[Hollerith,Herman]].
