## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Touchscreen** is a type of display that can detect touch input from a user. 
> 
> It consists of both an input device (a touch panel) and an output device (a visual display). 
> The touch panel is typically layered on the top of the electronic visual display of a device. 
> Touchscreens are commonly found in smartphones, tablets, laptops, 
> and other electronic devices. 
> 
> The display is often an LCD, AMOLED or OLED display.
>
> A user can give input or control the information processing system 
> through simple or multi-touch gestures 
> by touching the screen with a special stylus or one or more fingers. 
> 
> Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work, 
> while others may only work using a special stylus or pen. 
> The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and, if the software allows, 
> to control how it is displayed; for example, zooming to increase the text size.
>
> A touchscreen allows users to interact directly with on-screen content, 
> rather than using indirect input devices such as a mouse or touchpad. 
> Touchscreens are commonly found on smartphones, tablets, kiosks, 
> and many modern laptops, 
> where they allow tapping, swiping, and pinching to perform actions on the screen.
>
> Touchscreens are common in devices such as smartphones, 
> handheld game consoles, and personal computers. 
> They are common in point-of-sale (POS) systems, automated teller machines (ATMs), 
> electronic voting machines, and automobile infotainment systems and controls. 
> 
> They can also be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. 
> They play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances 
> such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some e-readers. 
> Touchscreens are important in educational settings such as 
> classrooms or on college campuses.
>
> The popularity of smartphones, tablets, and many types of information appliances 
> has driven the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics. 
> 
> Touchscreens are found in the medical field, heavy industry, automated teller machines 
> (ATMs), and kiosks such as museum displays or room automation, 
> where keyboard and mouse systems do not allow a suitably intuitive, rapid, 
> or accurate interaction by the user with the display's content.
>
> Historically, the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware 
> have been made available by a wide array of after-market system integrators, 
> and not by display, chip, or motherboard manufacturers. 
> 
> Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers have acknowledged the 
> trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a user interface component 
> and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products.
