## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Computer security (also cybersecurity, digital security, or information technology (IT) security) 
> is a subdiscipline within the field of information security. 
> 
> It focuses on protecting computer software, systems and networks 
> from threats that can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, theft 
> or damage to hardware, software, or data, 
> as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
>
> The growing significance of computer insecurity reflects the increasing **dependence on computer systems**, 
> the Internet, and evolving wireless network standards. 
> This reliance has expanded with the proliferation of smart devices, 
> including smartphones, televisions, and other components of the Internet of things (IoT).
>
> As digital infrastructure becomes more embedded in everyday life, 
> cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern. 
> 
> The complexity of modern information systems—and the societal functions they underpin—
> has introduced new vulnerabilities. 
> Systems that manage essential services, such as power grids, electoral processes, and finance, 
> are particularly sensitive to security breaches.
>
> Although many aspects of computer security involve digital security, 
> such as electronic passwords and encryption, 
> physical security measures such as metal locks are still used to prevent unauthorized tampering. 
> 
> IT security is not a perfect subset of information security, 
> therefore does not  completely align into the security convergence schema.
