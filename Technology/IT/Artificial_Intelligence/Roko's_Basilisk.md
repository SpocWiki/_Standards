> **Roko's Basilisk** is a thought experiment which states that 
> an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence (AI) in the future 
> would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation 
> to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence 
> but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development, 
> in order to incentivize said advancement. 
> 
> It originated in a 2010 post at discussion board [[LessWrong]], 
> a technical forum focused on analytical rational enquiry. 
> 
> The thought experiment's name derives from the poster of the article (Roko) 
> and the basilisk, a mythical creature capable of destroying enemies with its stare.
>
> While the theory was initially dismissed as nothing but conjecture 
> or speculation by many LessWrong users, 
> LessWrong co-founder [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] reported 
> users who panicked upon reading the theory, 
> due to its stipulation that knowing about the theory and its basilisk 
> made one vulnerable to the basilisk itself. 
> 
> This led to discussion of the basilisk on the site being banned for five years. 
> However, these reports were later dismissed as being exaggerations or inconsequential, 
> and the theory itself was dismissed as nonsense, including by Yudkowsky himself. 
> Even after the post's discreditation, 
> it is still used as an example of principles such as Bayesian probability and implicit religion. 
> It is also regarded as a simplified, derivative version of [[Pascal's wager]].
