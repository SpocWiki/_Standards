> In artificial intelligence (AI), 
> an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert.
>
> Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, 
> represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural programming code.  
> Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of AI software. 
> 
> They were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s, 
> being then widely regarded as the future of AI — before the advent of successful artificial neural networks.
>
> An expert system is divided into two subsystems: 
> 1) a knowledge base, which represents facts and rules; and 
> 2) an inference engine, which applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts, and can include explaining and debugging abilities.
