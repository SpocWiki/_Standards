> **Computing** is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computing machinery. 
> It includes the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes, 
> and the development of both hardware and software. 
> 
> Computing has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and social aspects. 
> Major computing disciplines include computer engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, 
> data science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering.
>
> The term computing is also synonymous with counting and calculating. 
> In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by mechanical computing machines, 
> and before that, to human computers.
