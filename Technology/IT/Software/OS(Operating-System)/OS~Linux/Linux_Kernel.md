> The Linux kernel is a free and open-source Unix-like kernel that is used in many computer systems worldwide. 
> The kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 
> and was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system (OS) 
> which was created to be a free replacement for Unix. 
> 
> Since the late 1990s, it has been included in many operating system distributions, many of which are called Linux. 
> One such Linux kernel operating system is Android which is used in many mobile and embedded devices.
>
> Most of the kernel code is written in C as supported by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 
> which has extensions beyond standard C. 
> 
> The code also contains assembly code for architecture-specific logic 
> such as optimizing memory use and task execution. 
> 
> The kernel has a modular design such that modules can be integrated as software components – 
> including dynamically loaded. 
> The kernel is monolithic in an architectural sense since the entire OS kernel runs in kernel space.
>
> Linux is provided under the GNU General Public License version 2, 
> although it contains files under other compatible licenses.
