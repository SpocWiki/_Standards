> Mac operating systems were developed by Apple Inc. in a succession of two major series.
>
> In 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the classic Mac OS 
> with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. 
> 
> The system, rebranded Mac OS in 1997, was pre-installed on every Macintosh until 2002 
> and offered on Macintosh clones shortly in the 1990s. 
> It was noted for its ease of use, 
> and also **criticized for its lack of modern technologies** compared to its competitors.
>
> The current Mac operating system is macOS, 
> originally named Mac OS X until 2012 and then OS X until 2016. 
> 
> It was developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT. 
> It brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, 
> that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced, 
> such as problems with memory management. 
> 
> The current macOS is pre-installed with every Mac and receives a major update annually. 
> It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices â€“ 
> iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
>
> Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X, Apple experimented with several other concepts, 
> releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications 
> to Unix-like systems or vice versa, A/UX, MAE, and MkLinux. 
> Apple's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS 
> in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects, code named Star Trek, Taligent, and Copland.
>
> Although the classic Mac OS and macOS (Mac OS X) have different architectures, 
> they share a common set of GUI principles, including 
> - a menu bar across the top of the screen; 
> - the Finder shell, featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications 
>   using icons 
> - and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders 
> - and a trash can; 
> - and overlapping windows for multitasking.
>
> Before the arrival of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple's history of operating systems 
> began with its Apple II computers in 1977, which run Apple DOS, ProDOS, and GS/OS; 
> the Apple III in 1980 runs Apple SOS; 
> and the Lisa in 1983 which runs Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL, a Macintosh emulator. 
> Apple developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from 1993 to 1997.
>
> Apple launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS: 
> - iOS in 2007 for its iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch mobile devices, 
>   and in 2017 for its HomePod smart speakers; 
> - watchOS in 2015 for the Apple Watch; 
> - tvOS in 2015 for the Apple TV set-top box; and 
> - visionOS in 2024 for the Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset.
