> **vnc** (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop-sharing system 
> that uses the [[RFB(Remote_Frame_Buffer)]] protocol to remotely control another computer. 
> It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, 
> relaying the graphical-screen updates, over a network. 
> Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support 
> and accessing files on one's work computer from one's home computer, or vice versa.
>
> VNC is platform-independent, with clients and servers for many GUI-based operating systems and for Java. 
> Multiple clients may connect to a VNC server at the same time. 
> There are a number of variants of VNC which offer their own particular functionality; 
> e.g., some optimized for Microsoft Windows, or offering file transfer (not part of VNC proper), etc. 
> 
> Many are compatible (without their added features) with VNC proper in the sense that 
> a viewer of one flavor can connect with a server of another; 
> others are based on VNC code but not compatible with standard VNC.
>
> VNC was originally developed at the Olivetti & Oracle Research Lab in Cambridge, United Kingdom, 
> whose developers subsequently created RealVNC Ltd 
> and claimed VNC and RFB as registered trademarks in the US and some other countries. 
> 
> The original VNC source code and many modern derivatives 
> are open source under the GNU General Public License.
