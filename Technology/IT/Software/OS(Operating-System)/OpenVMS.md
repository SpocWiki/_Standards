> **OpenVMS**, often referred to as just VMS, 
> is a multi-user, multiprocessing and virtual memory-based operating system. 
> 
> It is designed to support time-sharing, batch processing, transaction processing 
> and workstation applications. 
> 
> Customers using OpenVMS include banks and financial services, hospitals and healthcare, telecommunications operators, network information services, and industrial manufacturers. 
> 
> During the 1990s and 2000s, there were approximately half a million VMS systems in operation worldwide.
>
> It was first announced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) as VAX/VMS 
> (Virtual Address eXtension/Virtual Memory System) 
> alongside the VAX-11/780 minicomputer in 1977. 
> 
> OpenVMS has subsequently been ported to run on DEC Alpha systems, 
> the Itanium-based HPE Integrity Servers, and select x86-64 hardware and hypervisors. 
> 
> Since 2014, OpenVMS is developed and supported by VMS Software Inc. (VSI). 
> OpenVMS offers high availability through clusteringâ€”
> the ability to distribute the system over multiple physical machines. 
> 
> This allows clustered applications and data to remain continuously available 
> while operating system software and hardware maintenance and upgrades are performed, 
> or if part of the cluster is destroyed. 
> 
> VMS cluster uptimes of 17 years have been reported.
