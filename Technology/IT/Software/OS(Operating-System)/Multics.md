> **Multics** ("MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service") 
> is an influential early time-sharing operating system 
> based on the concept of a single-level memory. 
> 
> Nathan Gregory writes that 
> Multics "has influenced all modern operating systems since, 
> from microcomputers to mainframes."
>
> Initial planning and development for Multics started in 1964, 
> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
> 
> Originally it was a cooperative project led by MIT (Project MAC with Fernando CorbatÃ³) along with General Electric and Bell Labs. 
> 
> It was developed on the [[GE_645]] computer, which was specially designed for it; 
> the first one was delivered to MIT in January 1967. 
> 
> GE offered their earlier 635 systems with an early timesharing system 
> known as "[[Mark_I]]" and intended to offer the 645 with Multics as a larger successor. 
> 
> Bell withdrew from the project in 1969 
> as it became clear it would not deliver a working system in the short term. 
> 
> Shortly thereafter, GE decided to exit the computer industry entirely 
> and sold the division to Honeywell in 1970. 
> Honeywell offered Multics commercially, but with limited success.
>
> Multics has numerous features intended to ensure high availability 
> so that it would support a computing utility 
> similar to the telephone and electricity utilities. 
> 
> Modular hardware structure and software architecture are used to achieve this. 
> The system can grow in size by simply adding more of the appropriate resource, 
> be it computing power, main memory, or disk storage. 
> 
> Separate access control lists on every file provide flexible information sharing, 
> but complete privacy when needed. 
> 
> Multics has a number of standard mechanisms 
> to allow engineers to analyze the performance of the system, 
> as well as a number of adaptive performance optimization mechanisms.
>
> Due to its many novel and valuable ideas, 
> Multics has had a significant influence on computer science despite its faults. 
> 
> Its most lasting effect on the computer industry was to  inspire the creation of Unix, 
> which carried forward many Multics features, 
> but was able to run on less-expensive hardware. 
> 
> [[OS~Unix]] was developed at Bell to allow their Multics team to continue their research 
> using smaller machines, first a [[PDP-7]] and ultimately the [[PDP-11]].
