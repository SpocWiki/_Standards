## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Cooperative multitasking, also known as non-preemptive multitasking, 
> is a computer multitasking technique in which 
> the OS never initiates a context switch from a running process to another process. 
> 
> Instead, in order to run multiple applications concurrently, 
> processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle or logically blocked. 
> This type of multitasking is called cooperative 
> because all programs must cooperate for the scheduling scheme to work.  
>
> In this scheme, the process scheduler of an operating system is known as 
> a cooperative scheduler whose role is limited to starting the processes 
> and letting them return control back to it voluntarily.
>
> This is related to the asynchronous programming approach.
