## United_States_vs_American_Tobacco_Co @ 1911 
In order to promote market competition, four firms were created from the American Tobacco Company's assets: [American Tobacco Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Tobacco_Company "American Tobacco Company"), [R. J. Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Reynolds_Tobacco_Company "R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company"), [Liggett & Myers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liggett_Group "Liggett Group"), and [Lorillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorillard "Lorillard"). The monopoly became an oligopoly

## United_States_vs_Standard_Oil_Co @1911 
The _Standard Oil_ case 1911 resulted in the breakup of [Standard Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil "Standard Oil") 
into 43 separate companies. 
Many of these have since recombined; 
the largest present direct descendants of Standard Oil are 
- [ExxonMobil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil "ExxonMobil") (Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York) and 
- [Chevron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation "Chevron Corporation") (Standard Oil of California). 

Some Standard Oil descendants merged into other companies, 
particularly [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP "BP"), which acquired/merged with [Standard Oil of Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil_of_Ohio "Standard Oil of Ohio") and [Amoco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoco "Amoco"). 

## United_States_vs_AT&T@1982 

led to the 1984 [[Bell System]] [divestiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System "Breakup of the Bell System"), 
and the breakup of the old AT&T [natural monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly "Natural monopoly") 
into seven [regional Bell operating companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Bell_operating_companies "Regional Bell operating companies") 
and a much smaller new version of [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T "AT&T").
