> The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), also known as Berkeley Unix, 
> is a discontinued Unix operating system 
> developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) 
> at the University of California, Berkeley. 
> 
> First released in 1978, it began as an improved derivative of AT&T's original Unix 
> developed at Bell Labs, based on the source code. 
> Over time, BSD evolved into a distinct operating system 
> and played a significant role in computing and the development and dissemination of Unix-like systems.
>
> BSD development was initially led by Bill Joy, 
> who added virtual memory capability to Unix running on a VAX-11 computer. 
> During the 1980s, BSD gained widespread adoption by workstation vendors 
> in the form of proprietary Unix distributions—such as DEC with Ultrix 
> and Sun Microsystems with SunOS—due to its permissive licensing and familiarity among engineers. 
> 
> BSD also became the most widely used Unix variant in academic institutions, 
> where it was used for the study of operating systems. 
> The BSD project received funding from DARPA until 1988, 
> during which time BSD incorporated ARPANET support 
> and later implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite, released as part of BSD NET/1 in 1988. 
> 
> By that time, the codebase had diverged significantly from the original AT&T Unix, 
> with estimates suggesting that less than 5% of the code remained from AT&T. 
> As a result, NET/1 was distributed without requiring an AT&T source license.
>
> Berkeley ended its Unix research in 1992, following reduced funding 
> and complications arising from the Unix copyright lawsuit. 
> As the original BSD became obsolete, the term "BSD" came to refer primarily to 
> its open-source descendants, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD. 
> 
> BSD-derived code also formed the basis for Darwin and TrueOS; 
> these, in turn, have been incorporated into proprietary operating systems, 
> including Apple's macOS and iOS, as well as Windows NT 3.1 
> which used portions of BSD's TCP/IP implementation. 
> 
> Code from BSD's open descendants have themselves also 
> been integrated into various modern platforms, including 
> the system software for the PlayStation 5 and other embedded or commercial devices.
