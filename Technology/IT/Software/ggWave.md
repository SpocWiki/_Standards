generate and analyze the RAW waveforms that are played and captured from your audio devices 
bandwidth rate is between 8-16 bytes/sec  =  64-128 bit/s depending on the protocol parameters. 
Error correction codes (ECC) are used to improve demodulation robustness 
Uses multi-frequency [Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying) modulation scheme
