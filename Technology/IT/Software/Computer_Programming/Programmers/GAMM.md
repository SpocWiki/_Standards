> **Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik** ("Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics"), 
> often referred to by the acronym GAMM, is a German society for the promotion of science, 
> founded in 1922 by the physicist Ludwig Prandtl and the mathematician Richard von Mises.  
> The society awards the Richard von Mises prize annually. 
> The society publishes the journal GAMM-Mitteilungen (Surveys for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) and 
> Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) through Wiley. 
> 
> According to the statutes, GAMM aims 
> "to maintain and promote scientific work and international cooperation in applied mathematics 
> as well as in all sub-areas of mechanics and physics that are part of the fundamentals the engineerings count." 
> 
> The GAMM pursues this goal primarily by organizing scientific conferences. 
> The GAMM's most important event is the annual conference, 
> which takes place annually in Germany or neighboring countries and is attended by hundreds of scientists, 
> primarily because of its scientific program. 
> 
> The proceedings volume (PAMM) is published every year at the conference. 
> In addition, further conferences on specific areas from the spectrum of disciplines represented in the GAMM take place.
> In 1958 the GAMM and the ACM together worked out the "ALGOL 58 Report" at a meeting in Zurich.
