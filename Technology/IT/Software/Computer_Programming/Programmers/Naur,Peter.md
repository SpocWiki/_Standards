## Programming Views 
[[Naur,Peter]] argues that Programming is Theory-Building. 

### Production View 

Programmers are replaceable Cogs 
Code, Tests and Documentation are the real Output 

### Theory-Building Process 

Developers have a multi-level Mapping between Code and real World in their mind. 
This has multiple Benefits: 
- bi-directional Mapping to real World 
- Technical Decision Making[[../../../../../../IT/SW~Architecture/ADR(Architecture_Decision_Records)|ADR(Architecture_Decision_Records)]]] 
- Requirements Changes 
	- need to know the Repo of Building Blocks and whether to rewrite or extend 
	- very often new Programmers destroy the Elegance, 
	  because they don't fully understand the flexibility of the existing Solution. 
	  - fixes are often just latched on, 
	    with very specific if-conditions to minimize side-effects. 
	- this creates Frankenstein-Code
