> John Warner Backus  (December 3, 1924 – March 17, 2007) 
> was an American computer scientist. 
> He led the team that invented and implemented FORTRAN, 
> the first widely used high-level programming language, 
> and was the inventor of the [[BNF(Backus–Naur_Form)]], 
> a widely used notation to define syntaxes of formal languages. 
> He later did research into the function-level programming paradigm, 
> presenting his findings in his influential 1977 Turing Award lecture 
> "Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?"
>
> The IEEE awarded Backus the W. W. McDowell Award in 1967 
> for the development of FORTRAN. 
> He received the National Medal of Science in 1975 and the 1977 Turing Award 
> "for profound, influential, and lasting contributions to the design 
> of practical high-level programming systems, notably through his work on FORTRAN, 
> and for publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages".
