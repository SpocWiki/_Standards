## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In computer science, Backus–Naur form (**BNF**; Backus normal form) 
> is a notation used to describe the syntax of formal (programming-) languages. 
> It was developed by John Backus and Peter Naur. 
> 
> BNF can be described as a metasyntax notation for context-free grammars. 
> Backus–Naur form is applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed, 
> such as in official language specifications, in manuals, 
> and in textbooks on programming language theory. 
> BNF can be used to describe document formats, instruction sets, 
> and communication protocols.
>
> Many extensions and variants of the original Backus–Naur notation have been created; 
> some are exactly defined, including extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) 
> and augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF).

## EBNF

> In computer science, extended Backus–Naur form (**EBNF**) 
> is a family of metasyntax notations, 
> any of which can be used to express a context-free grammar.  
> EBNF is used to make a formal description of a formal (programming-) language. 
> They are extensions of the basic Backus–Naur form (BNF) metasyntax notation.
>
> The earliest EBNF was developed by Niklaus Wirth, incorporating some of the concepts 
> (with a different syntax and notation) from Wirth syntax notation. 
> Today, many variants of EBNF are in use.
>
> The International Organization for Standardization 
> adopted an EBNF Standard, ISO/IEC 14977, in 1996.
>
> According to Zaytsev, however, this standard 
> "only ended up adding yet another three dialects to the chaos" 
> and, after noting its lack of success, also notes that 
> the ISO EBNF is not even used in all ISO standards.
>
> Wheeler argues against using the ISO standard when using an EBNF 
> and recommends considering alternative EBNF notations 
> such as the one from the W3C Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition).
>
> This article uses EBNF as specified by the ISO for examples applying to all EBNFs. Other EBNF variants use somewhat different syntactic conventions.
