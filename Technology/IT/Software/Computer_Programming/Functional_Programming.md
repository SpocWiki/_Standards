> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm 
> where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. 
> 
> It is a declarative programming paradigm 
> in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, 
> rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.
>
> In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, 
> meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, 
> and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. 
> This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, 
> where small functions are combined in a modular manner.
>
> Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with **purely functional programming**, 
> a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, 
> or pure functions. 
> 
> When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, 
> and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. 
> This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, 
> which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). 
> 
> Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, 
> programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.
>
> Functional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, 
> a formal system of computation based only on functions. 
> 
> Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, 
> but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including 
> Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, Haskell, and F#. 
> 
> Lean is a functional programming language commonly used for verifying mathematical theorems. 
> 
> Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, 
> like JavaScript in the Web, R in statistics, J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML. 
> 
> Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc 
> use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values. 
> 
> In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style 
> or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++ (since C++11), 
> C#, Kotlin, Perl, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, Raku, Scala, and Java (since Java 8).
