> Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 
> and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (**J2EE**), is a set of specifications, 
> extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise features 
> such as distributed computing and web services. 
> 
> Jakarta EE applications are run on reference runtimes, 
> which can be microservices or application servers, 
> which handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency 
> and management of the components they are deploying.
>
> Jakarta EE is defined by its specification. 
> The specification defines APIs (application programming interface) and their interactions. 
> As with other Java Community Process specifications, 
> providers must meet certain conformance requirements 
> in order to declare their products as Jakarta EE compliant.
>
> Examples of contexts in which Jakarta EE referencing runtimes are used are: 
> e-commerce, accounting, banking information systems.
