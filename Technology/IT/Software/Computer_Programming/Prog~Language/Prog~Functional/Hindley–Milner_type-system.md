# [[Hindley–Milner_type-system]] 

> A Hindley–Milner (HM) type system is a classical type system 
> for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism. 
> 
> It is also known as Damas–Milner or Damas–Hindley–Milner. 
> It was first described by J. Roger Hindley 
> and later rediscovered by Robin Milner. 
> 
> Luis Damas contributed a close formal analysis and proof of the method in his PhD thesis. 
> 
> Among HM's more notable properties are its completeness and its 
> __ability to infer the most general type__ of a given program 
> without programmer-supplied type annotations or other hints. 
> 
> Algorithm W is an efficient type inference method in practice 
> and has been successfully applied on large code bases, 
> although it has a high theoretical complexity. 
> 
> HM is preferably used for functional languages to reduce Type Annotation. 
> 
> It was first implemented as part of the type system of the programming language ML. 
> 
> Since then, HM has been extended in various ways, most notably with type class constraints like those in Haskell.
