# Interpreters 

Interpreters can be more powerful than Compilers, 
because they work with the Runtime-Data, instead of only Schema-Data as Compilers do. 

Therefore dynamic Languages are an ideal Fit for Interpreters. 
The biggest Interpreter Successes are: 
- Python 
- VisualBasic 
- JavaScript 
- 

But Compilers force Developers to acknowledge Unsafeties in Type and Reference!
