In 2012, Datomic, a proprietary distributed database was launched which coincided with the incorporation of Cognitect.  From 2013 until 2020, he was the chief technology officer of Cognitect. Cognitect was acquired by Nubank in 2020, and he was a Distinguished Engineer at Nubank until August 2023 when he announced his retirement from commercial software development.
