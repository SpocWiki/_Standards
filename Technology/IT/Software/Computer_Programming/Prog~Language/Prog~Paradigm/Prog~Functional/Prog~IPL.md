> Information Processing Language (IPL) is a programming language created by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation and the Carnegie Institute of Technology about 1956.  Newell had the job of language specifier-application programmer, Shaw was the system programmer, and Simon had the job of application programmer-user.

> The code includes features intended to help with programs that perform simple problem solving actions such as lists, dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, functions as arguments, generators, and cooperative multitasking.  IPL invented the concept of list processing, albeit in an assembly-language style.

IPL was first utilized to demonstrate that the theorems in _[Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica "Principia Mathematica")_ which were proven laboriously by hand, by [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") and [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead"), could in fact be [proven by computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving"). According to Simon's autobiography _Models of My Life_, this application was originally developed first by hand simulation, using his children as the computing elements, while writing on and holding up note cards as the registers which contained the state variables of the program.

IPL was used to implement several early [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") programs, also by the same authors: the [Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist "Logic Theorist") (1956), the [General Problem Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver "General Problem Solver") (1957), and their [computer chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess "Computer chess") program [NSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NSS_(chess_program)&action=edit&redlink=1 "NSS (chess program) (page does not exist)") (1958).

Several versions of IPL were created: IPL-I (never implemented), IPL-II (1957 for [JOHNNIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOHNNIAC "JOHNNIAC")), IPL-III (existed briefly), IPL-IV, IPL-V (1958, widely used on [[IBM~Mainframe]]s 

IPL was soon displaced by [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) "Lisp (programming language)"), which had much more powerful features, a simpler syntax, and the benefit of automatic [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "Garbage collection (computer science)").
