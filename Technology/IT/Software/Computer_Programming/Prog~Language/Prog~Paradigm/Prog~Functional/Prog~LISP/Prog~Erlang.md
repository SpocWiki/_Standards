> Erlang ( UR-lang) is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional high-level programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system. 
> 
> The term Erlang is used interchangeably with Erlang/OTP, or Open Telecom Platform (OTP), which consists of the Erlang runtime system, several ready-to-use components (OTP) mainly written in Erlang, and a set of design principles for Erlang programs.The Erlang runtime system is designed for systems with these traits:
> - Distributed
> - Fault-tolerant
> - Soft real-time
> - Highly available, non-stop applications
> - Hot swapping, where code can be changed without stopping a system.
> 
> The Erlang programming language has immutable data, pattern matching, and functional programming. 
> The sequential subset of the Erlang language supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing.
>
> A normal Erlang application is built out of hundreds of small Erlang processes.
>
> It was originally proprietary software within Ericsson, 
> developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams in 1986, but was released as free and open-source software in 1998. 
> Erlang/OTP is supported and maintained by the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) product unit at Ericsson.
