Imperative Programming is the lowest and most common Form. 
It involves specifying in Detail what the Computer should do and exactly in which Order. 

When using lowest-Level Constructs, this Paradigm does not scale, because of Volume and missing Abstraction. 

The next Level is [[Prog~Paradigm/Prog~Structured]], which allows to build higher-Level Routines.
