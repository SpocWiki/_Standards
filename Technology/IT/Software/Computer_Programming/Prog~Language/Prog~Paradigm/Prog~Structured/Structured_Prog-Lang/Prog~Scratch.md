Scratch uses 2 Notches to compose Blocks. 
- a Block is a single Statement or Function Call and has 2 Notches: 
	- one at the Top to the previous Statement 
	- and one at the Bottom for the next Statement 
	- Events don't have a Top Notch, because they are invoked by the Runtime. 
	- Stop has no Bottom Notch, because it stops execution of either this or all Threads 
- Loops have a Body where you can plug Blocks into 
- If-Then-Else has 2 Bodies 
- boolean Expressions (used in IFs and LOOPs) have a [[../../../../../../../../Mathematics/Geometry/Geometry-2D/Rhombus]] Shape 
- other Expressions have a rounded [[../../../../../../Knowledge/Math/Geometry/2D-Geometry/Squircle|Squircle]]
