> **flow-matic**, originally known as B-0 (Business Language version 0), was the first English-like data processing language. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand under Grace Hopper from 1955 to 1959, and helped shape the development of COBOL.

Grace Hopper developed the A-0_System  an early [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") in 1951 and 1952 originally for the [UNIVAC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I "UNIVAC I"). The A-0 functioned more as a [loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing) "Loader (computing)") or [linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing) "Linker (computing)") than the modern notion of a compiler.
The A-0 system was followed by the A-1, A-2, A-3 (released as [ARITH-MATIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARITH-MATIC "ARITH-MATIC")), AT-3 (released as [MATH-MATIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATH-MATIC "MATH-MATIC")) and B-0 (released as [FLOW-MATIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC "FLOW-MATIC")).

[[COBOL]]s Design is heavily influenced by this.
