> **ISWIM** (acronym for If you See What I Mean) is an abstract computer programming language (or a family of languages) devised by [[Landin~Peter]] and first described in his article "The Next 700 Programming Languages", published in the Communications of the ACM in 1966.
> 
> Although not implemented, it has proved very influential in the development of programming languages, especially functional programming languages such as SASL, Miranda, ML, Haskell and their successors, and dataflow programming languages like Lucid.
