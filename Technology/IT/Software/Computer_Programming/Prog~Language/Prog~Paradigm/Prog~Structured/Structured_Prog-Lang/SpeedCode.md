> **Speedcoding**, Speedcode or SpeedCo was the first high-level programming language created for an IBM computer. 
> The language was developed by John W. Backus in 1953 for the IBM 701 to support computation with  floating point numbers.
> The idea arose from the difficulty of programming the IBM SSEC machine when Backus was hired to calculate astronomical positions in early 1950.
>
> The speedcoding system was an interpreter 
> and focused on ease of use at the expense of system resources. 
> 
> It provided pseudo-instructions for common mathematical functions: 
> logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations. 
> 
> The resident software analyzed pseudo-instructions one by one and called the appropriate subroutine. 
> 
> Speedcoding was also the first implementation of decimal input/output operations. 
> 
> Although it substantially reduced the effort of writing many jobs, the running time of a program that was written with the help of Speedcoding was usually ten to twenty times that of machine code. 
> 
> The interpreter took 310 memory words, about 30% of the memory available on a 701.
