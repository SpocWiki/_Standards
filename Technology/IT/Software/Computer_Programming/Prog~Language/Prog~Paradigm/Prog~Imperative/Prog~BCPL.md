> **BCPL** ("Basic Combined Programming Language") is a procedural, imperative, and structured programming language.  
> Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based.  
> BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, 
> including using __curly braces to delimit code blocks__ instead of Keywords like [[../Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Prog~Pascal|Prog~Pascal]] or [[../Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Prog~BASIC|Prog~BASIC]]. 
> BCPL was first implemented 
> by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967.
