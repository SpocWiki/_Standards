Assembler is considered to be a 2nd Generation Programming Language, 
different from the 1st Generation [[Machine-Language]]. 

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In computer programming,  assembly language 
> (alternatively assembler language or symbolic machine code), 
> often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, 
> is any low-level programming language 
> with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language 
> and the architecture's machine code instructions. 
> 
> Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), 
> but  constants, comments, assembler directives, symbolic 
> labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros are generally also supported.
>
> The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions 
> is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C.. 
> 
> Assembly code is converted into executable machine code 
> by a utility program referred to as an assembler. 
> 
> The term "assembler" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill 
> in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer, 
> who, however, used the term to mean 
> "a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program". 
> 
> The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. 
> The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time.
>
> Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, 
> each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture.
> 
> Sometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture, 
> and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems. 
> 
> Most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls, 
> and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system, 
> as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor, 
> upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. 
> 
> In contrast to assembly languages, 
> most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures 
> but require interpreting or compiling, much more complicated tasks than assembling.
>
> In the first decades of computing, 
> it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming 
> to take place entirely in assembly language.  
> 
> While still irreplaceable for some purposes, 
> the majority of programming is now conducted in higher-level interpreted and compiled languages.  
> In "[[No_Silver_Bullet]]", 
> [[Brooks,Fred]] summarised the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming: 
> "Surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity, reliability, and simplicity 
> has been the progressive use of high-level languages for programming. 
> Most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity, 
> and with concomitant gains in reliability, simplicity, and comprehensibility." 
> 
> Today, it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code 
> within larger systems implemented in a higher-level language, for performance reasons 
> or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher-level language.  
> For instance, just under 2% of version 4.9 of the Linux kernel source code 
> is written in assembly; more than 97% is written in C.
