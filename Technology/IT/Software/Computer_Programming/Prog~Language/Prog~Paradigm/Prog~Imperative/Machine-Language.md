[[Prog~Assembler]] is considered to be a 2nd Generation Programming Language, 
different from the 1st Generation [[Machine-Language]]. 

> In computer programming, 
> machine code is computer code consisting of **Machine Language** instructions, 
> which are used to control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). 
> 
> Although decimal computers were once common, 
> the contemporary marketplace is dominated by binary computers; 
> for those computers, machine code is "the binary representation of a computer program 
> which is actually read and interpreted by the computer. 
> A program in machine code consists of a sequence of machine instructions 
> (possibly interspersed with data)." 
> 
> Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, 
> or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.
>
> Early CPUs had specific machine code 
> that might break backward compatibility with each new CPU released. 
> 
> The notion of an [[(ISA)instruction_set_architecture]] defines and specifies the behavior 
> and encoding in memory of the instruction set of the system, 
> without specifying its exact implementation. 
> This acts as an abstraction layer, enabling compatibility within the same family of CPUs, 
> so that machine code written or generated according to the ISA for the family 
> will run on all CPUs in the family, including future CPUs.
>
> In general, each architecture family (e.g. x86, ARM) has its own ISA, 
> and hence its own specific machine code language. 
> There are exceptions, such as the VAX architecture, 
> which included optional support of the PDP-11 instruction set 
> and IA-64, which included optional support of the IA-32 instruction set. 
> Another example is the PowerPC 615, 
> a processor designed to natively process both PowerPC and x86 instructions. 
>
> Machine code is a strictly numerical language, 
> and is the lowest-level interface to the CPU intended for a programmer. 
> Assembly language provides a direct mapping between the numerical machine code 
> and a human-readable version where numerical opcodes and operands are replaced by readable strings 
> (e.g. 0x90 is the NOP instruction on x86). 
> 
> While it is possible to write programs directly in machine code, 
> managing individual bits and calculating numerical addresses and constants 
> manually is tedious and error-prone. 
> 
> For this reason, programs are very rarely written directly in machine code in modern contexts, 
> but may be done for low-level debugging, program patching 
> (especially when assembler source is not available) and assembly language disassembly.
>
> The majority of practical programs today are written in higher-level languages. 
> Those programs are either translated into machine code by a compiler, 
> or are interpreted by an interpreter, usually after being translated into an intermediate code, 
> such as a bytecode, that is then interpreted. 
> 
> Machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer, 
> but internally many processors use [[microcode]] 
> or optimize and transform machine code instructions into sequences of micro-ops. 
> Microcode and micro-ops are not generally considered to be machine code; 
> except on some machines, the user cannot write microcode or micro-ops, 
> and the operation of microcode and the transformation of machine-code instructions into micro-ops 
> happens transparently to the programmer except for performance related side effects.
