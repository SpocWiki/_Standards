> A fail-fast system is one that 
> immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure. 
> Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation 
> rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. 
> 
> Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, 
> so that any failures can be detected early.  
> 
> The responsibility of a fail-fast module is detecting errors, 
> and then letting the next-highest level of the system handle them.
