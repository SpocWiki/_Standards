# [[Prog~Structured]] 

## Edit

Structured Programming was initiated in the late 1950s 
and influenced e.g. [[Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Algol]] and [[Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Prog~Pascal]]

The [[Prog~Structured/Structured_program_theorem]] proved 1966 
that any computable Function can be realized 
using only these 4 Structures in ascending Complexity: 
1. [[Prog~Structured/Structure~Sequence|Sequence]] 
2. [[Prog~Structured/Structure~Subroutine|Subroutine]]  
3. [[Prog~Structured/Structure~Switch|Switch]]  
4. [[Prog~Structured/Strucure~Loop|Loop]] 
5. [[Prog~Structured/Exception-Handling]] was added later to decouple Results from Errors 
6. [[Prog~Structured/Break_and_early_Return]]  should be allowed to reduce cognitive Load and Nesting 
7. [[Delegate]]s or [[Prog~Structured/Function-Pointer]]s allow for dynamic Logic. 

These Components have their Counterparts in[[Prog~Functional]]]. 

Similarly, there are corresponding Link-Structures, 
that provide better Structure than random (GOTO-)Graphs: 
1. Linear Sections 
2. Named Sub-Graphs 
3. Alternatives 
4. Cycles or Loop-Nodes with Sub-Graphs . 

They are better represented in a [[Prog~Structured/Structogram]], 
than with a[[../../../../IT/Data/Data~Graphics/Text-Diagrams/Diagram~Mermaid/MMD~Flowchart-Diagram|MMD~Flowchart-Diagram]]].
