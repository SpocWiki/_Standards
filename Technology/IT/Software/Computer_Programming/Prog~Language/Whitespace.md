> A **Whitespace** character is a character data element that represents white space when text is rendered for display by a computer.
>
> For example, a space character (U+0020   SPACE, ASCII 32) represents blank space such as a word divider in a Western script.
>
> A printable character results in output when rendered, but a whitespace character does not.
>
> Instead, whitespace characters define the layout of text to a limited degree, interrupting the normal sequence of rendering characters next to each other. 
>
> The output of subsequent characters is typically shifted to the right (or to the left for right-to-left script) or to the start of the next line. 
>
> The effect of multiple sequential whitespace characters is cumulative such that the next printable character is rendered 
> at a location based on the accumulated effect of preceding whitespace characters.
>
> The term whitespace is rooting in the common practice of rendering text on white paper. 
> Normally, a whitespace character is not rendered as white. It affects rendering, but it is not itself rendered.
