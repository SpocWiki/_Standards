Actor-based frameworks provide a robust approach to building concurrent and distributed systems. 
It can be considered an extreme form of [[Prog~OO]], 
because the Objects communicate through serialized messages exclusively, never sharing State. 
This allows to introduce reliable Messaging and Distribution resulting in high Scalability. 

This is an advancement over [[J2EE]] Server Model.

#### Grain AKA Instance 

The grain is one of several Orleans primitives. In terms of the actor model, a grain is a virtual actor. The fundamental building block in any Orleans application is a _grain_. Grains are entities comprising user-defined identity, behavior, and state.

#### Silo AKA Server 
A silo is another example of an Orleans primitive. A silo hosts one or more grains. The Orleans runtime is what implements the programming model for applications.

When a grain is activated in Orleans, the runtime decides which server (silo) to activate that grain on. This is called grain placement.

The placement process in Orleans is fully configurable. Developers can choose from a set of out-of-the-box placement policies such as random, prefer-local, and load-based, or custom logic can be configured.

Reminders are a durable scheduling mechanism for grains.
