CPP is a high-level, general-purpose programming language 
created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. 
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, 
it has since expanded significantly over time; 
as of 1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, 
in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 

It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. 

C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).
