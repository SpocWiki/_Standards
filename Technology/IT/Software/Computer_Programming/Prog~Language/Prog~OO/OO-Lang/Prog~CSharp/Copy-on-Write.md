https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write sometimes referred to as [implicit sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#cite_note-1) or [shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#cite_note-2) is a resource-management technique used in [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") to efficiently implement a "duplicate" or "copy" operation on modifiable resources.
If a resource is duplicated but not modified, it is not necessary to create a new resource; the resource can be shared between the copy and the original. Modifications must still create a copy, hence the technique: the copy operation is deferred until the first write. By sharing resources in this way, it is possible to significantly reduce the resource consumption of unmodified copies, while adding a small overhead to resource-modifying operations.
