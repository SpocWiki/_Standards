OO-Languages are primarily characterized by: 
- [[OO~Encapsulation]] 
- [[../../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.2/Patterns~GRASP/Pattern~Polymorphism|Pattern~Polymorphism]] 

Therefore also [[OO-Lang/Prog~VB|Prog~VB]] is an OO-Language. 

[[OO~Inheritance]] is not essential, although it is useful.
