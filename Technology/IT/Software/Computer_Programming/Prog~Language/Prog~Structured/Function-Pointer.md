Function Pointers should be typed, to ensure the [[Call-Stack]] is filled and cleaned up correctly. 
These Pointers are polymorph, because they can be exchanged with different Strategies/Algorithms. 
They also often support [[../Prog~OO/Variance,OO|Variance,OO]], i.e. they can be substituted with 
- more __generic Parameters__ and/or 
- more __specific Results__. 

In practice, most modern programming languages use the callee-cleanup model, 
especially those with automatic memory management features like garbage collection. 

This convention also aligns with the structured programming principles of Pascal, 
where procedures and functions are self-contained units 
responsible for their own cleanup, promoting modular and maintainable code.

Only C/C++ has the convention of the Caller cleaning up the Stack.
