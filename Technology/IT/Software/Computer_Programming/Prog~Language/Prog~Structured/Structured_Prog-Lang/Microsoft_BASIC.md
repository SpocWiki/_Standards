> Microsoft BASIC is the foundation software product of the Microsoft company and evolved into a line of BASIC interpreters and compiler(s) adapted for many different microcomputers. 
> It first appeared in 1975 as Altair BASIC, which was the first version of BASIC published by Microsoft as well as the first high-level programming language available for the Altair 8800 microcomputer.
>
> During the home computer craze during the late-1970s and early-1980s, BASIC was ported to and supplied with many home computer designs. Slight variations to add support for machine-specific functions, especially graphics, led to a profusion of related designs like [[Commodore BASIC]] and [[Atari Microsoft BASIC]].
>
> As the early home computers gave way to newer designs like the IBM Personal Computer and Macintosh, BASIC was no longer as widely used, although it retained a strong following. The release of [[../../Prog~OO/OO-Lang/Prog~VB|Visual-Basic]] re-boosted its popularity and it remains in wide use on Microsoft Windows platforms in its most recent incarnation, [[../../Prog~OO/OO-Lang/Prog~VB/Prog~VB.NET|Prog~VB.NET]].
