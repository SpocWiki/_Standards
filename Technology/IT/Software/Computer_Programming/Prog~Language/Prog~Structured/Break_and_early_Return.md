These are 'Shortcuts' in [[../Prog~Structured]]. 
Although by some, they reduce the mental Load by reducing the amount of Code and Variables. 

## Break-Statement 

The Break-Statement allows to test a Loop Condition within the Loop. 
This can also be achieved with if-statements, but 
## early_Return 

This is especially useful for testing pre-conditions. 
It is wasteful and confusing to wrap the whole logic into `if ... else if ...` Statements 
when a series of simple Checks lead to an early decision which can then be mentally discarded. 

This makes the core logic simpler and briefer.
