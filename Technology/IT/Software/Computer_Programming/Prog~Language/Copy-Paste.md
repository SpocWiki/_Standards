[[Copy-Paste]]-Programming is one of the most proliferate Design Problems in Software. 
Since the advent of AI-powered Support like [[../../../../Knowledge/AGI(Artificial_general_Intelligence)/Products~AGI/Github-CoPilot|Github-CoPilot]], 
this has even more increased, leading to Code-Bloat. 

Code is an Asset,
but it is also a Liability when you have to maintain it. 

Maintenance is usually an easy task, that can be performed by medium-skilled developers, 
but when the code-base needs to be migrated or invasive Features have to be added, 
especially the so-called non-functional (i.e. non-located) Features, 
this requires architectural attention. 

Consolidating duplicate Code incurs the same risk as modifying shared code. 

The Business problem now is to decide when to tackle this risk. 
Surely not before the software has become a viable Product.
