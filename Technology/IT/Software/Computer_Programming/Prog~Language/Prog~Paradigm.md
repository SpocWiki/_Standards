> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way 
> to conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program. 
> A programming language can be classified as supporting one or more paradigms.
>
> Paradigms are separated along and described by different dimensions of programming. 
> Some paradigms are about implications of the execution model, such as allowing side effects, 
> or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. 
> Other paradigms are about the way code is organized, 
> such as grouping into units that include both state and behavior. 
> Yet others are about syntax and grammar.
>
> Some common programming paradigms include (shown in hierarchical relationship):
> - Imperative – code directly controls execution flow and state change, explicit statements that change a program state
> - procedural – organized as procedures that call each other
> - object-oriented – organized as objects that contain both data structure and associated behavior, uses data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions (objects) to design programs
> - Class-based – object-oriented programming in which inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects, versus the objects themselves
> - Prototype-based – object-oriented programming that avoids classes and implements inheritance via cloning of instances
> - Declarative – code declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it, describes what computation should perform, without specifying detailed state changes
> - functional – a desired result is declared as the value of a series of function evaluations, uses evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
> - logic – a desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules, uses explicit mathematical logic for programming
> - reactive – a desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change
> - Concurrent programming – has language constructs for concurrency, these may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources (including shared memory), or futures
> - Actor programming – concurrent computation with actors that make local decisions in response to the environment (capable of selfish or competitive behaviour)
> - Constraint programming – relations between variables are expressed as constraints (or constraint networks), directing allowable solutions (uses constraint satisfaction or simplex algorithm)
> - Dataflow programming – forced recalculation of formulas when data values change (e.g. spreadsheets)
> - Distributed programming – has support for multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computer networks
> - Generic programming – uses algorithms written in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated as needed for specific types provided as parameters
> - Metaprogramming – writing programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime
> - Template metaprogramming – metaprogramming methods in which a compiler uses templates to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled
> - Reflective programming – metaprogramming methods in which a program modifies or extends itself
> - Pipeline programming – a simple syntax change to add syntax to nest function calls to language originally designed with none
> - Rule-based programming – a network of rules of thumb that comprise a knowledge base and can be used for expert systems and problem deduction & resolution
> - Visual programming – manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually (e.g. Simulink); also termed diagrammatic programming
