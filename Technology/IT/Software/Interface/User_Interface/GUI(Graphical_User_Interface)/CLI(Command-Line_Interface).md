> A command-line interface (CLI), sometimes called a command-line shell, 
> is a means of interacting with software via commands – 
> each formatted as a line of text. 
> 
> Command-line interfaces emerged in the mid-1960s, on computer terminals, 
> as an interactive and more user-friendly 
> alternative to the non-interactive mode available with punched cards.
>
> For nearly three decades, a CLI was the most common interface for software, 
> but today a graphical user interface (GUI) is more common. 
> Nonetheless, many programs such as operating system 
> and software development utilities still provide CLI.
>
> A CLI enables automating programs since commands can be stored in a script file that can be used repeatedly. A script allows its contained commands to be executed as group; as a program; as a command.
>
> A CLI is made possible by command-line interpreters or command-line processors, which are programs that execute input commands.
>
> Alternatives to a CLI include a GUI (including the desktop metaphor such as Windows), text-based menuing (including DOS Shell and IBM AIX SMIT), and keyboard shortcuts.
