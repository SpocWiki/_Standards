> In computing, an icon is a pictogram or ideogram displayed on a computer screen 
> in order to help the user navigate a computer system. 
> 
> It can serve as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data. 
> The user can activate an icon using a mouse, pointer, finger, or voice commands. 
> Their placement on the screen, also in relation to other icons, 
> may provide further information to the user about their usage. 
> 
> In activating an icon, the user can move directly into and out of the identified function without knowing anything further about the location or requirements of the file or code.
>
> Icons as parts of the graphical user interface of a computer system, in conjunction with windows, menus and a pointing device (mouse), belong to the much larger topic of the history of the graphical user interface that has largely supplanted the text-based interface for casual use.
