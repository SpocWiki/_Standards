## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In computing, internationalization and localization (American) 
> or internationalisation and localisation (Commonwealth), 
> often abbreviated i18n and l10n respectively, 
> are means of adapting to different languages, 
> regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale.
>
> Internationalization is the process of designing a software application 
> so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. 
> 
> Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software 
> for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.
>
> Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) 
> uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization 
> (which is ideally performed only once before localization, or as an integral part of ongoing development).
