> Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license 
> in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, 
> and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. 
> 
> Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative, public manner. 
> Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration, 
> meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, 
> making the number of possible contributors indefinite. 
> The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software.
>
> Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives 
> beyond those of a single company. 
> 
> A 2024 estimate of the value of open-source software to firms is $8.8 trillion, 
> as firms would need to spend 3.5 times the amount they currently do 
> without the use of open source software.
>
> Open-source code can be used for studying 
> and allows capable end users to adapt software to their personal needs 
> in a similar way user scripts and custom style sheets allow for web sites, 
> and eventually publish the modification as a fork for users with similar preferences, 
> and directly submit possible improvements as pull requests.
