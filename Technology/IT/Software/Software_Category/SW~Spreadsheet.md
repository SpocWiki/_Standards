> A **Spreadsheet** is a computer application 
> for computation, organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form. 
> 
> Spreadsheets were developed as computerized **analogs of paper accounting worksheets**. 
> The program operates on data entered in cells of a table. 
> Each cell may contain either numeric or text data, 
> or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value 
> based on the contents of other cells. 
> The term spreadsheet may also refer to one such electronic document.
>
> In modern spreadsheet applications, several spreadsheets, 
> often known as "worksheets" or simply "sheets", are gathered together to form a "workbook". 
> 
> A workbook is physically represented by a file containing all the data for the book, 
> the sheets, and the cells with the sheets. 
> Worksheets are normally represented by tabs that flip between pages, 
> each one containing one of the sheets, although Numbers changes this model significantly. 
> 
> Cells in a multi-sheet book add the sheet name to their reference, for instance, "Sheet 1!C10". 
> Some systems extend this syntax to allow cell references to different workbooks.
>
> Spreadsheet users can adjust any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values. 
> This makes the spreadsheet useful for "what-if" analysis 
> since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation. 
> 
> Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets 
> and can display data either as text and numerals or in graphical form.
>
> Besides performing basic arithmetic and mathematical functions, modern spreadsheets provide 
> built-in functions for common financial accountancy and statistical operations. 
> 
> Such calculations as net present value, standard deviation, or regression analysis 
> can be applied to tabular data with a pre-programmed function in a formula. 
> Spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions, 
> functions to convert between text and numbers, and functions that operate on strings of text.
>
> Spreadsheets have replaced paper-based systems throughout the business world. 
> Although they were first developed for accounting or bookkeeping tasks, 
> they now are used extensively in any context where tabular lists are built, sorted, and shared.
