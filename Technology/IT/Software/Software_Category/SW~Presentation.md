> In computing, a **Presentation Program** (also called presentation software) 
> is a software package used to display information in the form of a slide show. 
> It has three major functions:
> - an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted
> - a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images and media clips
> - a slide-show system to display the content
>
> Presentation software can be viewed as 
> enabling a functionally-specific category of electronic media, 
> with its own distinct culture and practices as compared to traditional presentation media 
> (such as blackboards, whiteboards and flip charts).
>
> Presentations in this mode of delivery have become pervasive 
> in many aspects of business communication, especially in business planning, 
> as well as in academic-conference and professional conference settings, 
> and in the knowledge economy generally, where ideas are a primary work output. 
> 
> Presentations may also feature prominently in political settings, especially in workplace politics, 
> where persuasion is a central determinant of group outcomes.
>
> Most modern meeting-rooms and conference halls are configured to 
> include presentation electronics, such as projectors suitable for displaying presentation slides, 
> often driven by the presenter's own laptop, 
> under direct control of the presentation program used to develop the presentation. 
> 
> Often a presenter will present a lecture using the slides as a visual aid both for the presenter 
> (to track the lecture's coverage) and for the audience 
> (especially when an audience member mishears or misunderstands the verbal component).
>
> Generally in presentations, the visual material is considered supplemental 
> to a strong aural presentation that accompanies the slide show, 
> but in many cases, such as statistical graphics, 
> it can be difficult to convey essential information other than by visual means; 
> additionally, a well-designed infographic can be extremely effective in a way that words are not. 
> 
> Endemic over-reliance on slides with low information density 
> and with a poor accompanying lecture has given presentation software a negative reputation 
> as sometimes functioning as a crutch for the poorly informed or the poorly prepared.
