## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages, 
> and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user's query. 
> 
> The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app, 
> and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks 
> accompanied by textual summaries and images. 
> 
> Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as 
> images, videos, or news.
>
> For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system 
> that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. 
> 
> The speed and accuracy of an engine's response to a query 
> are based on a complex system of indexing 
> that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers. 
> 
> This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers, 
> although some content is not accessible to crawlers.
>
> There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s; 
> however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. 
> 
> As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, 
> - Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: 
> - Bing (~4 %), 
> - Yandex (~2.5 %), 
> - Yahoo! (~1.3 %), 
> - DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and 
> - Baidu (~0.7 %). 
> 
> Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade 
> that Google's share has fallen below the 90% threshold. 
> 
> The business of websites improving their visibility in search results, 
> known as marketing and optimization, has thus largely focused on Google.
