> A **computer scientist** is a scientist who specializes in the academic study of computer science. 
>
> Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computation. 
> Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas 
> (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, 
> information theory, database theory, theoretical computer science, numerical analysis, 
> programming language theory, compiler, computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, 
> computer architecture, operating system), 
> their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.
>
> A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models, often mathematical, 
> to describe the properties of computational systems (processors, programs, 
> computers interacting with people, computers interacting with other computers, etc.) 
> with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits 
> (faster, smaller, cheaper, more precise, etc.).
