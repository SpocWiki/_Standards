> Gary Arlen Kildall (; May 19, 1942 â€“ July 11, 1994) 
> was an American computer scientist and microcomputer entrepreneur. 
> 
> During the 1970s, Kildall created the operating system CP/M among other operating systems 
> and programming tools, and subsequently founded Digital Research, Inc. 
> to market and sell his software products. 
> He is considered a pioneer of the personal computer revolution.
>
> In 1974 in Pacific Grove, California, Kildall demonstrated the first working prototype of CP/M, 
> which would later become the dominant operating system for microcomputers for a time. 
> 
> Together with his invention of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System), 
> his operating system allowed a microprocessor-based computer 
> to communicate with disk storage. 
> 
> Kildall was among the earliest individuals 
> to recognize microprocessors as fully capable computers. 
> During the 1980s, Kildall also appeared on PBS as co-host of Computer Chronicles, 
> a weekly informational program that discussed the latest developments in personal computing.
