## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Alex Krizhevsky** is a Ukrainian-born Canadian computer scientist 
> most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning. 
> In 2012, Krizhevsky, [[Sutskever,Ilya|Ilya Sutskever]] and their PhD advisor [[Hinton,Geoffrey|Geoffrey Hinton]], at the University of Toronto, 
> developed a powerful visual-recognition network [[AlexNet]] using only two GeForce NVIDIA GPU cards. 
> 
> This revolutionized research in neural networks. Previously neural networks were trained on CPUs. 
> The transition to GPUs opened the way to the development of advanced AI models. 
> AlexNet [[../../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization/Company/Corporation/IT~Company/Amazon(Company)/ImageNet|ImageNet]] challenge in 2012. 
> Krizhevsky and Sutskever sold their startup, DNN Research Inc., to Google, 
> shortly after winning the contest. 
> 
> Krizhevsky left Google in September 2017 after losing interest in the work, 
> to work at the company Dessa in support of new deep-learning techniques. 
> 
> Many of his numerous papers on machine learning and computer vision 
> are frequently cited by other researchers. 
> He is also the main author of the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
