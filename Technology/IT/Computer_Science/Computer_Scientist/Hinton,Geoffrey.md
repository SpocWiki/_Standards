> Geoffrey Everest Hinton  (born 6 December 1947) 
> is a British-Canadian  computer scientist and cognitive psychologist, 
> most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. 
> 
> From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) 
> and the University of Toronto, before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023, 
> citing concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. 
> In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor 
> of the Vector Institute in Toronto.
>
> With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly 
> cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the [[backpropagation-algorithm]] 
> for training multi-layer neural networks, 
> although they were not the first to propose the approach. 
> 
> Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. 
> The image-recognition milestone of the [[AlexNet|AlexNet]] 
> designed in collaboration with his student[[Krizhevsky,Alex]]]] an[[Sutskever,Ilya]]]] for [[../../../../Society/Agent/Community/Organization/Company/Corporation/IT~Company/Amazon(Company)/ImageNet|ImageNet]]] challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.
>
> Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award, often referred to as the 
> "Nobel Prize of Computing", together with [[Yoshua Bengio]] an[[LeCun,Yann]]]], 
> for their work on deep learning. 
> They are sometimes referred to as the "Godfathers of Deep Learning", 
> and have continued to give public talks together.
>
> In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google 
> to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of A.I." 
> 
> He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, 
> technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence. 
> He noted that establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation 
> among those competing in use of AI in order to avoid the worst outcomes.
