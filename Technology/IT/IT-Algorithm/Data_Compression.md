> In information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction 
> is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. 
> 
> Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless
> . Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. 
> No information is lost in lossless compression. 
> 
> Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. 
> 
> Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, 
> and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.
>
> The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression. 
> 
> In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding: 
> encoding is done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted. 
> Source coding should not be confused with channel coding, 
> for error detection and correction or line coding, the means for mapping data onto a signal.
>
> Data compression algorithms present a spaceâ€“time complexity trade-off 
> - between the bytes needed to store or transmit information, 
> - and the computational resources needed to perform the encoding and decoding. 
> 
> The design of data compression schemes involves balancing the degree of compression, 
> the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), 
> and the computational resources or time required to compress and decompress the data.
