> **Data** ( DAY-tə, US also  DAT-ə) are a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, 
> describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, 
> or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.  
> 
> A datum is an individual value in a collection of data. 
> Data are usually organized into structures such as tables that provide additional context and meaning, 
> and may themselves be used as data in larger structures. 
> Data may be used as variables in a computational process. 
> Data may represent abstract ideas or concrete measurements.
>
> Data are commonly used in scientific research, economics, 
> and virtually every other form of human organizational activity.  
> Examples of data sets include price indices (such as the consumer price index), 
> unemployment rates, literacy rates, and census data. 
> 
> In this context, data represent the raw facts and figures from which useful information can be extracted.
>
> Data are collected using techniques such as measurement, observation, query, or analysis, 
> and are typically represented as numbers or characters that may be further processed. 
> 
> Field data are data that are collected in an uncontrolled, in-situ environment. 
> Experimental data are data that are generated in the course of a controlled scientific experiment.  
> 
> Data are analyzed using techniques such as calculation, 
> reasoning, discussion, presentation, visualization, or other forms of post-analysis. 
> Prior to analysis, raw data (or unprocessed data) is typically cleaned: 
> Outliers are removed, and obvious instrument or data entry errors are corrected.
>
> Data can be seen as the **smallest units of factual information** 
> that can be used as a basis for calculation, reasoning, or discussion. 
> 
> Data can range from abstract ideas to concrete measurements, including, but not limited to, statistics. 
> 
> Thematically connected data presented in some relevant context can be viewed as **information**. 
> Contextually connected pieces of information can then be described as data **insights or intelligence**. 
> 
> The stock of insights and intelligence that accumulate over time 
> resulting from the synthesis of data into information, can then be described as **knowledge**. 
> 
> Data has been described as "the new oil of the digital economy". 
> Data, as a general concept, refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge 
> is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.
>
> Advances in computing technologies have led to the advent of big data, 
> which usually refers to very large quantities of data, usually at the petabyte scale. 
> 
> Using traditional data analysis methods and computing, 
> working with such large (and growing) datasets is difficult, even impossible. 
> (Theoretically speaking, infinite data would yield infinite information, 
> which would render extracting insights or intelligence impossible.) 
> 
> In response, the relatively new field of data science uses machine learning (and other artificial intelligence) 
> methods that allow for efficient applications of analytic methods to big data.
