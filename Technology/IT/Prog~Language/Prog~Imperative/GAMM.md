> **Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik** ("Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics"), often referred to by the acronym GAMM, is a German society for the promotion of science, founded in 1922 by the physicist Ludwig Prandtl and the mathematician Richard von Mises.  The society awards the Richard von Mises prize annually. The society publishes the journal GAMM-Mitteilungen (Surveys for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) and Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) through Wiley.According to the statutes, GAMM aims "to maintain and promote scientific work and international cooperation in applied mathematics as well as in all sub-areas of mechanics and physics that are part of the fundamentals the engineerings count." The GAMM pursues this goal primarily by organizing scientific conferences. The GAMM's most important event is the annual conference, which takes place annually in Germany or neighboring countries and is attended by hundreds of scientists, primarily because of its scientific program. The proceedings volume (PAMM) is published every year at the conference. In addition, further conferences on specific areas from the spectrum of disciplines represented in the GAMM take place.In 1958 the GAMM and the ACM together worked out the "ALGOL 58 Report" at a meeting in Zurich.
