> Fail fast, also sometimes termed fail fast, fail often or fail cheap, 
> is a business management concept and theory of organizational psychology 
> that argues businesses should encourage employees to use a trial-and-error process 
> to quickly determine and assess the long-term viability of a product or strategy and move on, 
> cutting losses rather than continuing to invest in a doomed approach. 
> 
> It is an element of some organizations' corporate culture, 
> particularly in the technology industry and in the United States' Silicon Valley.  
>
> A key rationale is that a failure is discovered before release or rollout, 
> to prevent larger losses incurred from a failed final product and the resulting loss of reputation and trust. 
>
> The implied promise to employees is that the consequences of failure, if recognized quickly, 
> would not negatively affect a person's position, job or career; 
> a key component of a successful approach 
> requires a corporate culture that not only tolerates but actively encourages 
> and even celebrates failure that results in valuable learning for the organization. 
> 
> It has been criticized for lack of adherence to that implicit promise, 
> for its risk of creating a culture of mediocrity, 
> and for being overoptimistic about the learning benefits of failure.
