# Functional Programming

Pure Functions create Programs without Side-Effects. 
Additionally these __always return the same Result__
given the same Parameters, because the Result depends solely on the Inputs, 
Ambient State is neither referenced nor modified. 

This allows for good Reasoning over a Program 
and prevents unexpected Side-Effects. 

For Code-Evolution Functional Programming needs to also use Interfaces to enable [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.2/Patterns~GRASP/Pattern~Polymorphism|Pattern~Polymorphism]]. 

## New functional Features 

### Immutability and pure Functions 

In contrast to [[Prog~OO]] which tries to avoid Side-Effects by [[Prog~OO/OO~Encapsulation|OO~Encapsulation]] and [[OO-Invariants]], 
Functional Programming avoids Side-Effects by [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.1/Patterns~Fundamental/Pattern~Immutable|Immutability]]. 

Immutable Variables enforce Pure Functions. 
### Strict Type and closed Polymorphism 

In addition to 
- structured Programmings `if ... else ...` or `switch ... case ...` 
- and OO open [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.2/Patterns~GRASP/Pattern~Polymorphism|Pattern~Polymorphism]] 
- strict Typing allows for closed [[Polymorphism]]. 

Closed Polymorphism is usually implemented with Monads like [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.2/Patterns~GRASP/OneOf-Monad|OneOf-Monad]] and [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.2/Patterns~GRASP/Option-Type|Option-Type]]. 
This really forces the Developer to consider all Cases. 
There are no default catch-all Cases and unhandled cases 
can easily be propagated up the Call tree by retaining the Monad. 
### syntactic Sugar

#### Type Inference 

Advances in Compiler Technology allow it to infer the Type of an Expression in many cases. 
This makes the otherwise very Code much more concise. 
ML and F# are examples of this. 
The corresponding C# Code requires declaring the Types 
at least for for Method Signatures' Parameters and Results. 
In concrete implementations this can end up with deeply nested generic Types. 
#### Extension Methods  

Public Properties open up the state of Objects to [[Extension-Method]]s, 
which allows for [[Code-completion]],
a domain that was previously only available to [[Prog~OO/OO-Lang|OO-Languages]]. 

Opening up the Records is a two-edged Sword: 
#has_/Pros :: allows for dynamic and 'intelligent' Programming 
#has_/Pros :: allows to re-use Algorithms across different Hierarchies without [[Prog~OO/Inheritance_by_Class|Inheritance]] or [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.1/Patterns~Fundamental/Pattern~Delegation|Pattern~Delegation]], using only [[../../../../IT/Programming/Patterns/Patterns~Java.1/Patterns~Fundamental/Pattern~Interface|Interface]]s. 
#has_/Cons :: makes Code fragile by relying on sometimes accidental Fields/Properties  

Therefore a conscious Design is still needed on which Properties are added to the public Interface. 
These Interfaces subsequently also allow for robust migration by centralizing Adapter Logic. 
You need to distinguish between essential (public, stable) and accidental (private, volatile) Data.

## Benefits 
### Testing

This makes Testing much more reliable.

### Code-Reviews

The ` => ` Syntax makes Code-Reviews easier for Functions, 
because it allows only for a single Expression, which increases the likelihood of Purity. 

For an Expression to return a Value, 
each Function used in the Expression also must return a Value
(because you can not have void/Methods as Parameters to an Expression).

This creates a high confidence that the Expression is side-effect-free, 
and thus also the Function using this single Expression. 

This does NOT apply to Methods, especially [[Setter]]s; they exist **only** for their Side-Effects. 

### Fluent Apis 

Fluent-Apis can also be functional, 
but only if the construct **new** Objects, instead modifying existing State. 

Seemingly 'fluent' APIs like TextWriter.Append() are not functional, 
because they modify the Writer. 
You should rather use the (more expensive) ImmutableStack for this purpose 
(and eventually revert the order).
