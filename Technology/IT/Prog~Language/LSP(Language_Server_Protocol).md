> The Language Server Protocol (LSP) is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol for use between source code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) and servers that provide "language intelligence tools": programming language-specific features like 
> - code completion, 
> - syntax highlighting and 
> - marking of warnings and errors, as well as 
> - refactoring routines. 
> 
> The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE. In the early 2020s LSP quickly became a "norm" for language intelligence tools providers.
