### Collection-Expressions 

These are much more concise readable. 
When the Type can be inferred, you can 
- replace `new[] { ... }` 
- with `[...]` 
This goes especially well with 2D and 3D Arrays, because you 
- need to specify the Type only once at the Declaration or even skip it when obvious to the Compiler. 
- all Vectors can be written in the same brief Syntax below each other
