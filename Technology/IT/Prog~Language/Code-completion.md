#has_/Pros :: Code-Completion considerably speeds up Programming, 
because all eligible Alternatives are presented in a Dropdown-List. 

This is in stark Contrast to Editors of previous IDEs 
which often required the developer to 
- __constantly refer to Handbooks__ 
- __or memorize__ most of the Constructs and Libraries. 

The latter was possible for simple Languages like [[Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Prog~Pascal|Prog~Pascal]], 
but it becomes completely utopian with today's requirements. 

A first step to increase productivity were [[Help-Files]], 
which could provide for faster Search than Handbooks 
and usually are available Offline. 

But even Internet queries, which have enabled many laypeople to start programming, 
are not as efficient and context-aware as[[../../../../Knowledge/AGI(Artificial_general_Intelligence)/Products~AGI/Github-CoPilot|Github-CoPilot]]].
