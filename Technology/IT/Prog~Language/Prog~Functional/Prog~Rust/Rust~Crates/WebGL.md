> 
> WebGL is fully integrated with other web standards, 
> allowing GPU-accelerated usage of physics, image processing, and effects in the [[HTML~canvas]]. 
> WebGL elements can be mixed with other HTML elements and composited with other parts of the page or page background. 
> 
> WebGL programs consist of 
> - control code written in JavaScript, and 
> - shader code written in OpenGL ES Shading Language (GLSL ES), 
>   a language similar to C or C++. 
> 
> WebGL code is executed on a computer's GPU.
