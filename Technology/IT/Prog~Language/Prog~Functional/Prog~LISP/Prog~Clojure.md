> **Clojure** (, like closure) is a dynamic and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform.
> 
> Like most other Lisps, Clojure's syntax is built on [[S-expressions]] that are first parsed into data structures by a reader before being compiled. 
> 
> Clojure's reader supports literal syntax for maps, sets and vectors along with lists, and these are compiled to the mentioned structures directly. 
> 
> Clojure treats code as data and has a Lisp macro system. 
> 
> Clojure is a Lisp-1 and is not intended to be code-compatible with other dialects of Lisp, since it uses its own set of data structures incompatible with other Lisps.
> 
> Clojure advocates immutability and immutable data structures and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states. 
> 
> This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs is intended to facilitate developing more robust, especially concurrent, programs that are simple and fast. 
> 
> While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of a dependent type system.
> 
> The language was created by Rich Hickey in the mid-2000's, originally for the Java platform; the language has since been ported to other platforms, such as the Common Language Runtime (.NET). 
> 
> Hickey continues to lead development of the language as its [[../BDfL(benevolent_dictator_for_life)]].
