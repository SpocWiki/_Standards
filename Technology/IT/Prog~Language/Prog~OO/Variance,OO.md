Sub-Interface Methods can be variant, i.e. 
- accept __less specific Parameters__ [[#Contravariance]] 
- return __more specific Results__ [[#Covariance]] 

This corresponds directly to the [[../Prog~Principle/Robustness-Principle]], 
implemented e.g. in [[Postel's_Law]], where 
- you should accept __less specific Parameters__ 
- but always return __more specific Results__ 

Consequently 
- __Read-only__ data types (sources with generic __out__-Parameters) can be __covariant__; 
- __write-only__ data types (sinks with generic __in__-Parameters) can be __contravariant__. 
- __Mutable__ data types which act as both sources and sinks are always __invariant__.

## How to achieve Variance

Variance is an important architectural Property. 
It allows to re-use Algorithms, Components and even Instances in broader Type-Sets. 

### Separate Reading and Writing Interfaces 

These Interfaces can separately be passed to generic Algorithm(-Instances) with different Types. 

### Avoid contravariant Methods 

Instead of adding a query-Function with [[Covariance,OO|coVariant]] Parameter (e.g. `GetEdges(TEdge)`), 
you can add a query-Function with (some) invariant Parameter-Parts (e.g. `GetEdges(source, target)`), 
and return a small SubSet that you can test externally.

## [[Prog~Eiffel|Prog~Eiffel]] CoVariance 
The cat shelter illustrates a common phenomenon: 
it is _a kind of_ animal shelter but has _additional restrictions_, 
and it seems reasonable to use inheritance and restricted parameter types to model this. 
In proposing this use of inheritance, the Eiffel designers reject the [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle "Liskov substitution principle"), 
which states that objects of subclasses should always be less restricted than objects of their superclass.

Giuseppe Castagna observed that in a typed language with multiple dispatch, 
a generic function can have some parameters which control dispatch and the other parameters do not. 

Because the method selection rule chooses the most specific applicable method, 
if a method overrides another method, 
then the overriding method will have more specific types for the controlling parameters. 

On the other hand, to ensure type safety the language still must require the left-over parameters to be at least as general. 
Using the previous terminology, types used for runtime method selection are covariant 
while types not used for runtime method selection of the method are contravariant. 

Conventional single-dispatch languages like Java also obey this rule: 
only one argument is used for method selection (the receiver object, passed along to a method as the hidden argument `this`), 
and indeed the type of `this` is more specialized inside overriding methods than in the superclass.

Castagna suggests that examples where covariant parameter types are superior 
(particularly, binary methods) should be handled using [[multiple-dispatch]]; which is naturally covariant. 
However, most programming languages do not support multiple dispatch natively.  

In [[OO-Lang/Prog~Java|Prog~Java]] the type `List<? extends Animal>` acts as an interface type 
containing only the covariant methods of `List<T>`, 
but unlike in C# the implementer of `List<T>` did not have to define it ahead of time.

In a declaration-site language, libraries must either expose less variance, or define more interfaces.
In a call-site language like Java, 

## Origins [[../../../../Knowledge/Math/Category_Theory.internal|Category_Theory.internal]]] 

These terms come from the notion of [covariant and contravariant functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_functors "Covariance and contravariance of functors") in [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"). 
Consider the category 𝐶 whose objects are types 
and whose morphisms represent the subtype relationship ≤. 
(This is an example of how any partially ordered set can be considered as a category.) 

Then for example the function type constructor takes two types _p_ and _r_ 
and creates a new type _p_ → _r_; so it takes objects in 𝐶² to objects in 𝐶. 
By the subtyping rule for function types this operation reverses ≤ for the first parameter and preserves it for the second, 
so it is a contravariant functor in the first parameter and a covariant functor in the second.
