Go was written by plan9 OS Alumni Programmers as a better C Language. 
Similar to [[../../Prog~Functional/Prog~Rust|Prog~Rust]] which should be a better [[../../Prog~Structured/Structured_Prog-Lang/Prog~C]]. 

Both C nor Go are rarely modified 

Instead JS, C#, C++ and  Rust add > 10 Features per year. 

Over time these Languages become very complex and Idioms change. 
You have to be up-to-date. 

> Go is a statically typed, compiled, high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
> 
> It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. 
> 
> It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.
> There are two major implementations:
>
> Google's self-hosting "gc" compiler toolchain, targeting multiple operating systems and WebAssembly.
>
> gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the libgo library. With GCC the combination is gccgo; with LLVM the combination is gollvm.A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
