# [[Structure~Subroutine]] 

AKA Functions, Procedures, Macros 

These are the first, fundamental abstractions that enable [[../Prog~Structured]] . 
## Best Practices: 

### Good Naming 
Name should describe Result and ALL Side-Effects. 

### few Parameters 
Less than 9 is OK, 
Otherwise create Structures and pass these. 

### Local Variables allow Recursion
