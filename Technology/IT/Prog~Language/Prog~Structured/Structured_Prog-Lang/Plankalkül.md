> **Plankalkül** (German pronunciation: [ˈplaːnkalkyːl]) is a programming language designed for engineering purposes by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. It was the first high-level programming language to be designed for a computer.

> Kalkül is the German term for a formal system—as in Hilbert-Kalkül, the original name for the Hilbert-style deduction system—so Plankalkül refers to a formal system for planning.

Most of his computers were destroyed by Allied bombs, but Zuse was able to rescue one machine, the [Z4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z4_(computer) "Z4 (computer)"), and move it to the Alpine village of [Hinterstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinterstein) 
Unable to continue building computers 
– which was also forbidden by the Allied Powers – 
Zuse devoted his time to the development of a higher-level programming model and language.
