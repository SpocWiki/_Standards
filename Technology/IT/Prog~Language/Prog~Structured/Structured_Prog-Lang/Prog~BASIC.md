> [[Dartmouth-BASIC]] is the original version of the BASIC programming language. 
> It was designed by two professors at [[../../../Software/OS(Operating-System)/Dartmouth_College|Dartmouth_College]], [[Kemeny,John_G]] and [[Kurtz,Thomas_E]]. 
> With the underlying [[../../../Software/OS(Operating-System)/DTSS(Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System)]], 
> it offered an interactive programming environment 
> to all undergraduates as well as the larger university community.
>
> Several versions were produced at Dartmouth, 
> implemented by undergraduate students and operating as a compile and go system. 
> The first version ran on 1 May 1964, and it was opened to general users in June. 
> Upgrades followed, culminating in the seventh and final release in 1979. 
> 
> Dartmouth also introduced a dramatically updated version known as 
> Structured BASIC (or SBASIC) in 1975, 
> which added various structured programming concepts. 
> SBASIC formed the basis of the ANSI-standard Standard BASIC efforts 
> in the early 1980s.
>
> Most dialects of BASIC trace their history to the Fourth Edition 
> (which added e.g. string variables, which most BASIC users take for granted, 
> though the original could print strings), 
> but generally leave out more esoteric features like matrix math. 
> 
> In contrast to the Dartmouth compilers, 
> most other BASICs were written as interpreters. 
> This allowed them to run in the limited main memory of early microcomputers. 
> [[Microsoft_BASIC]] is one example, designed to run in only 4 KB of memory. 
> 
> By the early 1980s, tens of millions of home computers 
> were running some variant of the MS interpreter. 
> 
> It became the de facto standard for BASIC, 
> which led to the abandonment of the ANSI SBASIC efforts. 
> 
> Kemeny and Kurtz later formed a company 
> to develop and promote a version of SBASIC known as True BASIC.
>
> Many early mainframe games 
> trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC and the DTSS system. 
> 
> A selection of these were collected, in HP Time-Shared BASIC versions, 
> in the People's Computer Company book [[What to do after you hit Return]]. 
> 
> Many of the original source listings in BASIC Computer Games and related works 
> also trace their history to Dartmouth BASIC.

Kemeny later noted that "Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that."

the system would use time-sharing, a new language would be needed, to get users onto the system new courses would introduce programming as an adjunct to other subjects, and finally, the terminals would be open to all users. 

After several Experiments with Freshment using ALGOL and FORTRAN, they decided to develop a new, better-to-read Language. 

The new language was heavily patterned on FORTRAN II; statements were one-to-a-line, numbers were used to indicate the target of loops and branches, and many of the commands were similar or identical to Fortran. However, the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) "Syntax (programming languages)") was changed wherever it could be improved. For instance, the difficult to remember `DO` loop was replaced by the much easier to remember `FOR I = 1 TO 10 STEP 2`, and the line number used in the DO was instead indicated by the `NEXT I`.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#cite_note-9) Likewise, the cryptic `IF` statement of Fortran, whose syntax matched a particular instruction of the machine on which it was originally written, became the simpler `IF I=5 THEN GOTO 100`. These changes made the language much less idiosyncratic while still having an overall structure and feel similar to the original FORTRAN.
