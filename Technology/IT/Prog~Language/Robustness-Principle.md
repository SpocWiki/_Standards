Among programmers, to produce compatible functions, the principle is also known in the form: 
- be contravariant (more generic) in the input type and 
 - covariant (more specific) in the output type.

This Principle corresponds directly to the [[Liskov_Substitution-Principle]], 
leading to the common [[Prog~OO/Variance,OO]] of Parameters and Results. 

This Principle, while a Staple of Internet Programming, can be exploited 
and lead to the proliferation of accidental functionality.
