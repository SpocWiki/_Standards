## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A **Key** in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters 
> that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, 
> can encode or decode cryptographic data. 
> 
> Based on the used method, the key can be different sizes and varieties, 
> but in all cases, the strength of the encryption relies on the security of the key being maintained. A key's security strength is dependent on its algorithm, the size of the key, the generation of the key, and the process of key exchange.
