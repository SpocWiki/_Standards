## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In computing, a **Database** is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. 
> 
> The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications 
> can be referred to as a database system. 
> Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, 
> the database system or an application associated with the database.
>
> Before digital storage and retrieval of data have become widespread, 
> index cards were used for data storage in a wide range of applications and environments: 
> - in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; 
> - in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; 
> - in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and 
> - in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes in a card file. 
> Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes 
> until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s.
>
> Small databases can be stored on a file system, 
> while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. 
> The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, 
> including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, 
> query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, 
> and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.
>
> Computer scientists may classify database management systems 
> according to the database models that they support. 
> 
> Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. 
> These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, 
> and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. 
> 
> In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, 
> collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.
