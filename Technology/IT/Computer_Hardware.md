## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Computer hardware** includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the 
> - central processing unit (CPU), 
> - random access memory (RAM), 
> - motherboard, 
> - computer data storage, 
> - graphics card, 
> - sound card, and 
> - computer case. 
> It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.
>
> By contrast, software is a set of written  instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. 
> Hardware derived its name from the fact it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, 
> whereas software is soft because it is easy to change.
>
> Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. 
> A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, 
> although other systems exist with only hardware.
