> A computer network is a collection of communicating computers 
> and other devices, such as printers and smart phones. 
>
> Today almost all computers are connected to a computer network, 
> such as the global Internet or an embedded network such as those found in modern cars. 
>
> Many applications have only limited functionality unless they are connected to a computer network. 
> Early computers had very limited connections to other devices, 
> but perhaps the first example of computer networking occurred in 1940 
> when George Stibitz connected a terminal at Dartmouth 
> to his Complex Number Calculator at Bell Labs in New York.
>
> In order to communicate, the computers and devices must be 
> connected by a physical medium that supports transmission of information. 
> A variety of technologies have been developed for the physical medium, 
> including wired media like copper cables and optical fibers and wireless radio-frequency media. 
> 
> The computers may be connected to the media in a variety of network topologies. 
> In order to communicate over the network, computers use agreed-on rules, 
> called communication protocols, over whatever medium is used.
>
> The computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, 
> or other specialized or general-purpose hosts. 
> They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. 
> Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. 
> Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols 
> such as the Internet Protocol.
>
> Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, 
> including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, 
> communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, 
> traffic control mechanisms, and organizational intent.
>
> Computer networks support many applications and services, such as 
> - access to the World Wide Web, 
> - digital video and audio, shared use of 
> - application servers and 
> - storage servers, 
> - printers and fax machines, and 
> - use of email and 
> - instant messaging applications.
