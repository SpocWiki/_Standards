> A **Bed** is a piece of furniture that is used as a place to sleep, rest, and relax.
>
> Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. 
> The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base. 
> 
> Many beds include a box spring inner-sprung base, which is a large mattress-sized box 
> containing wood and springs that provide additional support and suspension for the mattress. 
> 
> Beds are available in many sizes, ranging from infant-sized bassinets and cribs, 
> to small beds for a single person or adult, to large queen 
> and king-size beds designed for two people. 
> 
> While most beds are single mattresses on a fixed frame, there are other varieties, such as 
> - the murphy bed, which folds into a wall, 
> - the sofa bed, which folds out of a sofa, 
> - the trundle bed, which is stored under a low, twin-sized bed 
>   and can be rolled out to create a larger sleeping area, and 
> - the bunk bed, which provides two mattresses on two tiers 
>   as well as a ladder to access the upper tier. 
> 
> Temporary beds include the inflatable air mattress and the folding camp cot. 
> Some beds contain neither a padded mattress nor a bed frame, such as the hammock. 
> Other beds are made specifically for animals.
>
> Beds may have a headboard for resting against, and may have side rails and footboards. 
> "Headboard only" beds may incorporate a "dust ruffle", "bed skirt", 
> or "valance sheet" to hide the bed frame. 
> To support the head, a pillow made of a soft, 
> padded material is usually placed on the top of the mattress. 
> 
> Some form of covering blanket is often used to insulate the sleeper, 
> often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet, collectively referred to as bedding. 
> Bedding is the removable non-furniture portion of a bed, 
> which enables these components to be washed or aired out.
