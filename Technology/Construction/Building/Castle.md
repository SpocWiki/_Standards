> A **Castle** is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages 
> predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. 
> Scholars usually consider a castle to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. 
> 
> This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for pleasance 
> and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified. 
> 
> Use of the term has varied over time and, sometimes, 
> has also been applied to structures such as hill forts 
> and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. 
> 
> Over the Middle Ages, when genuine castles were built, 
> they took on a great many forms with many different features, 
> although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace.
>
> European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire, 
> which resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. 
> These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them 
> and they were both offensive and defensive structures: 
> - they provided a base from which raids could be launched 
> - as well as offering protection from enemies. 
> 
> Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, 
> the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. 
> Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, 
> and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, 
> such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.
>
> Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber 
> but had their defences replaced later by stone. 
> Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits 
> and relying on a central keep. 
> 
> In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. 
> This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire. 
> Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – 
> several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time 
> to maximise the castle's firepower. 
> These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, 
> such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. 
> Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, 
> so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. 
> Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.
>
> Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, 
> it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, 
> when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. 
> While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, 
> new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable 
> and undesirable places to live. 
> 
> As a result, true castles went into a decline and were replaced by artillery star forts 
> with no role in civil administration, and château or country houses that were indefensible. 
> From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles 
> with the construction of mock castles, 
> part of a Romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.
