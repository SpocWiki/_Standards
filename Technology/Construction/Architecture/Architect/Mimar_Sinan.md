> **Mimar Sinan** (Ottoman Turkish: معمار سينان, Turkish: Mimar Sinan, [miːˈmaːɾ siˈnan]; 
> c. 1488/1490 – 17 July 1588) also known as Koca Mi'mâr Sinân Âğâ, 
> ("Sinan Agha the Grand Architect" or "Grand Sinan") 
> was the chief Ottoman architect, engineer and mathematician for sultans Suleiman the Magnificent, 
> Selim II and Murad III. 
> 
> He was responsible for the construction of more than 300 major structures, 
> including the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, the Kanuni Sultan Suleiman Bridge in Büyükçekmece, 
> and the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge in Višegrad, 
> as well as other more modest projects such as madrasa's, külliyes, and bridges. 
> His apprentices would later design the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul 
> and the Stari Most bridge in Mostar.
>
> The son of a stonemason, he received a technical education and became a military engineer. 
> He rose rapidly through the ranks to become first an officer and finally a Janissary commander, 
> with the honorific title of Sinan. 
> 
> He refined his architectural and engineering skills while on campaign with the Janissaries, 
> becoming expert at constructing fortifications of all kinds, 
> as well as military infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges and aqueducts. 
> At about the age of fifty, he was appointed as chief royal architect, 
> applying the technical skills he had acquired in the army 
> to the "creation of fine religious buildings" and civic structures of all kinds. 
> He remained in this post for almost fifty years.
>
> His masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, 
> although his most famous work is the Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul. 
> 
> He headed an extensive governmental department 
> and trained many assistants who, in turn, distinguished themselves; these include 
> - Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, architect of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque and 
> - Mimar Hayruddin, architect of the Stari Most. 
> 
> He is considered the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture 
> and has been compared to Michelangelo, his contemporary in the West. 
> Michelangelo and his plans for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome were well known in Istanbul, 
> since Leonardo da Vinci and he had been invited, in 1502 and 1505 respectively, 
> by the Sublime Porte to submit plans for a bridge spanning the Golden Horn. 
> Mimar Sinan's works are among the most influential buildings in history.
