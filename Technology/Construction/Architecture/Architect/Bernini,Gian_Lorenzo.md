> Gian Lorenzo (or Gianlorenzo) Bernini (UK: , US: ; Italian: [ˈdʒan loˈrɛntso berˈniːni]; 
> Italian Giovanni Lorenzo; 7 December 1598 – 28 November 1680) was an Italian sculptor and architect. 
> 
> While a major figure in the world of architecture, 
> he was more prominently the leading sculptor of his age, 
> credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture.
>
> As one scholar has commented, "What Shakespeare is to drama, Bernini may be to sculpture: 
> the first pan-European sculptor 
> whose name is instantaneously identifiable with a particular manner and vision, 
> and whose influence was inordinately powerful ..." 
> 
> In addition, he was a painter (mostly small canvases in oil) and a man of the theatre: 
> he wrote, directed and acted in plays (mostly Carnival satires), 
> for which he designed stage sets and theatrical machinery. 
> He produced designs as well for a wide variety of decorative art objects 
> including lamps, tables, mirrors, and even coaches.
>
> As an architect and city planner, he designed secular buildings, churches, chapels, and public squares, 
> as well as massive works combining both architecture and sculpture, 
> especially elaborate public fountains and funerary monuments 
> and a whole series of temporary structures (in stucco and wood) for funerals and festivals. 
> 
> His broad technical versatility, boundless compositional inventiveness 
> and sheer skill in manipulating marble ensured 
> that he would be considered a worthy successor of Michelangelo, 
> far outshining other sculptors of his generation. 
> 
> His talent extended beyond the confines of sculpture 
> to a consideration of the setting in which it would be situated; 
> his ability to synthesize sculpture, painting, and architecture into a coherent conceptual and visual whole 
> has been termed by the late art historian Irving Lavin the "unity of the visual arts".
