## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> An architectural style is a classification of buildings (and nonbuilding structures) 
> based on a set of characteristics and features, including 
> - overall appearance, 
> - arrangement of the components, 
> - method of construction, 
> - building materials used, 
> - form, 
> - size, 
> - structural design, and 
> - regional character.
>
> Architectural styles are frequently associated with a 
> - historical epoch (Renaissance style), 
> - geographical location (Italian Villa style), 
> - or an earlier architectural style (Neo-Gothic style), 
> and are influenced by the corresponding broader artistic style and the "general human condition". 
> 
> Heinrich Wölfflin even declared an analogy between a building and a costume: 
> an "architectural style reflects the attitude and the movement of people in the period concerned".
>
> The 21st century construction uses a multitude of styles 
> that are sometimes lumped together as a "contemporary architecture" 
> based on the common trait of extreme reliance on computer-aided architectural design (cf. Parametricism).
>
> Folk architecture (also "vernacular architecture") is not a style, 
> but an application of local customs to small-scale construction without clear identity of the builder.
