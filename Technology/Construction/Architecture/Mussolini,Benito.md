> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian dictator 
> who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). 
> He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, 
> as well as Duce of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 
> until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. 
> 
> As dictator of Italy and one of the principal founders of fascism, 
> Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements 
> during the inter-war period.
>
> Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. 
> In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), 
> but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, 
> in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. 
> 
> In 1914, Mussolini founded a newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, 
> and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. 
> 
> Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, 
> and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, 
> instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. 
> 
> On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), 
> Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, 
> becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. 
> After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labour strikes, 
> Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws 
> that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. 
> Within five years, Mussolini established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means 
> and aspired to create a totalitarian state. 
> In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.
>
> Mussolini's foreign policy was based on the fascist doctrine of "Spazio vitale" ()"living space"); 
> which aimed to expand Italian possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. 
> In 1923, Mussolini ordered the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece. 
> That same year, Mussolini launched the Second Italo-Senussi war which lasted until 1932 
> and culminated in the Libyan genocide. 
> He also annexed the city of Fiume into Italy after the Treaty of Rome in 1924 with Yugoslavia. 
> Through the Tirana treaties, Mussolini turned Albania into an Italian protectorate. 
> In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War 
> and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. 
> 
> In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 
> 1939, Mussolini ordered an intervention in Spain in favour of Francisco Franco 
> during the Spanish Civil War. 
> 
> At the same time, Mussolini initially tried to retain much of the Versailles status quo 
> by sending troops to the Brenner Pass to delay Hitler's Anschluss, and taking part in 
> the Treaty of Lausanne, the Lytton Report, the Four-Power Pact and the Stresa Front. 
> 
> However, he ultimately alienated the democratic powers 
> as tensions grew in the League of Nations, which he left in 1937. 
> Now hostile to France and Britain, Italy formed the Axis alliance with Nazi Germany 
> and Imperial Japan.
>
> The wars of the 1930s, although victorious, had cost Italy enormous resources, 
> leaving the country unprepared for the upcoming Second World War. 
> Therefore, when Poland was invaded on 1 September 1939, 
> Mussolini declared Italy's non-belligerence. 
> However, on 10 June 1940, believing that Allied defeat was imminent, 
> he decided to join the war on the side of Germany to share the potential spoils of victory. 
> But after three more years of world war, the tide of the conflict turned in favour of the Allies. 
> 
> Following the invasion of Sicily and a motion of no confidence by the Grand Council of Fascism, 
> King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini as head of government 
> and placed him in custody (25 July 1943). 
> After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 
> Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid 
> by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos. 
> After meeting with his fallen ally, Hitler made Mussolini the figurehead of 
> a puppet state in German-occupied northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Salò Republic), 
> which served as a collaborationist regime of the Germans in their fight against the Allies, 
> now including the Kingdom of Italy, and the Italian resistance.
>
> In late April 1945, with Allied victory imminent, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci 
> attempted to flee to Switzerland, but they were captured by Italian communist partisans 
> and summarily executed on 28 April near Lake Como, 
> and their bodies were strung up by the heels outside a service station in Milan.
