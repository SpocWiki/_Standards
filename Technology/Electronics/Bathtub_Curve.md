## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Bathtub curve** is a particular shape of a failure rate graph. 
> This graph is used in reliability engineering and deterioration modeling. 
> 
> The 'bathtub' refers to the shape of a line that curves up at both ends, 
> similar in shape to a bathtub. The bathtub curve has 3 regions:
> 1. The first region has a decreasing failure rate due to early failures.
> 2. The middle region is a constant failure rate due to random failures.
> 3. The last region is an increasing failure rate due to wear-out failures.
>
> Not all products exhibit a bathtub curve failure rate. 
> 
> A product is said to follow the bathtub curve if 
> in the early life of a product, the failure rate decreases 
> as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources of potential failure 
> such as manufacturing defects or damage during transit are detected. 
> 
> In the mid-life of a product the failure rate is constant. 
> 
> In the later life of the product, the failure rate increases due to wearout. 
> 
> Many electronic consumer product life cycles follow the bathtub curve. 
> It is difficult to know where a product is along the bathtub curve, 
> or even if the bathtub curve is applicable to a certain product 
> without large amounts of products in use and associated failure rate data.
>
> If products are retired early or have decreased usage near their end of life, 
> the product may show fewer failures per unit calendar time 
> (but not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve predicts.
>
> In reliability engineering, the cumulative distribution function corresponding to a bathtub curve 
> may be analysed using a Weibull chart or in a reliability contour map.
