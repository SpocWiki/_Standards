## History

While the [memristor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor "Memristor") is defined in terms of a two-terminal circuit element, there was an implementation of a three-terminal device called a _memistor_ developed by [Bernard Widrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Widrow "Bernard Widrow") in 1960. 
Memistors formed basic components of a neural network architecture called [ADALINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE "ADALINE") developed by Widrow.
The memistor was also used in [MADALINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE#MADALINE "ADALINE"). 

As the sign function is non-differentiable, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation "Backpropagation") cannot be used to train MADALINE networks. 
Hence, three different training algorithms have been suggested, called Rule I, Rule II and Rule III.
