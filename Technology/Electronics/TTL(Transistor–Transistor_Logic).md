TTL operates at 5V and at rest consumes substantially 
more power than equivalent [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS "CMOS") devices operating at e.g. 3.4V, 
but power consumption does not increase with clock speed as rapidly as for CMOS devices 
TTL is less sensitive to damage from [electrostatic discharge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge "Electrostatic discharge") than early CMOS devices.

> Transistor–transistor logic is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). 
> Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first "transistor") 
> and the amplifying function (the second "transistor"), 
> as opposed to earlier resistor–transistor logic (RTL) and diode–transistor logic (DTL).
>
> TTL integrated circuits (ICs) were widely used in applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, consumer electronics, and synthesizers.
>
> After their introduction in integrated circuit form in 1963 by Sylvania Electric Products, 
> TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies.  
> The 7400 series by Texas Instruments became particularly popular. 
> 
> TTL manufacturers offered a wide range of logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and other circuits. 
> 
> Variations of the original TTL circuit design offered higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. 
> 
> TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic dual in-line package(s) and in flat-pack form. 
> 
> Some TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount technology packages.
>
> TTL became the foundation of computers and other digital electronics. 
> 
> Even after Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) CMOS integrated circuit microprocessors made multiple-chip processors obsolete, 
> TTL devices still found extensive use as glue logic interfacing between more densely integrated components.
