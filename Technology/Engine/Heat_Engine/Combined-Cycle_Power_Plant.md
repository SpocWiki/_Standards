> A **Combined cycle power plant** is an assembly of heat engines 
> that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into mechanical energy. 
> 
> On land, when used to make electricity 
> the most common type is called a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, 
> which is a kind of gas-fired power plant. 
> The same principle is also used for marine propulsion, 
> where it is called a combined gas and steam (COGAS) plant. 
> Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles improves overall efficiency, 
> which reduces fuel costs.
>
> The principle is that after completing its cycle in the first (usually gas turbine) engine, 
> the working fluid (the exhaust) is still hot enough 
> that a second **subsequent heat engine can extract energy from the heat in the exhaust**. 
> Usually the heat passes through a heat exchanger 
> so that the two engines can use different working fluids.
>
> By generating power from multiple streams of work, 
> the overall efficiency can be increased by 50–60%. 
> That is, from an overall efficiency of say 43% for a simple cycle with the turbine alone, 
> to as much as 64% net with the full combined cycle running.
>
> Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles can also be used, 
> but CCGT plants have advantages for both electricity generation and marine power. 
> The gas turbine cycle can often start very quickly, which gives immediate power. 
> This avoids the need for separate expensive peaker plants, or lets a ship maneuver. 
> Over time the secondary steam cycle will warm up, 
> improving fuel efficiency and providing further power.
>
> In November 2013, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE assessed 
> the levelised cost of energy for newly built power plants in the German electricity sector. 
> They gave costs of between 78 and €100 /MWh for CCGT plants powered by natural gas. 
> In addition the capital costs of combined cycle power is relatively low, at around $1000/kW, 
> making it one of the cheapest types of generation to install.
