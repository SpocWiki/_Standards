External combustion (like Stirling engines) can potentially achieve higher theoretical efficiencies 
since the **temperature of combustion and working fluid can be separated** â€” 
but materials, heat transfer rates, and engineering limitations prevent this from being realized in practice.

> An external combustion engine (EC engine) is a reciprocating heat engine 
> where a working fluid, contained internally, is heated by combustion in an external source, 
> through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. 
> 
> The fluid then, by expanding and acting on the mechanism of the engine, 
> produces motion and usable work. 
> The fluid is then dumped (open cycle), or cooled, compressed and reused (closed cycle). 
>
> In these types of engines, the combustion is primarily used as a heat source, 
> and the engine can work equally well with **any type of heat source**.
