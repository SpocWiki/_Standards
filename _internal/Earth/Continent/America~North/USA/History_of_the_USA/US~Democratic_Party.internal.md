## Population-Dynamics and Forecasts

The Democrats thought to eventually win over the USA, 
because young people became more liberal and old people died out. 

in 2024 the Republicans think to take over the USA, 
because they get more children who would also become republican. 


## US History is important 

The USA are the most powerful and rich country. 
They have a unique large and homogeneous Market, a rich Agriculture around the Mississippi Stream and cannot be attacked except from Space. 
Their military expenditures allow them to project power across the globe. 
Therefore what happens there, matters, as soon as they turn outward. 

Democratically elected Parties must not be democratic. 
They can (easily) turn over Democracy like Hitler and Trump did.
