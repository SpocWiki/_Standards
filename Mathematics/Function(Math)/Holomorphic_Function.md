# [[Holomorphic_Function]]

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a holomorphic function is a complex-valued function 
> of one or more complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighbourhood of 
> each point in a domain in complex coordinate space C^n⁠
>
> ⁠The existence of a complex derivative in a neighbourhood is a very strong condition: 
> It implies that a holomorphic function is infinitely differentiable 
> and locally equal to its own Taylor series (is analytic). 
> Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.
>
> Though the term analytic function is often used interchangeably with "holomorphic function", the word "analytic" is defined in a broader sense to denote any function (real, complex, or of more general type) that can be written as a convergent power series in a neighbourhood of each point in its domain. That all holomorphic functions are complex analytic functions, and vice versa, is a major theorem in complex analysis.
>
> Holomorphic functions are also sometimes referred to as regular functions. A holomorphic function whose domain is the whole complex plane is called an entire function. The phrase "holomorphic at a point z0" means not just differentiable at ⁠z0⁠, 
> but differentiable everywhere within some close neighbourhood of ⁠z0⁠ in the complex plane.
