> In mathematics, **Exponentiation**, denoted b^n, is an operation involving two numbers: 
> the base, b, and the exponent or power, n. 
> 
> When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to 
> repeated multiplication of the base: that is, bn is the product of multiplying n bases:
> b^n = b × b × ⋯ × b (n times)
> In particular, b^1 = b and b^0 = 1 
>
> The exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base as b^n 
> or in computer code as b^n. 
> This binary operation is often read as "b to the power n"; 
> it may also be referred to as "b raised to the nth power", "the nth power of b", 
> or, most briefly, "b to the n".
>
> The above definition of 
>  immediately implies several properties, in particular the multiplication rule:
> b^n × b^m = b^(n + m) 
>
> That is, when multiplying a base raised to one power times the same base raised to another power, the powers add. 
> 
> Extending this rule to the power zero gives 
> , and, where b is non-zero, dividing both sides by 
>  gives 
> . That is the multiplication rule implies the definition 
>
> A similar argument implies the definition for negative integer powers: 
>b^{-n} = 1/ b^n 
>
> . Dividing both sides by 
>  gives 
>     {\displaystyle b^{n/m}={\sqrt[{m}]{b^{n}}}.}
>
> For example, 
>     {\displaystyle b^{1/2}\times b^{1/2}=b^{1/2\,+\,1/2}=b^{1}=b}
> , meaning 
>     {\displaystyle (b^{1/2})^{2}=b}
>
> , which is the definition of square root: 
>     {\displaystyle b^{1/2}={\sqrt {b}}}
>
> The definition of exponentiation can be extended in a natural way (preserving the multiplication rule) to define b^x 
>  for any positive real base b 
>  and any real number exponent x 
>   
>
> More involved definitions allow complex base and exponent, 
> as well as certain types of matrices as base or exponent.
>
> Exponentiation is used extensively in many fields, including 
> economics, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, 
> with applications such as compound interest, population growth, chemical reaction kinetics, wave behavior, and public-key cryptography.
