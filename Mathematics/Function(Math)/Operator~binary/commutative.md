## Commutativity => canonical Order 

Commutative Operators allow re-ordering the original Expression-(Tree-)Structure into a sorted List. 
This allows faster searching and Comparison!

## Non-Commutativity => linear or Tree-Structure 

## Non-commutative Operators

### Anti-commutative Operators 

#### Cross Product a × b = - b × a



## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a binary operation is commutative 
> if swapping the order of the operands does not change the result. 
> 
> It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. 
> Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic, e.g. "3 + 4 = 4 + 3" or "2 × 5 = 5 × 2", 
> the property can also be used in more advanced settings. 
> 
> The name is needed because there are operations, such as division and subtraction, 
> that do not have it (for example, "3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3"); such operations are not commutative, 
> and so are referred to as noncommutative operations. 
> 
> The idea that simple operations, such as the multiplication and addition of numbers, are commutative 
> was for many years implicitly assumed. 
> Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, 
> when mathematics started to become formalized.
>  
>  A similar property exists for binary relations; a binary relation is said to be __symmetric__ 
>  if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; 
>  for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal 
>  regardless of their order.
