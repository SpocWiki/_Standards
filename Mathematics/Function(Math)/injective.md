> In mathematics, an **injective** function (also known as injection, or one-to-one function )  
> is a function f that maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements; 
> that is, x1 ≠ x2 implies f(x1) ≠ f(x2). 
> (Equivalently, f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2 in the equivalent contrapositive statement.) 
> 
> In other words, every element of the function's codomain 
> is the image of __at most one__ element of its domain. 
> The term one-to-one function must not be confused with one-to-one correspondence 
> that refers to bijective functions which are functions such that __each__ element in the codomain 
> is an image of exactly one element in the domain. 
>
> A homomorphism between algebraic structures 
> is a function that is compatible with the operations of the structures. 
> 
> For all common algebraic structures, and, in particular for vector spaces, 
> an injective homomorphism is also called a monomorphism. 
> 
> However, in the more general context of category theory, 
> the definition of a monomorphism differs from that of an injective homomorphism. 
> This is thus a theorem that they are equivalent for algebraic structures; 
> see Homomorphism § Monomorphism for more details.
