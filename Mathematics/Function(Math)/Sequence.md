## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a **Sequence** is an enumerated collection of objects 
> in which repetitions are allowed and order matters. 
> 
> Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). 
> The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. 
> Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, 
> and unlike a set, the order does matter. 
> 
> Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function from natural numbers 
> (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. 
> The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an indexed family, 
> defined as a function from an arbitrary index set.
>
> For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter "M" first and "Y" last. 
> This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). 
> Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, 
> is a valid sequence. 
> Sequences can be finite, as in these examples, 
> or infinite, such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...).
>
> The position of an element in a sequence is its rank or index; 
> it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. In mathematical analysis, a sequence is often denoted by letters in the form of a_n, b_n and c_n, where the subscript n 
> refers to the nth element of the sequence; 
> for example, the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence F
>  is generally denoted as F_n 
>
> In computing and computer science, finite sequences are usually called strings, words or lists, 
> with the specific technical term chosen 
> depending on the type of object the sequence enumerates 
> and the different ways to represent the sequence in computer memory. 
> Infinite sequences are called streams or Enumerations.
>
> The empty sequence is included in most notions of sequence. 
> It may be excluded depending on the context.
