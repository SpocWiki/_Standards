> In mathematics, the composition operator ∘ takes two functions, f and g 
> and returns a new function h(x):=(g ∘ f)(x)=g(f(x)) 
>
> Thus, the function g is applied after applying f to x. 
> g ∘ f is pronounced "the composition of g and f".
>
> Reverse composition applies the operation in the opposite order, 
> applying f first and g second. 
> 
> Intuitively, reverse composition is a chaining process 
> in which the output of function f feeds the input of function g.
>
> The composition of functions is a special case of the composition of relations, 
> sometimes also denoted by ∘
>
> As a result, all properties of composition of relations are true of composition of functions, 
> such as associativity.
