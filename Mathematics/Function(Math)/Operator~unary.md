> An unary operation is an operation with only one operand, i.e. a single input. 
> It is also an unary homogenous Function, i.e. it maps to its Domain. 
> 
> This is in contrast to general unary Functions 
> and to binary operations, which use two operands. 
> 
> An example is any function ⁠f : A → A⁠ is a unary operation on A.
>
> Common notations are 
> - prefix notation (e.g. ¬, −), 
> - postfix notation (e.g. factorial n!), also in Programming, 
> - functional notation (e.g. sin x or sin(x)), and 
> - superscripts (e.g. transpose AT). 
> 
> Other notations exist as well, for example, in the case of the square root, 
> a horizontal bar extending the square root sign over the argument 
> can indicate the extent of the argument.
