## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a **surjective** function (also known as surjection, or `onto` function ) 
> is a function f such that, __for every element y__ of the function's co-domain, 
> there exists __at least one element x__ in the function's domain such that f(x) = y. 
> In other words, for a function f : X → Y, the co-domain Y is the image of the function's domain X. 
> It is not required that x be unique; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y.
>
> The term surjective and the related terms [[injective]] and [[bijective]] were introduced by Nicolas [[Bourbaki]], 
> a group of mainly French 20th-century mathematicians who, under this pseudonym, 
> wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, 
> beginning in 1935. 
> 
> The French word `sur` means over or above, 
> and relates to the fact that the image of the domain of a surjective function 
> completely covers the function's codomain.
>
> - Any __function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain__ to the image of its domain. 
> - Every surjective function has a right inverse assuming the axiom of choice, 
> - and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. 
> - The composition of surjective functions is always surjective. 
> - Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.
