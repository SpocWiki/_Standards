# [[Operator~binary]] 

#is_a_ :: [[Function~binary]] 

op: D x D => D  is a ternary homogenous Relation or a **binary Function in D**.
Binary Operators allow for a convenient infix Notation:  op(a, b) = a op b

> In mathematics, a binary operation or dyadic operation is a rule for 
> combining two elements (called operands) to produce another element. 
> More formally, a binary operation is an operation of arity two.
>
> More specifically, a binary operation on a set is a binary function 
> that maps every pair of elements of the set to an element of the set. 
> 
> Examples include the familiar arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, set operations like union, complement, intersection. 
> 
> Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as 
> - vector addition, 
> - matrix multiplication, and 
> - conjugation in groups.
>
> A binary function that involves different sets is sometimes also called a binary operation. 
> For example, 
> - scalar multiplication of vector spaces takes a scalar and a vector to produce a vector, 
> - and scalar product takes two vectors to produce a scalar.
>
> Binary operations are the keystone of most structures that are studied in algebra, 
> in particular in semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces.
