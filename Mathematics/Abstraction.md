> **Abstraction** is a process where general rules and concepts are 
> derived from the use and classifying of specific examples, 
> literal (real or concrete) signifiers, first principles, or other methods.
>
> "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process — a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.
>
> Conceptual abstractions may be made by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, selecting only those aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball. In a type–token distinction, a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').
>
> Abstraction in its secondary use is a material process, discussed in the themes below.
