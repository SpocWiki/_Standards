> Georg Friedrich **Bernhard Riemann** (German: [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈbɛʁnhaʁt ˈʁiːman] ; 
> 17 September 1826 – 20 July 1866) was a German mathematician 
> who made profound contributions to analysis, number theory, and differential geometry. 
> In the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the 
> first rigorous formulation of the integral, the Riemann integral, and his work on Fourier series. 
> His contributions to complex analysis include most notably the 
> introduction of Riemann surfaces, breaking new ground 
> in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. 
> 
> His 1859 paper on the prime-counting function, 
> containing the original statement of the Riemann hypothesis, 
> is regarded as a foundational paper of analytic number theory. 
> 
> Through his pioneering contributions to differential geometry, 
> Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of general relativity. 
> He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.
