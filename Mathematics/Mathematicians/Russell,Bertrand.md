> Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell,  (18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) 
> was a British mathematician, logician, philosopher, and public intellectual. 
> He had influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, and various areas of analytic philosophy.
>
> He was one of the early 20th century's prominent logicians and a founder of analytic philosophy, 
> along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, his friend and colleague G. E. Moore, 
> and his student and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
> Russell with Moore led the British "revolt against idealism". 
> Together with his former teacher A. N. Whitehead, Russell wrote Principia Mathematica, 
> a milestone in the development of classical logic 
> and a major attempt to reduce the whole of mathematics to logic (see Logicism). 
> Russell's article "On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy".
>
> Russell was a pacifist who championed anti-imperialism and chaired the India League.  
> He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I, 
> and initially supported appeasement against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, 
> before changing his view in 1943, describing war as a necessary "lesser of two evils". 
> In the wake of World War II, he welcomed American global hegemony 
> in preference to either Soviet hegemony or no (or ineffective) world leadership, 
> even if it were to come at the cost of using their nuclear weapons. 
> 
> He would later criticise Stalinist totalitarianism, 
> condemn the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, 
> and become an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.
>
> In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature 
> "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals 
> and freedom of thought". 
> He was also the recipient of the De Morgan Medal (1932), 
> Sylvester Medal (1934), Kalinga Prize (1957), and Jerusalem Prize (1963).
