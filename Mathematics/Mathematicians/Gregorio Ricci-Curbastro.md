> **Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro** (Italian: [ɡreˈɡɔːrjo ˈrittʃi kurˈbastro]; 
> 12 January 1853 – 6 August 1925) was an Italian mathematician. 
> He is most famous as the discoverer of tensor calculus.
>
> With his former student Tullio Levi-Civita, he wrote his most famous single publication, 
> a pioneering work on the calculus of tensors, signing it as Gregorio Ricci. 
> This appears to be the only time that Ricci-Curbastro 
> used the shortened form of his name in a publication, and continues to cause confusion.
>
> Ricci-Curbastro also published important works in other fields, 
> including a book on higher algebra and infinitesimal analysis, 
> and papers on the theory of real numbers, 
> an area in which he extended the research begun by [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Dedekind,Richard]].
