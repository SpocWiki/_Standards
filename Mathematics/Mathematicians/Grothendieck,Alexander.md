> **Alexander Grothendieck** (; German pronunciation: [ˌalɛˈksandɐ ˈɡʁoːtn̩ˌdiːk] ; French: [ɡʁɔtɛndik]; 
> 28 March 1928 – 13 November 2014) was a German-born mathematician 
> who became the __leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry__. 
> His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of commutative algebra, 
> homological algebra, sheaf theory, and category theory to its foundations, 
> while his so-called "relative" perspective 
> led to revolutionary advances in many areas of pure mathematics. 
> He is __considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century__.
>
> Grothendieck began his productive and public career as a mathematician in 1949. 
> In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the Institut des hautes études scientifiques (IHÉS) 
> and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, 
> he left following a dispute over military funding. 
> 
> He received the Fields Medal in 1966 for advances in algebraic geometry, homological algebra, 
> and K-theory. 
> 
> He later became professor at the University of Montpellier and, 
> while still producing relevant mathematical work, he withdrew from the mathematical community 
> and devoted himself to political and religious pursuits 
> (first Buddhism and later, a more Catholic Christian vision). 
> In 1991, he moved to the French village of Lasserre in the Pyrenees, where he lived in seclusion, 
> still working on mathematics and his philosophical and religious thoughts until his death in 2014.
