> **Alfred North Whitehead**  (15 February 1861 – 30 December 1947) 
> was an English mathematician and philosopher. 
> He created the philosophical school known as process philosophy, 
> which has been applied in a wide variety of disciplines, 
> including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology.
>
> In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. 
> He wrote the three-volume [[Principia_Mathematica]] (1910–1913), 
> with his former student [[Russell,Bertrand|Bertrand Russell]]. 
> 
> Principia Mathematica is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and 
> placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century 
> by [[../../../Knowledge/Literature/Publishers/Modern_Library]].
>
> Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, 
> Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, 
> and finally to metaphysics. 
> 
> He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system 
> which radically departed from most of Western philosophy. 
> 
> Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, 
> and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, 
> thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter 
> that exist independently of one another. 
> Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – 
> are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.
>
> Whitehead's process philosophy argues that "there is urgency in coming to see the world 
> as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, 
> so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us." 
> For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years 
> has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb.
