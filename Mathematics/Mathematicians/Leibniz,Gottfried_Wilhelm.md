> **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1 July 1646 [O.S. 21 June] – 14 November 1716) 
> was a German polymath active as a mathematician, philosopher, scientist and diplomat 
> who invented calculus in addition to many other branches of mathematics and statistics. 
> 
> Leibniz has been called the "last universal genius" 
> due to his knowledge and skills in different fields and 
> because such people became less common during the Industrial Revolution 
> and spread of specialized labor after his lifetime. 
> 
> He is a prominent figure in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. 
> 
> He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history, philology, games, music, 
> and other studies. 
> 
> Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology, 
> and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, biology, 
> medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics and computer science. 
> 
> In addition, he contributed to the field of library science by devising a cataloguing system 
> whilst working at the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany, 
> that would have served as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries. 
> 
> Leibniz's contributions to a wide range of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, 
> in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. 
> He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German.
>
> As a philosopher, he was a leading representative of 17th-century rationalism and idealism. 
> As a mathematician, his major achievement was the development of the main ideas of 
> differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's developments. 
> Mathematicians have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional 
> and more exact expression of calculus.
>
> In the 20th century, Leibniz's notions of the law of continuity 
> and transcendental law of homogeneity found a consistent mathematical formulation 
> by means of non-standard analysis. 
> 
> He was also a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. 
> While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, 
> he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, 
> later used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. 
>
> In philosophy and theology, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion 
> that our world is, in a qualified sense, the best possible world that God could have created, 
> a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as Voltaire in his satirical novella Candide. 
> 
> Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was 
> one of the three influential early modern rationalists. 
> 
> His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, 
> notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved 
> by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. 
> 
> The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic 
> and still influences contemporary analytic philosophy, 
> such as its adopted use of the term "possible world" to define modal notions.
