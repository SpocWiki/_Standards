> Kurt Friedrich Gödel ( GUR-dəl, German: [kʊʁt ˈɡøːdl̩] ; April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) 
> was a  logician, mathematician, and philosopher. 
> Considered along wit[[../../bio/People/Philosophers/Ancient_Philosophers/Aristotle]]]] and [[../../../Knowledge/AGI(Artificial_general_Intelligence)/Concepts~AGI/Frege,Gottlob|Gottlob Frege]] 
> to be one of the most significant logicians in history, 
> Gödel profoundly influenced scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century 
> (at a time when [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Russell,Bertrand|Bertrand Russell]], [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Whitehead,Alfred_North|Alfred North Whitehead]], 
> and [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Hilbert,David]] were using logic and set theory to investigate the[[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Dedekind,Richard| foundations of ]]mathematics), 
> building on earlier work by Frege, [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Dedekind,Richard|Richard Dedekind]], and [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematicians/Cantor,Georg]].
>
> Gödel's discoveries in the foundations of mathematics led to the 
> proof of his completeness theorem in 1929 as part of his dissertation 
> to earn a doctorate at the University of Vienna, 
> and the publication of Gödel's incompleteness theorems two years later, in 1931. 
> 
> The first incompleteness theorem states that for any ω-consistent recursive axiomatic system 
> powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example, Peano arithmetic), 
> there are true propositions about the natural numbers 
> that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms. 
> 
> To prove this, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, 
> which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. 
> The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, 
> states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.
>
> Gödel also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis 
> can be disproved from the accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, 
> assuming that its axioms are consistent. 
> 
> The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. 
> He also made important contributions to proof theory 
> by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.
