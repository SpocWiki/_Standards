> Jules **Henri Poincaré** (UK: , US: ; French: [ɑ̃ʁi pwɛ̃kaʁe] ; 29 April 1854 – 17 July 1912) 
> was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. 
> He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as "The Last Universalist", 
> since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime. 
> Due to his scientific success, influence and his discoveries, 
> he has been deemed "the philosopher par excellence of modern science."
>
> As a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions 
> to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. 
> In his research on the three-body problem, 
> Poincaré became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system 
> which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. 
> He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.
>
> Poincaré made clear the importance of paying attention to 
> the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, 
> and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. 
> Poincaré discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations 
> and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. 
> Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, 
> an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. 
> 
> In 1905, Poincaré first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) 
> emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light 
> as being required by the Lorentz transformations. 
> 
> In 1912, he wrote an influential paper 
> which provided a mathematical argument for quantum mechanics.
>
> The [[Poincaré group]] used in physics and mathematics was named after him.
>
> Early in the 20th century he formulated the Poincaré conjecture, 
> which became, over time, one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics. 
> It was solved in 2002–2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]].
