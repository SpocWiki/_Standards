> **David Hilbert**  (; German: [ˈdaːvɪt ˈhɪlbɐt]; 23 January 1862 – 14 February 1943) 
> was a German mathematician 
> and one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
> 
> Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas including invariant theory, 
> the calculus of variations, commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, 
> the foundations of geometry, spectral theory of operators and its application to integral equations, 
> mathematical physics, and the foundations of mathematics (particularly proof theory).
>
> Hilbert adopted and defended [[Cantor,Georg]]'s set theory and transfinite numbers. 
> In 1900, he presented a collection of problems 
> that set a course for mathematical research of the 20th century.
>
> Hilbert and his students contributed to establishing rigor 
> and developed important tools used in modern mathematical physics. 
> Hilbert was one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic.
