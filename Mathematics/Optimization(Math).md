> Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming 
> is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criteria, from some set of available alternatives. 
> 
> It is generally divided into two subfields: discrete optimization and continuous optimization. 
> Optimization problems arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.
>
> In the more general approach, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics.
