> Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. 
> It has applications in many fields of social science, 
> and is used extensively in economics, logic, systems science and computer science. 
> 
> Initially, game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, 
> in which a participant's gains or losses 
> are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. 
> In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, 
> and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations. 
> 
> It is now an umbrella term for 
> the science of rational decision making in humans, animals, and computers.
>
> Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games 
> and its proof by John von Neumann. 
> Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem 
> on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, 
> which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. 
> 
> His paper was followed by Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944), 
> co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. 
> The second edition provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, 
> which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.
>
> Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s, 
> and was explicitly applied to evolution in the 1970s, 
> although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. 
> 
> Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. 
> John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize 
> for his application of evolutionary game theory in 1999, 
> and fifteen game theorists have won the Nobel Prize in economics as of 2020, 
> including most recently Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson.
