> In mathematics, a dynamical system is a system 
> in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in an ambient space, 
> such as in a parametric curve. 
> 
> Examples include the mathematical models that describe 
> - the swinging of a clock pendulum, 
> - the flow of water in a pipe, 
> - the random motion of particles in the air, and 
> - the number of fish each springtime in a lake. 
> 
> The most general definition unifies several concepts in mathematics 
> such as ordinary differential equations and ergodic theory 
> by allowing different choices of the space and how time is measured. 
> 
> Time can be measured by integers, by real or complex numbers or can be a more general algebraic object, 
> losing the memory of its physical origin, 
> and the space may be a manifold or simply a set, 
> without the need of a smooth space-time structure defined on it.
>
> At any given time, a dynamical system has a state representing a point in an appropriate state space. 
> This state is often given by a tuple of real numbers or by a vector in a geometrical manifold. 
> 
> The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a function that 
> describes what future states follow from the current state.  
> Often the function is deterministic, that is, for a given time interval 
> only one future state follows from the current state.  
> 
> However, some systems are stochastic, in that 
> random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.
>
> The study of dynamical systems is the focus of dynamical systems theory, 
> which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as 
> - mathematics, 
> - physics, 
> - biology, 
> - chemistry, 
> - engineering, 
> - economics, 
> - history, and 
> - medicine. 
> 
> Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of 
> - chaos theory, 
> - logistic map dynamics, 
> - bifurcation theory, the 
> - self-assembly and self-organization processes, and the 
> - edge of chaos concept.
