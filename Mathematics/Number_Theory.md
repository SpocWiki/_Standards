## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Number theory** is a branch of pure mathematics 
> devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions. 
> 
> German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) said, 
> "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics." 
> 
> Number theorists study prime numbers 
> as well as the properties of mathematical objects constructed from integers 
> (for example, rational numbers), 
> or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, algebraic integers).
>
> Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). 
> Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects 
> (for example, the Riemann zeta function) 
> that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion 
> (analytic number theory). 
> One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers; 
> for example, as approximated by the latter (Diophantine approximation).
>
> The older term for number theory is arithmetic. 
> By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by number theory. 
> (The word arithmetic is used by the general public to mean elementary calculations; 
> it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic, as in Peano arithmetic, 
> and computer science, as in floating-point arithmetic.) 
> 
> The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground 
> in the second half of the twentieth century, arguably in part due to French influence. 
> In particular, arithmetical is commonly preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.
