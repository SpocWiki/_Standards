> Many such models of computation have been proposed, the major ones being Turing machines, register machines, lambda calculus and general recursive functions. Although these four are of a very different nature, they provide exactly the same class of computable functions, and, for every model of computation that has ever been proposed, the computable functions for such a model are computable for the above four models of computation.

> Before the precise definition of computable functions, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable. This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. The effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be efficiently computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially (or even superexponentially) with the length of the input. The fields of feasible computability and computational complexity study functions that can be computed efficiently.

> The Blum axioms can be used to define an abstract computational complexity theory on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of computing the value of a function is known as a function problem, by contrast to decision problems whose results are either "yes" of "no".
