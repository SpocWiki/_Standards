> In mathematics, the Riemann sphere, named after Bernhard Riemann,
>  is a model of the extended complex plane (also called the closed complex plane): 
>  the complex plane plus one point at infinity. 
>  
>  This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, 
>  that is, the complex numbers plus a value ∞ for infinity. 
>  
>  With the Riemann model, the point ∞ is near to very large numbers, 
>  just as the point 0 is near to very small numbers.
>
> The extended complex numbers are useful in complex analysis, 
> because they allow for division by zero in some circumstances, 
> in a way that makes expressions such as 1 / 0 = ∞  well-behaved.  
> 
> For example, any rational function on the complex plane 
> can be extended to a holomorphic function on the Riemann sphere, 
> with the poles of the rational function mapping to infinity.  
> 
> More generally, any meromorphic function can be thought of as 
> a holomorphic function whose codomain is the Riemann sphere.
>
> In geometry, the Riemann sphere is the prototypical example of a Riemann surface, 
> and is one of the simplest complex manifolds. 
> 
> In projective geometry, the sphere is an example of a complex projective space 
> and can be thought of as the complex projective line P1(C)
> , the projective space of all complex lines in ℂ².
>
> As with any compact Riemann surface, the sphere may also be viewed as a projective algebraic curve, 
> making it a fundamental example in algebraic geometry. 
> 
> It also finds utility in other disciplines that depend on analysis and geometry, 
> such as the Bloch sphere of quantum mechanics and in other branches of physics.
