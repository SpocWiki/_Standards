> Linear programming (LP), also called linear optimization, is a method to achieve the best outcome 
> (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model 
> whose requirements and objective are represented by linear relationships. 
> Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming 
> (also known as mathematical optimization).
>
> More formally, linear programming is a technique for 
> the optimization of a **linear objective function**, subject to **linear inequality constraints**. 
> 
> Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a real-valued affine (linear) function defined on this polytope. A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the largest (or smallest) value if such a point exists.

> Linear programming can be applied to various fields of study. It is widely used in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, in business, economics, and some engineering problems. There is a close connection between linear programs, eigenequations, John von Neumann's general equilibrium model, and structural equilibrium models (see dual linear program for details).
