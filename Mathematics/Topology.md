> **Topology** (from the Greek words τόπος, 'place, location', and λόγος, 'study') 
> is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of a geometric object 
> that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; 
> that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.
>
> A topological space is a set endowed with a structure, called a topology, 
> which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. 
> 
> Euclidean spaces, and, more generally, metric spaces are examples of topological spaces, 
> as any distance or metric defines a topology. 
> The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. 
> 
> A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property. 
> The following are basic examples of topological properties: 
> - the dimension, which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface; 
> - compactness, which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle; 
> - connectedness, which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles.
>
> The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 
> who in the 17th century envisioned the geometria situs and analysis situs. 
> 
> Leonhard Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and polyhedron formula 
> are arguably the field's first theorems. 
> 
> The term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although, 
> it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.
