> In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic operations for integers, 
> other than the usual ones from elementary arithmetic, 
> where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. 
> 
> The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss 
> in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.
>
> A familiar example of modular arithmetic is the hour hand on a 12-hour clock. 
> If the hour hand points to 7 now, then 8 hours later it will point to 3. 
> Ordinary addition would result in 7 + 8 = 15, but  15 reads as 3 on the clock face. 
> This is because the hour hand makes one rotation every 12 hours 
> and the hour number starts over when the hour hand passes 12. 
> We say that 15 is congruent to 3 modulo 12, written 15 ≡ 3 (mod 12), 
> so that 7 + 8 ≡ 3 (mod 12). 
>
> Similarly, if one starts at 12 and waits 8 hours, the hour hand will be at 8. 
> If one instead waited twice as long, 16 hours, the hour hand would be on 4. 
> This can be written as 2 × 8 ≡ 4 (mod 12). 
> Note that after a wait of exactly 12 hours, 
> the hour hand will always be right where it was before, 
> so 12 acts the same as zero, thus 12 ≡ 0 (mod 12).
