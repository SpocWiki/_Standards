> An electronic **Calculator** is typically a portable electronic device 
> used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
>
> The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. 
> Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, 
> the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. 
> Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models 
> to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. 
> They became popular in the mid-1970s 
> as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. 
> By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point 
> where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.
>
> In addition to general-purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. 
> For example, there are scientific calculators, which include trigonometric and statistical calculations. 
> Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. 
> Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, 
> or higher-dimensional Euclidean space. 
> As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.
>
> Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix 
> have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, 
> and interactive BASIC could be used 
> to do calculations on most 1970s and 1980s home computers. 
> 
> Calculator functions are included in most smartphones, tablets, 
> and personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices. 
> With the very wide availability of smartphones and the like, 
> dedicated hardware calculators, while still widely used, 
> are less common than they once were.  
> 
> In 1986, calculators still represented 
> 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. 
> By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.
