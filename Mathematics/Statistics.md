## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Statistics** (from German: Statistik, orig. "description of a state, a country") 
> is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. 
> 
> In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, 
> it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. 
> Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects 
> such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". 
> 
> Statistics deals with every aspect of data, 
> including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
>
> When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data 
> by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. 
> 
> Representative sampling assures that 
> __inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population__ as a whole. 
> 
> # experimental study
> An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, 
> manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure 
> to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. 
> # observational study
> In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.
>
> Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: 
> descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample 
> using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and 
> inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation 
> (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). 
>
> Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two properties of a distribution (sample or population): 
> central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, 
> while dispersion (or variability) characterizes the extent 
> to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. 
>
> Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory, 
> which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.
>
> A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data 
> leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, 
> or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. 
> 
> A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, 
> an alternative to an __idealized null hypothesis of no relationship__ between two data sets. 
> Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using 
> statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, 
> given the data that are used in the test. 
> Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: 
> - Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a "false positive") and 
> - Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a "false negative"). 
> Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, 
> ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.
>
> Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate. 
> Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), 
> but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. 
> The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates 
> and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Stochastic** (; from Ancient Greek  στόχος (stókhos) 'aim, guess') is the property of 
> being well-described by a random probability distribution. 
>
> Stochasticity and randomness are technically distinct concepts: 
> the former refers to a modeling approach, while the latter describes phenomena; 
> in everyday conversation, however, these terms are often used interchangeably. 
> In probability theory, the formal concept of a stochastic process is also referred to as a random process.
>
> Stochasticity is used in many different fields, including the natural sciences such as biology, technology 
> and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, computer science, 
> information theory and telecommunications, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics, and cryptography. 
> 
> It is also used in finance (e.g., stochastic oscillator), 
> due to seemingly random changes in the different markets within the financial sector 
> and in medicine, linguistics,  music, media, color theory,  botany, manufacturing and geomorphology.
