## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, the **Commutator** gives an indication of the extent 
> to which a certain binary operation fails to be commutative. 
> There are different definitions used in group theory and ring theory.
> 
> The commutator of two elements, g and h, of a group G, is the element
> 
> [g, h] = g−1h−1gh.
>
> This element is equal to the group's identity if and only if g and h commute (that is, if and only if gh = hg).
>
> The Commutators of a group are not in general closed under the group operation, 
> but the subgroup of G generated by all commutators is closed and is 
> called the derived group or the commutator subgroup of G. 
> 
> Commutators are used to define nilpotent and solvable groups 
> and the largest abelian quotient group.
>
> The definition of the commutator above is used throughout this article, 
> but many other group theorists define the commutator as
> 
> [g, h] = ghg−1h−1.

> Commutator identities are an important tool in group theory.

> Many identities that are true modulo certain subgroups are also used.  
> These can be particularly useful in the study of solvable groups and nilpotent groups.  For instance, in any group, second powers behave well:

> Rings often do not support division. Thus, the commutator of two elements a and b of a ring (or any associative algebra) is defined differently by

>      [a,b]=ab-ba.}
> The commutator is zero if and only if a and b commute. In linear algebra, if two endomorphisms of a space are represented by commuting matrices in terms of one basis, then they are so represented in terms of every basis. By using the commutator as a Lie bracket, every associative algebra can be turned into a Lie algebra.

> Sometimes

>
>  is used to denote anticommutator, while 
>
>      [a,b]_{-}}   is then used for commutator. 
>  The anticommutator is used less often, but can be used to define Clifford algebras and Jordan algebras and in the derivation of the Dirac equation in particle physics.
>
> The commutator of two operators acting on a Hilbert space is a central concept in quantum mechanics, since it quantifies how well the two observables described by these operators can be measured simultaneously. The uncertainty principle is ultimately a theorem about such commutators, by virtue of the Robertson–Schrödinger relation. In phase space, equivalent commutators of function star-products are called Moyal brackets and are completely isomorphic to the Hilbert space commutator structures mentioned.
