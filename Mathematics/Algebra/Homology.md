> In mathematics, the term homology, originally introduced in algebraic topology, 
> has three primary, closely related usages relating to 
> - chain complexes, 
> - mathematical objects, and 
> - topological spaces respectively. 
> 
> First, the most direct usage of the term is to take the homology of a chain complex, resulting in a sequence of abelian groups called homology groups. 
> 
> Secondly, as chain complexes are obtained from various other types of mathematical objects, 
> this operation allows one to associate various named homologies or homology theories to these objects. 
> 
> Finally, since there are many homology theories for topological spaces that produce the same answer, 
> one also often speaks of the homology of a topological space. 
> (This latter notion of homology admits more intuitive descriptions for 1- or 2-dimensional topological spaces, and is sometimes referenced in popular mathematics.) There is also a related notion of the cohomology of a cochain complex, giving rise to various cohomology theories, in addition to the notion of the cohomology of a topological space.
