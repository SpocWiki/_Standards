## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Elementary algebra, also known as high school algebra or college algebra, 
> encompasses the basic concepts of algebra. 
> It is often contrasted with arithmetic: arithmetic deals with specified numbers, 
> whilst algebra introduces numerical variables (quantities without fixed values).
>
> This use of variables entails use of algebraic notation 
> and an understanding of the general rules of the operations introduced in arithmetic: 
> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. 
> 
> Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with 
> algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers.
>
> It is typically taught to secondary school students and at introductory college level in the United States, 
> and builds on their understanding of arithmetic. 
> 
> The use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities 
> to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. 
> Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic equations.
