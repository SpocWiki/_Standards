> In mathematics, the distributive property of binary operations is a generalization of the distributive law, 
> which asserts that the equality x ⋅ (y+z) = x⋅y + x⋅z
> is always true in elementary algebra.
>
> For example, in elementary arithmetic, one has 2 ⋅ (1 + 3) = (2⋅1) + (2⋅3)
.
> Therefore, one would say that multiplication distributes over addition.
>
> This basic property of numbers is part of the definition of 
> most algebraic structures that have two operations called addition and multiplication, 
> such as complex numbers, polynomials, matrices, rings, and fields. 
> It is also encountered in Boolean algebra and mathematical logic, 
> where each of the logical and (denoted ∧) and the logical or (denoted ∨) distributes over the other.
