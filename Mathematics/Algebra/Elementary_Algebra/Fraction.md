> A **Fraction** (from Latin: fractus, "broken") represents a part of a whole 
> or, more generally, any number of equal parts. 
> 
> When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, 
> for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. 
> 
> A common, vulgar, or simple fraction (examples: ⁠1/2⁠ and ⁠17/3⁠) consists of an integer numerator, 
> displayed above a line (or before a slash like 1⁄2), 
> and a non-zero integer denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. 
> 
> If these integers are positive, then the numerator represents a number of equal parts, 
> and the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. 
> For example, in the fraction ⁠3/4⁠, the numerator 3 indicates that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, 
> and the denominator 4 indicates that 4 parts make up a whole. The picture to the right illustrates ⁠3/4⁠ of a cake.
>
> Fractions can be used to represent ratios and division. 
> Thus the fraction ⁠3/4⁠ can be used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole), 
> and the division 3 ÷ 4 (three divided by four).
>
> We can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. For example, if ⁠1/2⁠ represents a half-dollar profit, then −⁠1/2⁠ represents a half-dollar loss. Because of the rules of division of signed numbers (which states in part that negative divided by positive is negative), −⁠1/2⁠, ⁠−1/2⁠ and ⁠1/−2⁠ all represent the same fraction –  negative one-half. And because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, ⁠−1/−2⁠ represents positive one-half.
>
> In mathematics a rational number is a number that can be represented by a fraction of the form ⁠a/b⁠, 
> where a and b are integers and b is positive; 
> the set of all rational numbers is commonly represented by the symbol ⁠Q, which stands for quotient. 
> The term fraction and the notation ⁠a/b⁠ can also be used for mathematical expressions 
> that do not represent a rational number (for example √2/2), 
> and even do not represent any number (for example the rational fraction 1/x).
