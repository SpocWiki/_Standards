> In mathematics, to solve an equation is to find its solutions, 
> which are the values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) that fulfill the condition stated by the equation, 
> consisting generally of two expressions related by an equals sign. 
> 
> When seeking a solution, one or more variables are designated as unknowns. 
> A solution is an assignment of values to the unknown variables that makes the equality in the equation true. 
> In other words, a solution is a value or a collection of values (one for each unknown) 
> such that, when substituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes an equality.
>
> A solution of an equation is often called a root of the equation, particularly but not only for polynomial equations. 
> The set of all solutions of an equation is its solution set.
>
> An equation may be solved either numerically or symbolically. 
> Solving an equation numerically means that only numbers are admitted as solutions. 
> Solving an equation symbolically means that expressions can be used for representing the solutions.

> For example, the equation x + y = 2x – 1 is solved for the unknown x by the expression x = y + 1, because substituting y + 1 for x in the equation results in (y + 1) + y = 2(y + 1) – 1, a true statement. It is also possible to take the variable y to be the unknown, and then the equation is solved by y = x – 1. Or x and y can both be treated as unknowns, and then there are many solutions to the equation; a symbolic solution is (x, y) = (a + 1, a), where the variable a may take any value. Instantiating a symbolic solution with specific numbers gives a numerical solution; for example, a = 0 gives (x, y) = (1, 0) (that is, x = 1, y = 0), and a = 1 gives (x, y) = (2, 1).

> The distinction between known variables and unknown variables is generally made in the statement of the problem, 
> by phrases such as "an equation in x and y", or "solve for x and y", which indicate the unknowns, here x and y.
>
> However, it is common to reserve x, y, z, ... to denote the unknowns, 
> and to use a, b, c, ... to denote the known variables, which are often called parameters. 
> This is typically the case when considering polynomial equations, such as quadratic equations. 
> However, for some problems, all variables may assume either role.
>
> Depending on the context, solving an equation may consist to find either any solution 
> (finding a single solution is enough), all solutions, 
> or a solution that satisfies further properties, such as belonging to a given interval. 
> 
> When the task is to find the solution that is the best under some criterion, this is an optimization problem. 
> Solving an optimization problem is generally not referred to as "equation solving", 
> as, generally, optimization methods start from a particular solution for finding a better solution, 
> and repeating the process until finding eventually the best solution.
