> Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with 
> investigating the connections between a function and its representation in frequency. 
> 
> The frequency representation is found by using the Fourier transform for functions 
> on unbounded domains such as the full real line 
> or by Fourier series for functions on bounded domains, 
> especially periodic functions on finite intervals. 
> 
> Generalizing these transforms to other domains is generally called [[Mathematics/Algebra/Linear_Algebra/Fourier_Analysis|Fourier_Analysis]], 
> although the term is sometimes used interchangeably with harmonic analysis. 
> Harmonic analysis has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as 
> - number theory, 
> - representation theory, 
> - signal processing, 
> - quantum mechanics, 
> - tidal analysis, 
> - spectral analysis, and 
> - neuroscience.

> The term "harmonics" originated from the Ancient Greek word harmonikos, meaning "skilled in music". 
> In physical eigenvalue problems, it began to mean 
> waves whose frequencies are integer multiples of one another, 
> as are the frequencies of the harmonics of music notes. 
> Still, the term has been generalized beyond its original meaning.
