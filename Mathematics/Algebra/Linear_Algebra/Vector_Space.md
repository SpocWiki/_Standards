> In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a **Linear space**) 
> is a set whose elements, often called vectors, can be added together 
> and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called scalars. 
> 
> The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication 
> must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. 
> 
> Real vector spaces and complex vector spaces are kinds of vector spaces 
> based on different kinds of scalars: real numbers and complex numbers. 
> Scalars can also be, more generally, elements of any [[../Group_Theory/Field(Math)]] .
>
> Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities (such as forces and velocity) that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrices, which allows computing in vector spaces. 
> This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating 
> and studying systems of linear equations.
>
> Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, 
> specifies the number of independent directions in the space. 
> 
> This means that, for two vector spaces over a given field and with the same dimension, 
> the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same 
> (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). 
> 
> A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. 
> Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. 
> Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. 
> Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. 
> For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, 
> and function spaces usually have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.
>
> Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics 
> are also endowed with other structures. 
> 
> This is the case of algebras, which include 
> - field extensions, 
> - polynomial rings, 
> - associative algebras and 
> - Lie algebras. 
> 
> This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include 
> - function spaces, 
> - inner product spaces, 
> - normed spaces, 
> - Hilbert spaces and 
> - Banach spaces.
