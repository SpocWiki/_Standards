# [[Banach_Space]]

#is_/same_as :: [[wd~Banach Space,]] 

A [[Hilbert_Space]] is a [[Banach_Space]] with an **inner product** ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ inducing the Norm 
∥x∥=⟨x,x⟩ 
## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a **Banach Space** 
> (Polish pronunciation: [ˈba.nax]) is a complete normed vector space. 
> 
> Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric 
> that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors 
> and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors 
> always converges to a well-defined limit that is within the space.
>
> Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, 
> who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920–1922 
> along with Hans Hahn and Eduard Helly. 
>
> Maurice René Fréchet was the first to use the term "Banach space" 
> and Banach in turn then coined the term "Fréchet space".
>
> Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of function spaces 
> by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz earlier in the century. 
> Banach spaces play a central role in functional analysis. 
> In other areas of analysis, the spaces under study are often Banach spaces.
