# [[Associator]] 


## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In abstract algebra, the term **Associator** is used in different ways 
> as a measure of the non-associativity of an algebraic structure. 
> 
> Associators are commonly studied as triple systems.
> For a non-associative ring or algebra R, the associator is the multilinear map 
>    [⋅,⋅,⋅] : R × R × R → R  given by [x,y,z]=(xy)z-x(yz).
>    
> Just as the [[Commutator]] [x,y]=xy-yx measures the degree of non-commutativity, 
> the associator measures the degree of non-associativity of R.
>
> For an associative ring or algebra the associator is identically zero.
>
> The associator in any ring obeys the identity
>      w[x,y,z] + [w,x,y]z = [wx,y,z] - [w,xy,z] + [w,x,yz].
>   
> 
> The associator is __alternating__ precisely when R is an alternative ring.
>
> The associator is __symmetric__ in its two rightmost arguments when R is a pre-Lie algebra.
>
> The [[nucleus]] is the set of elements that associate with all others: that is, the 
> _n_ in R such that  [n,R,R] = [R,n,R] = [R,R,n] = {0} .
>   
> The nucleus is an associative subring of R.
>
> A quasigroup Q is a set with a binary operation ⋅ :Q× Q→ Q such that for each a, b in Q,
> the equations 
>
>     {\displaystyle a⋅ x=b}
>  and 
>     {\displaystyle y⋅ a=b}
>  have unique solutions x, y in Q. In a quasigroup Q, the associator is the map 
>     {\displaystyle (⋅ ,⋅ ,⋅ ):Q× Q× Q→ Q}
>  defined by the equation
>     {\displaystyle (a⋅ b)⋅ c=(a⋅ (b⋅ c))⋅ (a,b,c)}
> for all a, b, c in Q. As with its ring theory analog, the quasigroup associator is a measure of nonassociativity of Q.
> In higher-dimensional algebra, where there may be non-identity morphisms between algebraic expressions, an associator is an isomorphism
>     {\displaystyle a_{x,y,z}:(xy)z\mapsto x(yz).}
> In category theory, the associator expresses the associative properties of the internal product functor in monoidal categories.
