> In algebra, ring theory is the study of rings, 
> algebraic structures in which addition and multiplication are defined 
> and have similar properties to those operations defined for the integers. 
> 
> Ring theory studies the structure of rings; their representations, 
> or, in different language, modules; special classes of rings 
> (group rings, division rings, universal enveloping algebras); 
> related structures like rngs; as well as an array of properties 
> that prove to be of interest both within the theory itself and for its applications, 
> such as homological properties and polynomial identities.
>
> Commutative rings are much better understood than noncommutative ones. 
> 
> Algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, 
> which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, 
> have driven much of the development of commutative ring theory, which is now, 
> under the name of commutative algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. 
> 
> Because these three fields are so intimately connected
> (algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra)  
> it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. 
> 
> For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. 
> 
> Similarly, Fermat's Last Theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, 
> which is a part of commutative algebra, 
> but its proof involves deep results of both algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.
>
> Noncommutative rings are quite different in flavour, since more unusual behavior can arise. 
> While the theory has developed in its own right, 
> a fairly recent trend has sought to parallel the commutative development 
> by building the theory of certain classes of noncommutative rings in a geometric fashion 
> as if they were rings of functions on (non-existent) 'noncommutative spaces'. 
> 
> This trend started in the 1980s with the development of noncommutative geometry 
> and with the discovery of quantum groups. 
> It has led to a better understanding of noncommutative rings, 
> especially noncommutative Noetherian rings.
