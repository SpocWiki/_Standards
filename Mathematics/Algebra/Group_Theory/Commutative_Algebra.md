> Commutative algebra, first known as ideal theory, 
> is the branch of algebra that studies commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. 
> 
> Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. 
> Prominent examples of commutative rings include 
> - polynomial rings; 
> - rings of algebraic integers, including the 
> - ordinary integers Z and p-adic integers.
>
> Commutative algebra is the main technical tool of algebraic geometry, 
> and many results and concepts of commutative algebra 
> are strongly related with geometrical concepts.
>
> The study of rings that are not necessarily commutative is known as noncommutative algebra; 
> it includes ring theory, representation theory, and the theory of Banach algebras.
