## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, an abelian group, also called a commutative group, 
> is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements 
> does not depend on the order in which they are written. 
> 
> That is, the group operation is commutative. 
> 
> With addition as an operation, the integers and the real numbers form abelian groups, 
> and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples. 
> Abelian groups are named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.
>
> The concept of an abelian group underlies many fundamental algebraic structures, 
> such as fields, rings, vector spaces, and algebras. 
> 
> The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, 
> and finite abelian groups are very well understood and fully classified.
