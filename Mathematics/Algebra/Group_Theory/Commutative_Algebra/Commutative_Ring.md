> In mathematics, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative. 
> The study of commutative rings is called commutative algebra. 
> 
> Complementarily, noncommutative algebra is the study of ring properties 
> that are not specific to commutative rings. 
> 
> This distinction results from the **high number of fundamental properties of commutative rings** 
> that do not extend to noncommutative rings.
>
> Commutative rings appear in the following chain of class inclusions:
>
> rngs ⊃ rings ⊃ commutative rings ⊃  integral domains ⊃ integrally closed domains ⊃ GCD domains ⊃ unique factorization domains ⊃ principal ideal domains ⊃ euclidean domains ⊃ fields ⊃ algebraically closed fields
