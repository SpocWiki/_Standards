> In mathematics, a **Conjecture** is a proposition that is proffered on a tentative basis without proof. 
> Some conjectures, such as the Riemann hypothesis or Fermat's conjecture 
> (now a theorem, proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles), 
> have shaped much of mathematical history 
> as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.
