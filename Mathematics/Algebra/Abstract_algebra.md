> In mathematics, more specifically algebra, abstract algebra or modern algebra 
> is the study of algebraic structures, which are sets with specific operations acting on their elements. 
> 
> Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, 
> and algebras over a field. 
> 
> The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century 
> to distinguish it from older parts of algebra, and more specifically from elementary algebra, 
> the use of variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning. 
> 
> The abstract perspective on algebra has become so fundamental to advanced mathematics 
> that it is simply called "algebra", 
> while the term "abstract algebra" is seldom used except in pedagogy.
>
> Algebraic structures, with their associated homomorphisms, form mathematical categories. 
> Category theory gives a unified framework to study properties 
> and constructions that are similar for various structures.
>
> Universal algebra is a related subject that studies types of algebraic structures as single objects. 
> For example, the structure of groups is a single object in universal algebra, 
> which is called the variety of groups.
