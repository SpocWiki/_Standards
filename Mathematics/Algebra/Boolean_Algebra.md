> In mathematics and mathematical logic, **Boolean algebra** is a branch of algebra. 
> It differs from elementary algebra in two ways. 
> 1. First, the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0, 
>    whereas in elementary algebra the values of the variables are numbers. 
> 2. Second, Boolean algebra uses logical operators such as 
>   - conjunction (and) denoted as ∧, 
>   - disjunction (or) denoted as ∨, and 
>   - negation (not) denoted as ¬. 
> Elementary algebra, on the other hand, uses arithmetic operators 
> such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. 
> Boolean algebra is therefore a formal way of describing logical operations 
> in the same way that elementary algebra describes numerical operations.
>
> Boolean algebra was introduced by [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematician/Boole,George]] in his first book 
> The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847), 
> and set forth more fully in his An Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854).
>
> According to Huntington, the term "Boolean algebra" was first suggested by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913, 
> although [[../../../_Standards/Mathematics/Mathematician/Peirce,Charles_Sanders|Charles Sanders Peirce]] gave the title "A Boolian [sic] Algebra with One Constant" 
> to the first chapter of his "The Simplest Mathematics" in 1880. 
> Boolean algebra has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics, 
> and is provided for in all modern programming languages. 
> It is also used in set theory and statistics.
