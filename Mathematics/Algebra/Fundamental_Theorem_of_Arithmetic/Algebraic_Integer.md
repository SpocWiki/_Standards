> In algebraic number theory, an **algebraic integer** is a complex number that is integral over the integers. 
> That is, an algebraic integer is a complex root of some monic polynomial 
> (a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1) whose coefficients are integers. 
> 
> The set of all algebraic integers A is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication 
> and therefore is a commutative subring of the complex numbers.
>
> The ring of integers of a number field K, denoted by OK, is the intersection of K and A: 
> it can also be characterized as the maximal order of the field K. 
> 
> Each algebraic integer belongs to the ring of integers of some number field. 
> A number α is an algebraic integer if and only if the ring Z[α] 
>  is finitely generated as an abelian group, which is to say, as a Z-module.
