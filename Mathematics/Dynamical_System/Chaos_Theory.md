> Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary area of scientific study and branch of mathematics. 
> It focuses on underlying patterns and deterministic 
> laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. 
> 
> These were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities. 
> Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, 
> there are underlying patterns, interconnection, constant feedback loops, 
> repetition, self-similarity, fractals and self-organization. 
> 
> The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, 
> describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system 
> can result in large differences in a later state 
> (meaning there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). 
> 
> A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil 
> can cause or prevent a tornado in Texas.
>
> Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements 
> or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, 
> can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, 
> rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. 
> 
> This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, 
> meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution 
> and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. 
> 
> In other words, despite the deterministic nature of these systems, 
> this does not make them predictable. 
> This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. 
> The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:
>
> Chaos: When the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.
>
> Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. 
> 
> It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as road traffic. 
> 
> This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model 
> or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and PoincarÃ© maps. 
> 
> Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including 
> - meteorology, 
> - anthropology, 
> - sociology, 
> - environmental science, 
> - computer science, 
> - engineering, 
> - economics, 
> - ecology, and 
> - pandemic crisis management. 
> 
> The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, 
> edge of chaos theory and self-assembly processes.
