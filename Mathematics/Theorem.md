> In mathematics and formal logic, 
> a **Theorem** is a statement that has been proven, or can be proven. 
> 
> The proof of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the inference rules of a deductive system 
> to establish that the theorem is a logical 
> consequence of the axioms and previously proved theorems.
>
> In mainstream mathematics, the axioms and the inference rules are commonly left implicit, 
> and are almost always those of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC), 
> or of a less powerful theory, such as Peano arithmetic. 
> 
> Generally, an assertion that is explicitly called a theorem is a proved result 
> that is not an immediate consequence of other known theorems. 
> 
> Moreover, many authors qualify as theorems only the most important results, 
> and use the terms lemma, proposition and corollary for less important theorems.
>
> In mathematical logic, the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized 
> in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them. 
> 
> In this context, statements become well-formed formulas of some formal language. 
> A theory consists of some basis statements called axioms, 
> and some deducing rules (sometimes included in the axioms). 
> 
> The theorems of the theory are the statements that can be derived from the axioms 
> by using the deducing rules. 
> 
> This formalization led to proof theory, 
> which allows proving general theorems about theorems and proofs. 
> In particular, Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that 
> every consistent theory containing the natural numbers has true statements on natural numbers 
> that are not theorems of the theory (that is they cannot be proved inside the theory).
>
> As the axioms are often abstractions of properties of the physical world, 
> theorems may be considered as expressing some truth, 
> but in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental, 
> the justification of the truth of a theorem is purely deductive.
>
> A conjecture is a tentative proposition that may evolve to become a theorem if proven true.
