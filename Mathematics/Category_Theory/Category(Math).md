> In mathematics, a category (sometimes called an abstract category 
> to distinguish it from a concrete category) is a collection of "objects" that are linked by "arrows". 
> 
> A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively 
> and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.  
> A simple example is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions.
>
> Category theory is a branch of mathematics 
> that seeks to generalize all of mathematics in terms of categories, 
> independent of what their objects and arrows represent.  
> 
> Virtually every branch of modern mathematics can be described in terms of categories, 
> and doing so often reveals deep insights and similarities 
> between seemingly different areas of mathematics.  
> 
> As such, category theory provides an alternative foundation for mathematics 
> to set theory and other proposed axiomatic foundations.  
> In general, the objects and arrows may be abstract entities of any kind, 
> and the notion of category provides a fundamental and abstract way 
> to describe mathematical entities and their relationships.
>
> In addition to formalizing mathematics, category theory is 
> also used to formalize many other systems in computer science, 
> such as the semantics of programming languages.
>
> Two categories are the same if they have the same collection of objects, 
> the same collection of arrows, and the same associative method of composing any pair of arrows. 
> 
> Two different categories may also be considered "equivalent" for purposes of category theory, 
> even if they do not have precisely the same structure.
>
> Well-known categories are denoted by a short capitalized word or abbreviation in bold or italics:  
> examples include 
> - **Set**, the category of sets and set functions; 
> - **Ring**, the category of rings and ring homomorphisms; and 
> - **Top**, the category of topological spaces and continuous maps. 
> All of the preceding categories have the identity map as identity arrows 
> and composition as the associative operation on arrows.
>
> The classic and still much used text on category theory is 
> Categories for the Working Mathematician by Saunders Mac Lane. 
>
> Any monoid can be understood as a special sort of category 
> (with a single object whose self-morphisms are represented by the elements of the monoid), 
> and so can any preorder.

## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Classification is the activity of assigning objects to some pre-existing classes or categories. This is distinct from the task of establishing the classes themselves (for example through cluster analysis). Examples include diagnostic tests, identifying spam emails and deciding whether to give someone a driving license. 
>
> As well as '**Category**', synonyms or near-synonyms for 'class' include 'type', 'species', 'forms', 'order', 'concept', 'taxon', 'group', 'identification' and 'division'. 
>
> The meaning of the word 'classification' (and its synonyms) may take on one of several related meanings. It may encompass both classification and the creation of classes, as for example in 'the task of categorizing pages in Wikipedia'; this overall activity is listed under taxonomy. It may refer exclusively to the underlying scheme of classes (which otherwise may be called a taxonomy). Or it may refer to the label given to an object by the classifier.
>
> Classification is a part of many different kinds of activities and is studied from many different points of view including medicine, philosophy, law, anthropology, biology, taxonomy, cognition, communications, knowledge organization, psychology, statistics, machine learning, economics and mathematics.
