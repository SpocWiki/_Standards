> In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple (Ω, F,P)
>  is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". 
>  
>  For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a dice.
> A probability space consists of three elements:
> A sample space Ω, which is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process under consideration.
>
> An event space F, which is a set of events, 
> where an event is a subset of outcomes in the sample space.
>
> A probability function P, which assigns, to each event in the event space, a probability, 
> which is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
>
> In order to provide a model of probability, these elements must satisfy probability axioms.
>
> In the example of the throw of a standard die,
> The sample space Ω is typically the set {1,2,3,4
>         ,
>         5
>         ,
>         6
>         }
>  where each element in the set is a label which represents the outcome of the die landing on that label. For example, 
>         1
>  represents the outcome that the die lands on 1.
>
> The event space F could be the set of all subsets of the sample space, which would then contain simple events such as {5}  ("the die lands on 5"), 
> as well as complex events such as {2,4,6}  ("the die lands on an even number").
>
> The probability function P would then map each event to the number of outcomes in that event divided by 6 – so for example, {5}
>  would be mapped to 1/6
> , and  {2,4,6}
>  would be mapped to 3/6=1/2 
>   
> When an experiment is conducted, it results in exactly one outcome ω from the sample space Ω. 
> All the events in the event space F that contain the selected outcome ω
>  are said to "have occurred". The probability function P
>  must be so defined that if the experiment were repeated arbitrarily many times, the number of occurrences of each event as a fraction of the total number of experiments, will most likely tend towards the probability assigned to that event.
