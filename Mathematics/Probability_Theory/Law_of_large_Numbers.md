## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In probability theory, the law of large numbers is a mathematical law 
> that states that the average of the results 
> obtained from a large number of independent random samples 
> converges to the true value, if it exists. 
> 
> More formally, the law of large numbers states that given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean. 
>
> The law of large numbers is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. Importantly, the law applies (as the name indicates) only when a large number of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the gambler's fallacy).
>
> The law of large numbers only applies to the average of the results obtained from repeated trials and claims that this average converges to the expected value; it does not claim that the sum of n results gets close to the expected value times n as n increases.
>
> Throughout its history, many mathematicians have refined this law. Today, the law of large numbers is used in many fields including statistics, probability theory, economics, and insurance.
