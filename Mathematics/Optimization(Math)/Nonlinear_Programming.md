> In mathematics, nonlinear programming (NLP) 
> is the process of solving an optimization problem 
> where some of the constraints are not linear equalities 
> or the objective function is not a linear function. 
> 
> An optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema 
> (maxima, minima or stationary points) of an objective function 
> over a set of unknown real variables 
> and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of equalities and inequalities, 
> collectively termed constraints. 
> 
> It is the sub-field of mathematical optimization that deals with problems that are not linear.
