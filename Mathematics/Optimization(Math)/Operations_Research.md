> Operations research (British English: operational research) 
> (U.S. Air Force Specialty Code: Operations Analysis), often shortened to the initialism OR, 
> is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the development 
> and application of analytical methods to improve management and decision-making. 
> The term management science is occasionally used as a synonym.
>
> Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, 
> such as modeling, statistics, and optimization, 
> operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to decision-making problems. 
> 
> Because of its emphasis on practical applications, 
> operations research has overlapped with many other disciplines, 
> notably industrial engineering. 
> 
> Operations research is often concerned with 
> determining the extreme values of some real-world objective: 
> the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) 
> or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost). 
> 
> Originating in military efforts before World War II, 
> its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.
