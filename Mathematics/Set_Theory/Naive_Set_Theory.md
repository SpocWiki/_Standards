## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Naive set theory is any of several theories of sets 
> used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics.
>
> Unlike **axiomatic set theories, which are defined using formal logic**, 
> naive set theory is defined informally, in natural language. 
> 
> It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics 
> (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), 
> and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.
>
> Sets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, 
> most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) 
> are defined in terms of sets. 
> 
> Naive set theory suffices for many purposes, 
> while also serving as a stepping stone towards more formal treatments.
