## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In Mathematics, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy) is a set-theoretic paradox 
> published by the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell, in 1901. 
> 
> Russell's paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle 
> leads to contradictions.  
>
> According to the unrestricted comprehension principle, 
> for any sufficiently well-defined property, 
> there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property. 
> 
> Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. 
> (This set is sometimes called "the Russell set".)  
> If R is not a member of itself, then its definition entails that it is a member of itself; 
> yet, if it is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself, 
> since it is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. 
> 
> The resulting contradiction is Russell's paradox. In symbols:
> Let R = {x ∣ x ∉ x }
> 
> Then R ∈ R ⟺ R ∉ R
>
> Russell also showed that a version of the paradox 
> could be derived in the axiomatic system 
> constructed by the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege, 
> hence undermining Frege's attempt to reduce mathematics to logic 
> and calling into question the logicist programme. 
> 
> Two influential ways of avoiding the paradox were both proposed in 1908: 
> - Russell's own type theory and 
> - the Zermelo set theory. 
> 
> In particular, Zermelo's axioms restricted the unlimited comprehension principle. 
> With the additional contributions of Abraham Fraenkel, 
> Zermelo set theory developed into the standard Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory 
> (commonly known as ZFC when including the axiom of choice). 
> 
> The main difference between Russell's and Zermelo's solution to the paradox is that 
> - Zermelo modified the axioms of set theory while maintaining a standard logical language, 
> - while Russell modified the logical language itself. 
> The language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem, turned out to be that of first-order logic.
>
> The paradox had already been discovered independently in 1899 
> by the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo. 
> 
> However, Zermelo did not publish the idea, which remained known only to 
> David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and other academics at the University of Göttingen. 
> 
> At the end of the 1890s, Georg Cantor – considered the founder of modern set theory – 
> had already realized that his theory would lead to a contradiction, 
> as he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter.
