> **Giuseppe Peano** (Italian: [dʒuˈzɛppe peˈaːno]; 27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) 
> was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. 
> The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, 
> to which he contributed much notation. 
> 
> The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the [[Peano_Axioms]] in his honor. 
> As part of this effort, he made key contributions to 
> the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. 
> He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. 
> He also wrote an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione ("Latin without inflections"), 
> which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. 
> Most of his books and papers are in Latino sine flexione, while others are in Italian.
