> **Blaise Pascal** (19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) 
> was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and Catholic writer.
>
> Pascal was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. 
> His earliest mathematical work was on  projective geometry; 
> he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of conic sections at the age of 16. 
> 
> He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, 
> strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. 
> 
> In 1642, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines 
> (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines), 
> establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.
>
> Like his contemporary René Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. 
> Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. 
> 
> He made important contributions to the study of fluids, 
> and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. 
> Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, in 1647 he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes 
> who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum.
>
> He is also credited as the inventor of modern public transportation, 
> having established the carrosses à cinq sols, the first modern public transport service, 
> shortly before his death in 1662.
>
> In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified 
> with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. 
> 
> Following a religious experience in late 1654, 
> he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. 
> 
> His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées, 
> the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. 
> The latter contains Pascal's wager, known in the original as the Discourse on the Machine, 
> a fideistic probabilistic argument for why one should believe in God. 
> 
> In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. 
> Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids. 
> Following several years of illness, Pascal died in Paris at the age of 39.
