> **Charles Sanders Peirce** (1839-09-10 – 1914-04-19) 
> was an American scientist, mathematician,  logician, and philosopher 
> who is sometimes known as "the father of pragmatism". 
> According to philosopher Paul Weiss, Peirce was "the most original and versatile of America's philosophers and America's greatest logician". 
>[[Russell,Bertrand|Bertrand Russell]]] wrote "he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century 
> and certainly the greatest American thinker ever". 
>
> Educated as a chemist and __employed as a scientist for thirty years__, 
> Peirce meanwhile made major contributions to logic, such as theories of relations and quantification. 
> C. I. Lewis wrote, "The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century." 
> For Peirce, logic also encompassed much of what is now called epistemology 
> and the philosophy of science. 
> He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics or study of signs, of which he is a founder, 
> which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. 
> Peirce's study of signs also included a tripartite theory of predication.  
>
> Additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulating mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. 
> He was one of the founders of statistics. 
> As early as 1886, he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits (50 years before Shannon). 
> The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers. 
> 
> For metaphysics, Peirce was an "objective idealist" 
> in the tradition of German philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as a scholastic realist about universals. 
> He also held a commitment to the ideas of continuity and chance as real features of the universe, 
> views he labeled synechism and tychism respectively. 
> Peirce believed an epistemic fallibilism and anti-skepticism went along with these views.

He was a tragic figure, who died poor, 
because was shunned by the scientific community in Harvard and the US east coast.
