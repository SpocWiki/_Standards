> Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic 
> that are concerned with the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories. 
> 
> These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, 
> are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. 
> The theorems are interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program 
> to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.
>
> The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms 
> whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e. an algorithm) 
> is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. 
> 
> For any such consistent formal system, 
> there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, 
> but that are unprovable within the system. 
> Equivalently, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are false, 
> but that are unprovably false within the system.
>
> The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.
>
> Employing a diagonal argument, Gödel's incompleteness theorems were among the first of 
> several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. 
> They were followed by Tarski's undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, 
> Church's proof that Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable, 
> and Turing's theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem.
