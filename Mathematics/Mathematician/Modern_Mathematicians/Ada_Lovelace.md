> Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), 
> also known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer 
> chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's 
> proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
> She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.
>
> Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron 
> and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. 
> 
> All her half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, 
> were born out of wedlock to other women. 
> 
> Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. 
> He died in Greece when she was eight. 
> Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter's upbringing 
> and promoted Lovelace's interest in mathematics and logic 
> in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. 
> Despite this, Lovelace remained interested in her father, 
> naming one son Byron and the other, for her father's middle name, Gordon. 
> 
> Upon her death, she was buried next to her father at her request. 
> Although often ill in her childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies assiduously. 
> She married William King in 1835. 
> King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, 
> Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.
>
> Lovelace's educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists 
> such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone 
> and Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, 
> contacts which she used to further her education. 
> Lovelace described her approach as "poetical science" 
> and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".
>
> When she was eighteen, Lovelace's mathematical talents led her to a long 
> working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage. 
> She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. 
> Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, 
> when she and her mother attended one of Charles Babbage's Saturday night soirées 
> with their mutual friend, and Lovelace's private tutor, Mary Somerville.
>
> Though Babbage's Analytical Engine was never constructed 
> and exercised no influence on the later invention of electronic computers, 
> it has been recognised in retrospect as a Turing-complete general-purpose computer 
> which anticipated the essential features of a modern electronic computer; 
> Babbage is therefore known as the "father of computers," 
> and Lovelace is credited with several computing "firsts" for her collaboration with him.
>
> Between 1842 and 1843, Lovelace translated an 
> article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) 
> about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with seven long explanatory notes. 
> These notes described a method of using the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers 
> which is often called the first published computer program.
>
> She also developed a vision of the capability of computers 
> to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, 
> while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. 
> 
> Lovelace was the first to point out the possibility of encoding information 
> besides mere arithmetical figures, such as music, and manipulating it with such a machine. 
> 
> Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine 
> (as shown in her notes), 
> examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.
>
> Ada is widely commemorated, including in the names of a programming language, 
> several roads, buildings and institutes as well as programmes, lectures and courses.  
> There are also a number of plaques, statues, paintings, literary and non-fiction works.
