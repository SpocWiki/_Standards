> John von Neumann ( von NOY-mən; Hungarian: Neumann János Lajos [ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ]; 
> December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian and American 
> mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer and polymath. 
> 
> He had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time,  
> integrating pure and applied sciences and making major contributions to many fields, 
> including mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and statistics. 
> 
> He was a pioneer in building the mathematical framework of quantum physics, 
> in the development of functional analysis, and in game theory, 
> introducing or codifying concepts including cellular automata, 
> the universal constructor and the digital computer. 
> His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.
>
> During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project. 
> He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses 
> used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon. 
> 
> Before and after the war, he consulted for many organizations 
> including the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, 
> the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
> 
> At the peak of his influence in the 1950s, he chaired a number of Defense Department committees 
> including the Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee and the[[../../../../Knowledge/Military.internal/ICBM]]] Scientific Advisory Committee. 
> He was also a member of the influential Atomic Energy Commission 
> in charge of all atomic energy development in the country. 
> 
> He played a key role alongside Bernard Schriever and Trevor Gardner 
> in the design and development of the United States' first ICBM programs. 
> At that time he was considered the nation's foremost expert on nuclear weaponry 
> and the leading defense scientist at the U.S. Department of Defense.
>
> Von Neumann's contributions and intellectual ability drew praise from colleagues in physics, 
> mathematics, and beyond. 
> Accolades he received range from the Medal of Freedom to a crater on the Moon named in his honor.
