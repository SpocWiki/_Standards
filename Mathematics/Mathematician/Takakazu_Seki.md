> Seki Takakazu (関 孝和; c. March 1642 – December 5, 1708), AKA Seki Kōwa (関 孝和), 
> was a mathematician, samurai, and Kofu feudal officer of the early Edo period of Japan. 
>
> Seki laid foundations for the subsequent development of Japanese mathematics, 
> known as wasan from c. 1870. He has been described as "Japan's Newton".
>
> He created a new algebraic notation system and, motivated by astronomical computations, 
> did work on infinitesimal calculus and Diophantine equations. 
> 
> Although he was a contemporary of 
> - German polymath mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and 
> - British polymath physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton, Seki's work was independent. 
> His successors later developed a school dominant in Japanese mathematics 
> until the end of the Edo period.
>
> While it is not clear how much of the achievements of wasan are Seki's, 
> since many of them appear only in writings of his pupils, 
> some of the results parallel or anticipate those discovered in Europe. 
> 
> For example, he is credited with the discovery of Bernoulli numbers. 
> The resultant and determinant (the first in 1683, the complete version no later than 1710) 
> are attributed to him.
>
> Seki also calculated the value of pi correct to the 10th decimal place, 
> having used what is now called the Aitken's delta-squared process, 
> rediscovered later by Alexander Aitken.
>
> Seki was influenced by Japanese mathematics books such as the Jinkōki.
