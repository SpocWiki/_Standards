> Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman (Russian: Григорий Яковлевич Перельман, 
> pronounced [ɡrʲɪˈɡorʲɪj ˈjakəvlʲɪvʲɪtɕ pʲɪrʲɪlʲˈman] ; born 13 June 1966) 
> is a Russian mathematician and geometer 
> who is known for his contributions to the fields of geometric analysis, 
> Riemannian geometry, and geometric topology. 
> 
> In 2005, Perelman resigned from his research post in Steklov Institute of Mathematics 
> and in 2006 stated that he had quit professional mathematics, 
> owing to feeling disappointed over the ethical standards in the field. 
> He lives in seclusion in Saint Petersburg and has declined requests for interviews since 2006.
>
> In the 1990s, partly in collaboration with Yuri Burago, Mikhael Gromov, and Anton Petrunin, 
> he made contributions to the study of Alexandrov spaces. 
> In 1994, he proved the soul conjecture in Riemannian geometry, 
> which had been an open problem for the previous 20 years. 
> In 2002 and 2003, he developed new techniques in the analysis of Ricci flow, 
> and proved the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture, 
> the former of which had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century. 
> The full details of Perelman's work 
> were filled in and explained by various authors over the following several years.
>
> In August 2006, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal for "his contributions to geometry 
> and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow", 
> but he declined the award, stating: "I'm not interested in money or fame; 
> I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo." 
> 
> On 22 December 2006, the scientific journal Science recognized 
> Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific "Breakthrough of the Year", 
> the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.
>
> On 18 March 2010, it was announced that he had met the criteria 
> to receive the first Clay Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. 
> On 1 July 2010, he rejected the prize of one million dollars, 
> saying that he considered the decision of the board of the Clay Institute to be unfair, 
> in that his contribution to solving the Poincaré conjecture was 
> no greater than that of Richard S. Hamilton, the mathematician who pioneered the Ricci flow 
> partly with the aim of attacking the conjecture. 
> He had previously rejected the prestigious prize of the European Mathematical Society in 1996.
