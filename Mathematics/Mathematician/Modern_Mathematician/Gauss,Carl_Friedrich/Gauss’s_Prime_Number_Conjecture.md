1792 15 year old Gauss conjectured π(x) ∼ x / ln⁡(x) ​after calculating primes up to 1 million. 
Proven by Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin (1896). 

This corresponds to the fact that the Prime Density decreases with Ln(x), which is plausible, 
because the number of possible Divisors grows.

Actually Li(x) = Int(2,x, 1/Ln(x)) approximates the Distribution much better, but from below
than x / Ln(x) which approximates it from above.
