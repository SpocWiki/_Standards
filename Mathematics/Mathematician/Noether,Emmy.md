> Amalie Emmy Noether (23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German mathematician 
> who made many important contributions to abstract algebra. 
> 
> She also proved Noether's first and second theorems, which are fundamental in mathematical physics. 
> Noether was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl, 
> and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. 
> 
> As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, 
> she developed theories of rings, fields, and algebras. 
> In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.
>
> Noether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; 
> her father was the mathematician Max Noether. 
> 
> She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, 
> but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, where her father lectured. 
> 
> After completing her doctorate in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, 
> she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. 
> At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. 
> 
> In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein 
> to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, 
> a world-renowned center of mathematical research. 
> The philosophical faculty objected, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. 
> Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.
>
> Noether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; 
> her students were sometimes called the "Noether Boys". 
> 
> In 1924, Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle 
> and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas; 
> her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. 
> 
> By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, 
> her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. 
> The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, 
> and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. 
> There, she taught graduate and post-doctoral women 
> including Marie Johanna Weiss and Olga Taussky-Todd. 
> At the same time, she lectured and performed research 
> at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
>
> Noether's mathematical work has been divided into three "epochs". 
> 
> In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential invariants in the calculus of variations, Noether's theorem, 
> has been called "one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved 
> in guiding the development of modern physics". 
> 
> In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that "changed the face of abstract algebra". 
> In her classic 1921 paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains), 
> Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide-ranging applications. 
> She made elegant use of the ascending chain condition, 
> and objects satisfying it are named Noetherian in her honor. 
> 
> In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on noncommutative algebras 
> and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups 
> with the theory of modules and ideals. 
> 
> In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas 
> and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, 
> even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology.
