> **Niels Henrik Abel** ( AH-bəl, Norwegian: [ˌnɪls ˈhɛ̀nːɾɪk ˈɑ̀ːbl̩]; 5 August 1802 – 6 April 1829) 
> was a Norwegian mathematician who made pioneering contributions in a variety of fields.  
> 
> His most famous single result is the first complete proof 
> demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals. 
> 
> This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, 
> and had been unresolved for over 250 years. 
> 
> He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions and the discoverer of Abelian functions. 
> He made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis.
>
> Most of his work was done in six or seven years of his working life. 
> Regarding Abel, the French mathematician Charles Hermite said: 
> "Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years." 
> Another French mathematician, Adrien-Marie Legendre, said: "What a head the young Norwegian has!"
>
> The Abel Prize in mathematics, originally proposed in 1899 to complement the Nobel Prizes 
> (but first awarded in 2003), is named in his honour.
