> **George Boole** Jnr (; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught 
> English mathematician, philosopher, and logician, most of whose short career 
> was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland.  
> 
> He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, 
> and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. 
> Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the Information Age 
> alongside the work of Claude Shannon.
>
> Boole was the son of a shoemaker. He received a primary school education 
> and learned Latin and modern languages through various means. 
> At 16, he began teaching to support his family. 
> He established his own school at 19 and later ran a boarding school in Lincoln. 
> Boole was an active member of local societies and collaborated with fellow mathematicians.
>
> In 1849, Boole was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork 
> (now University College Cork) in Ireland, where he met his future wife, Mary Everest. 
> He continued his involvement in social causes and maintained connections with Lincoln. 
> In 1864, Boole died due to fever-induced pleural effusion after developing pneumonia.
>
> Boole published around 50 articles and several separate publications in his lifetime. 
> Some of his key works include a paper on early invariant theory 
> and "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic," which introduced symbolic logic. 
> Boole also wrote two systematic treatises: "Treatise on Differential Equations" 
> and "Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences." 
> 
> He contributed to the theory of linear differential equations 
> and the study of the sum of residues of a rational function. 
> In 1847, Boole developed Boolean algebra, a fundamental concept in binary logic, 
> which laid the groundwork for the algebra of logic tradition 
> and forms the foundation of digital circuit design and modern computer science. 
> 
> Boole also attempted to discover a general method in probabilities, focusing on 
> determining the consequent probability of events logically connected to given probabilities. 
> 
> His work was expanded upon by various scholars, 
> such as Charles Sanders Peirce and William Stanley Jevons. 
> Boole's ideas later gained practical applications when Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov 
> employed Boolean algebra to optimize the design of electromechanical relay systems, 
> leading to the development of modern electronic digital computers. 
> University College Cork celebrated the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth in 2015, 
> highlighting his significant impact on the digital age.
>
> Boole's contributions to mathematics earned him various honors, 
> including the Royal Society's first gold prize for mathematics, the Keith Medal, 
> and honorary degrees from the Universities of Dublin and Oxford.
