## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Trigonometry** (from Ancient Greek  τρίγωνον (trígōnon) 'triangle' and  μέτρον (métron) 'measure') is a branch of mathematics concerned with relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles. In particular, the trigonometric functions relate the angles of a right triangle with ratios of its side lengths. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. The Greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in India created the earliest-known tables of values for trigonometric ratios (also called trigonometric functions) such as sine.

> Throughout history, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation.
