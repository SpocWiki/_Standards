> In the mathematical field of geometric topology, the Poincaré conjecture (French: [pwɛ̃kaʁe]) 
> is a theorem about the characterization of the 3-sphere, 
> which is the hypersphere that bounds the unit ball in four-dimensional space.
>
> Originally conjectured by Henri Poincaré in 1904, 
> the theorem concerns spaces that locally look like ordinary three-dimensional space 
> but which are finite in extent. 
> 
> Poincaré hypothesized that if such a space has the additional property 
> that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, 
> then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. 
> Attempts to resolve the conjecture drove much progress in the field of geometric topology 
> during the 20th century.
>
> The eventual proof built upon 
> Richard S. Hamilton's program of using the Ricci flow to solve the problem. 
> 
> By developing a number of new techniques and results in the theory of Ricci flow, 
> Grigori Perelman was able to modify and complete Hamilton's program. 
> In papers posted to the arXiv repository in 2002 and 2003, 
> Perelman presented his work proving the Poincaré conjecture 
> (and even the more powerful [[Geometrization_Conjecture]] of William Thurston). 
> Over the next several years, several mathematicians studied his papers 
> and produced detailed formulations of his work.
>
> Hamilton and Perelman's work on the conjecture 
> is widely recognized as a milestone of mathematical research. 
> Hamilton was recognized with the Shaw Prize in 2011 
> and the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in 2009. 
> 
> The journal Science marked Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture 
> as the scientific Breakthrough of the Year in 2006. 
> 
> The Clay Mathematics Institute, 
> having included the Poincaré conjecture in their well-known Millennium Prize Problem list, 
> offered Perelman their prize of US$1 million in 2010 for the conjecture's resolution. 
> He declined the award, saying that Hamilton's contribution had been equal to his own.
