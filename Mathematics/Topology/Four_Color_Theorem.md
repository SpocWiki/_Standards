> In mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that 
> no more than four colors are required to color the regions of any map 
> so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. 
> 
> Adjacent means that two regions share a common boundary of non-zero length 
> (i.e., not merely a corner where three or more regions meet). 
> It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. 
> Initially, this proof was not accepted by all mathematicians 
> because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand. 
> The proof has gained wide acceptance since then, although some doubts remain.
>
> The theorem is a stronger version of the five color theorem, 
> which can be shown using a significantly simpler argument. 
> Although the weaker five color theorem was proven already in the 1800s, 
> the four color theorem resisted until 1976 
> when it was proven by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in a computer-aided proof. 
> This came after many false proofs and mistaken counterexamples in the preceding decades.
>
> The Appel–Haken proof proceeds by analyzing a very large number of reducible configurations. 
> This was improved upon in 1997 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas, 
> who have managed to decrease the number of such configurations to 633 – 
> still an extremely long case analysis. 
> In 2005, the theorem was verified by Georges Gonthier using a general-purpose theorem-proving software.
