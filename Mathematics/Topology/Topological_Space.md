> In mathematics, a topological space is, roughly speaking, a geometrical space 
> in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance. 
> 
> More specifically, a topological space is a set whose elements are called points, 
> along with an additional structure called a topology, 
> which can be defined as a set of neighbourhoods for each point 
> that satisfy some axioms formalizing the concept of closeness. 
> 
> There are several equivalent definitions of a topology, 
> the most commonly used of which is the definition through open sets.
>
> A topological space is the most general type of a mathematical space 
> that allows for the definition of limits, continuity, and connectedness. 
> Common types of topological spaces include Euclidean spaces, metric spaces and manifolds.
>
> Although very general, the concept of topological spaces is fundamental, 
> and used in virtually every branch of modern mathematics. 
> 
> The study of topological spaces in their own right is called general topology (or point-set topology).
