> In mathematics, an open set is a generalization of an open interval in the real line.
>
> In a metric space (a set with a distance defined between every two points), 
> an open set is a set that, with every point P in it, 
> contains all points of the metric space that are sufficiently near to P 
> (that is, all points whose distance to P is less than some value depending on P).
>
> More generally, an open set is a member of a given collection of subsets of a given set, 
> a collection that has the property of containing every union of its members, 
> every finite intersection of its members, the empty set, and the whole set itself. 
> 
> A set in which such a collection is given is called a topological space, 
> and the collection is called a topology. 
> 
> These conditions are very loose, and allow enormous flexibility in the choice of open sets. 
> For example, every subset can be open (the discrete topology), 
> or no subset can be open except the space itself and the empty set (the indiscrete topology).
>
> In practice, however, open sets are usually chosen to provide a notion of nearness 
> that is similar to that of metric spaces, without having a notion of distance defined. 
> 
> In particular, a topology allows defining properties such as continuity, connectedness, 
> and compactness, which were originally defined by means of a distance.
>
> The most common case of a topology without any distance is given by manifolds, 
> which are topological spaces that, near each point, resemble an open set of a Euclidean space, 
> but on which no distance is defined in general. 
> 
> Less intuitive topologies are used in other branches of mathematics; 
> for example, the Zariski topology, which is fundamental in algebraic geometry and scheme theory.
