> In mathematics, Thurston's **geometrization conjecture** (now a theorem) states 
> that each of certain three-dimensional topological spaces 
> has a unique geometric structure that can be associated with it. 
> 
> It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, 
> which states that every simply connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries: 
> - Euclidean, 
> - spherical, or 
> - hyperbolic.
>
> In three dimensions, 
> it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. 
> Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold 
> can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that 
> each have one of eight types of geometric structure.  
> 
> The conjecture was proposed by William Thurston (1982) as part of his 24 questions, 
> and implies several other conjectures, such as 
> the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston's elliptization conjecture.
>
> Thurston's hyperbolization theorem 
> implies that Haken manifolds satisfy the  geometrization conjecture.  
> Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s, 
> and since then, several complete proofs have appeared in print.
>
> Grigori Perelman announced a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 
> using Ricci flow with surgery in two papers posted at the arxiv.org preprint server.  
> Perelman's papers were studied by several independent groups 
> that produced books and online manuscripts filling in the complete details of his arguments.  
> 
> Verification was essentially complete in time 
> for Perelman to be awarded the 2006 Fields Medal for his work, 
> and in 2010 the Clay Mathematics Institute awarded him its 1 million USD prize 
> for solving the Poincaré conjecture, though Perelman declined both awards.    
>
> The Poincaré conjecture and the spherical space form conjecture 
> are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, 
> although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.
