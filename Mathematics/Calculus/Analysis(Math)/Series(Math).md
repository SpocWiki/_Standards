> These finite sums are called the partial sums of the series. 
> When the limit exists, the series is convergent or summable

>  is summable, and otherwise, when the limit does not exist, the series is divergent.

> Commonly, the terms of a series come from a ring, 
> often the field ℝ of the real numbers or the field ℂ of the complex numbers.

> If so, the set of all series is also itself a ring, 
> one in which the addition consists of adding series terms together term by term
