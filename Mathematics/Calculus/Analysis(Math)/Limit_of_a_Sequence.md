> In mathematics, the limit of a sequence is the value that the terms of a sequence "tend to", 
> and is often denoted using the lim symbol e.g., lim(n→∞, a_n). 
> 
> If such a limit exists and is finite, the sequence is called convergent. 
> A sequence that does not converge is said to be divergent. 
> 
> The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion 
> on which the whole of mathematical analysis ultimately rests.
>
> Limits can be defined in any metric or topological space, 
> but are usually first encountered in the real numbers.
