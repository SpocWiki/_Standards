> Complex analysis, traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable, 
> is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers. 
> 
> It is helpful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, 
> number theory, analytic combinatorics, and applied mathematics, 
> as well as in physics, including the branches of hydrodynamics, 
> thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and twistor theory. 
> 
> By extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields 
> such as nuclear, aerospace, mechanical and electrical engineering.
>
> As a differentiable function of a complex variable 
> is equal to the sum function given by its Taylor series (that is, it is analytic), 
> complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable, 
> that is, holomorphic functions. 
>
> The concept can be extended to functions of several complex variables.
>
> Complex analysis is contrasted with real analysis, 
> which deals with the study of real numbers and functions of a real variable.
