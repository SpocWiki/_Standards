> In mathematics, the branch of real analysis studies the behavior of real numbers, 
> sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions. 
> 
> Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies are 
> convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability.
>
> Real analysis is distinguished from complex analysis, 
> which deals with the study of complex numbers and their functions.
