> Multivariable calculus (also known as multivariate calculus) 
> is the extension of calculus in one variable to functions of several variables: 
> the differentiation and integration of functions 
> involving multiple variables (multivariate), rather than just one. 
>
> Multivariable calculus is an elementary part of calculus on Euclidean space. 
> The special case of calculus in three dimensional space is often called vector calculus.
