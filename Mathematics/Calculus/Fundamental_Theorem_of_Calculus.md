> The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem 
> that links the concept of differentiating a function 
> (calculating its slopes, or rate of change at every point on its domain) 
> with the concept of integrating a function 
> (calculating the area under its graph, or the cumulative effect of small contributions). 
> 
> Roughly speaking, the two operations can be thought of as inverses of each other.
>
> The first part of the theorem, the first fundamental theorem of calculus, states 
> that for a continuous function f , an antiderivative or indefinite integral F can be obtained 
> as the integral of f over an interval with a variable upper bound.
>
> Conversely, the second part of the theorem, the second fundamental theorem of calculus, states 
> that the integral of a function f over a fixed interval 
> is equal to the change of any antiderivative F between the ends of the interval. 
> 
> This greatly simplifies the calculation of a definite integral 
> provided an antiderivative can be found by symbolic integration, thus avoiding numerical integration.
