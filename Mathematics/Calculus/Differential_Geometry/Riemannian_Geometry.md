> Riemannian geometry is the branch of differential geometry that studies Riemannian manifolds. 
> 
> An example of a Riemannian manifold is a surface, 
> on which distances are measured by the length of curves on the surface. 
> 
> Riemannian geometry is the study of surfaces and their higher-dimensional analogs 
> (called manifolds), in which distances are calculated along curves belonging to the manifold. 
> 
> Formally, Riemannian geometry is the study of smooth manifolds with a Riemannian metric 
> (an inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from point to point). 
> This gives, in particular, local notions of angle, length of curves, surface area and volume. 
> From those, some other global quantities can be derived by integrating local contributions.
>
> Riemannian geometry originated with the vision of Bernhard Riemann 
> expressed in his inaugural lecture "Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen" 
> ("On the Hypotheses on which Geometry is Based"). 
> 
> It is a very broad and abstract generalization of the differential geometry of surfaces in R3. 
> 
> Development of Riemannian geometry resulted in synthesis of diverse results 
> concerning the geometry of surfaces and the behavior of geodesics on them, 
> with techniques that can be applied to the study of differentiable manifolds of higher dimensions. 
> 
> It enabled the formulation of Einstein's general theory of relativity, 
> made profound impact on group theory and representation theory, as well as analysis, 
> and spurred the development of algebraic and differential topology.
