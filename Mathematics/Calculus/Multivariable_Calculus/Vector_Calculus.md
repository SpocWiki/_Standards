## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Vector calculus or vector analysis is a branch of mathematics 
> concerned with the differentiation and integration of vector fields, 
> primarily in three-dimensional Euclidean space R³.
>
>  The term vector calculus is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus, which spans vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration. Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations. It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and fluid flow.
>
> Vector calculus was developed from the theory of quaternions by J. Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and Edwin Bidwell Wilson in their 1901 book, Vector Analysis, though earlier mathematicians such as Isaac Newton pioneered the field. In its standard form using the cross product, vector calculus does not generalize to higher dimensions, but the alternative approach of geometric algebra, which uses the exterior product, does (see § Generalizations below for more).
