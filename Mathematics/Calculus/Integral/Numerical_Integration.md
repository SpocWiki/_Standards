> In analysis, numerical integration comprises a broad family of algorithms 
> for calculating the numerical value of a definite integral.
>
> The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) 
> is more or less a synonym for "numerical integration", 
> especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. 
> 
> Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as cubature; 
> others take "quadrature" to include higher-dimensional integration.
>
> The basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral

> to a given degree of accuracy. 
> If f(x) is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, 
> and the domain of integration is bounded, 
> there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.
>
> Numerical integration has roots in the geometrical problem 
> of finding a square with the same area as a given plane figure (quadrature or squaring), 
> as in the quadrature of the circle.
>
> The term is also sometimes used to describe the numerical solution of differential equations.
