> In mathematics (specifically multivariable calculus), 
> a multiple integral is a definite integral of a function of several real variables, 
> for instance, f(x, y) or f(x, y, z).
>
> Integrals of a function of two variables over a region in R² (the real-number plane) 
> are called double integrals, and integrals of a function of three variables over a region in 
> R³ (real-number 3D space) are called triple integrals. 
> 
> For repeated antidifferentiation of a single-variable function, 
> see the Cauchy formula for repeated integration.
