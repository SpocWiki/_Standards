## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) 
> is a differential equation (DE) dependent on only a single independent variable. 
> 
> As with any other DE, its unknown(s) consists of one (or more) function(s) 
> and involves the derivatives of those functions. 
> 
> The term "ordinary" is used in contrast with partial differential equations (PDEs) 
> which may be with respect to more than one independent variable, 
> and, less commonly, in contrast with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) 
> where the progression is random.
