> In mathematics and physics, Laplace's equation is a second-order partial differential equation 
> named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, who first studied its properties in 1786. 
> 
> This is often written as ∇² f = 0  or Δf = 0 where 
> Δ = ∇ ⋅ ∇ = ∇² is the Laplace operator, 
> ∇ ⋅ is the divergence operator (also symbolized "div"), 
> ∇ is the gradient operator (also symbolized "grad"), 
> and f(x,y,z) is a twice-differentiable real-valued function. 
> 
> The Laplace operator therefore maps a scalar function to another scalar function.
> If the right-hand side is specified as a given function, h(x,y,z) , we have Δ f = h
>
> This is called [[Poisson's_Equation]], a generalization of Laplace's equation. 
> 
> Laplace's equation and Poisson's equation are 
> the simplest examples of elliptic partial differential equations. 
> Laplace's equation is also a special case of the Helmholtz equation.
>
> The general theory of solutions to Laplace's equation is known as potential theory. 
> The twice continuously differentiable solutions of Laplace's equation are the harmonic functions, 
> which are important in multiple branches of physics, notably electrostatics, gravitation, 
> and fluid dynamics. 
> 
> In the study of heat conduction, the Laplace equation is the steady-state heat equation. 
> In general, Laplace's equation describes situations of equilibrium, 
> or those that do not depend explicitly on time.
