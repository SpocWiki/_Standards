> The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis 
> that uses variations, which are small changes in functions and functionals, 
> to find maxima and minima of functionals: 
> mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. 
> 
> Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. 
> Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found 
> using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.
>
> A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. 
> If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. 
> However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, 
> then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. 
> Such solutions are known as geodesics. 
> 
> A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: 
> light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, 
> which depends upon the material of the medium. 
> One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.
>
> Many important problems involve functions of several variables. 
> Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet's principle. 
> Plateau's problem requires finding a surface of minimal area 
> that spans a given contour in space: 
> a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. 
> 
> Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, 
> their mathematical formulation is far from simple: 
> there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, 
> and they may have non-trivial topology.
