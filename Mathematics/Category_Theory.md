> Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations 
> that was introduced by [[Samuel_Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders_Mac_Lane]] in the middle of the 20th century 
> in their foundational work on algebraic topology. 
> 
> Category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics. 
> In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones 
> that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.
>
> Many areas of computer science also rely on category theory, 
> such as functional programming and  semantics.
>
> A category is formed by two sorts of objects: 
> - the __objects__ of the category, and 
> - the __morphisms__, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. 
>   One often says that morphisms __are arrows__ that map their sources to their targets. 
> 
> __Morphisms can be composed__ if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one, 
> and morphism composition has similar properties as function composition 
> (associativity and existence of identity morphisms). 
> 
> Morphisms are often some sort of function, but this is not always the case. 
> For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, 
> whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.
>
> The second fundamental concept of category theory is the concept of a [[../../Knowledge/Math/Category_Theory.internal/Functor]], 
> which plays the role of a morphism between two categories 
>
>    it maps objects of C1 to objects of C2 
>    and morphisms of C1 to morphisms of C2 
>    in such a way that sources are mapped to sources, 
>    and targets are mapped to targets (
>    or, in the case of a contravariant functor, sources are mapped to targets and vice-versa). 
>    
>    A third fundamental concept is a natural transformation 
>    that may be viewed as a morphism of functors.
