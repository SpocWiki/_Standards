## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In physics and astronomy, a frame of reference (or reference frame) is an abstract coordinate system, 
> whose origin, orientation, and scale have been specified in physical space. 
> It is based on a set of reference points, defined as geometric points 
> whose position is identified both mathematically (with numerical coordinate values) 
> and physically (signaled by conventional markers).
>
> An important special case is that of an [[Inertial_Reference_Frame]], a stationary or uniformly moving frame.
>
> For n dimensions, n + 1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. 
> Using rectangular Cartesian coordinates, a reference frame may be defined with 
> - a reference point at the origin and 
> - a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.
>
> In [[Einsteinian_Relativity]], reference frames are used 
> to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon under observation. 
> 
> In this context, the term often becomes observational frame of reference (or observational reference frame), 
> which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its origin. 
> A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the coordinate time, 
> which does not equate across different reference frames moving relatively to each other. 
> The situation thus differs from [[Galilean_Relativity]], 
> in which all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.
