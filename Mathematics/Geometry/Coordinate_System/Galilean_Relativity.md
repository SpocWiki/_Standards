> Galilean invariance or **Galilean relativity** states that 
> the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference. 
> 
> Galileo Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his Dialogue 
> Concerning the Two Chief World Systems 
> using the example of a ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; 
> any observer below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary.
