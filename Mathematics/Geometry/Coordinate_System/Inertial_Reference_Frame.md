> In classical physics and special relativity, an inertial frame of reference 
> (also called an inertial space or a Galilean reference frame) 
> is a frame of reference in which objects exhibit inertia: 
> they remain at rest or in uniform motion relative to the frame until acted upon by external forces. 
> In such a frame, the laws of nature can be observed without the need to correct for acceleration.
>
> All frames of reference with zero acceleration are in a state of constant rectilinear motion 
> (straight-line motion) with respect to one another. 
> 
> In such a frame, an object with zero net force acting on it, is perceived to move with a constant velocity, 
> or, equivalently, Newton's first law of motion holds. 
> Such frames are known as inertial. 
> 
> Some physicists, like Isaac Newton, originally thought that one of these frames was absolute — 
> the one approximated by the fixed stars. 
> However, this is not required for the definition, 
> and it is now known that those stars are in fact moving, relative to one another.
>
> According to the principle of special relativity, 
> all physical laws look the same in all **inertial reference frame**s, 
> and no inertial frame is privileged over another. 
> 
> Measurements of objects in one inertial frame can be converted 
> to measurements in another by a simple transformation — 
> - the Galilean transformation in Newtonian physics 
> - or the Lorentz transformation (combined with a translation) in special relativity; 
> these approximately match when the relative speed of the frames is low, 
> but differ as it approaches the speed of light.
>
> By contrast, a non-inertial reference frame is accelerating. 
> In such a frame, the interactions between physical objects vary 
> depending on the acceleration of that frame with respect to an inertial frame. 
> Viewed from the perspective of classical mechanics and special relativity, 
> the usual physical forces caused by the interaction of objects 
> have to be supplemented by fictitious forces caused by inertia. 
>
> Viewed from the perspective of general relativity theory, 
> the fictitious (i.e. inertial) forces are attributed to geodesic motion in spacetime.

> Due to Earth's rotation, its surface is not an inertial frame of reference. 
> The Coriolis effect can deflect certain forms of motion as seen from Earth, 
> and the centrifugal force will reduce the effective gravity at the equator. 
> Nevertheless, for many applications the Earth is an adequate approximation of an inertial reference frame.
