> The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated physics theories by Albert Einstein: 
> special relativity and general relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively. 
> 
> Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. 
> General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. 
> It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.
>
> The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, 
> superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. 
> 
> It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, 
> relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. 
> 
> Relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, 
> along with ushering in the nuclear age. 
> 
> With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena 
> such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.
