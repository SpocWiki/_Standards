> In geometry, 
> parallel lines are coplanar infinite straight lines that do not intersect at any point. 
> 
> Parallel planes are infinite flat planes in the same three-dimensional space that never meet. 
> 
> In three-dimensional Euclidean space, a line and a plane that do not share a point 
> are also said to be parallel. 
> 
> However, two noncoplanar lines are called skew lines. 
> Line segments and Euclidean vectors are parallel 
> if they have the same or opposite direction (not necessarily the same length).
>
> Parallel lines are the subject of Euclid's parallel postulate. 
> Parallelism is primarily a property of affine geometries 
> and Euclidean geometry is a special instance of this type of geometry.
>
> In some other geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, 
> lines can have analogous properties that are referred to as parallelism.
>
> The concept can also be generalized to non-straight parallel curves 
> and non-flat parallel surfaces, 
> which keep a fixed minimum distance and do not touch each other or intersect.
