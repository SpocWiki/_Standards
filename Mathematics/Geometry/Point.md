> In geometry, a **Point** is an abstract idealization of an exact position, without size, 
> in physical space, or its generalization to other kinds of mathematical spaces. 
> 
> As zero-dimensional objects, points are usually taken to be 
> the fundamental indivisible elements comprising the space, of which one-dimensional curves, two-dimensional surfaces, and higher-dimensional objects consist. 
>
> In classical Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion, defined as "that which has no part". 
> Points and other primitive notions are not defined in terms of other concepts, 
> but only by certain formal properties, called axioms, that they must satisfy; 
> for example, "there is exactly one straight line that passes through two distinct points". 
> 
> As physical diagrams, geometric figures are made with tools such as a compass, scriber, or pen, 
> whose pointed tip can mark a small dot or prick a small hole representing a point, 
> or can be drawn across a surface to represent a curve.
>
> A point can also be determined by the intersection of two curves or three surfaces, 
> called a vertex or corner.
>
> Since the advent of analytic geometry, 
> points are often defined or represented in terms of numerical coordinates. 
> In modern mathematics, a space of points is typically treated as a set, a point set.
>
> An isolated point is an element of some subset of points 
> which has some neighborhood containing no other points of the subset.
