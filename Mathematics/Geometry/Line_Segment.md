> In geometry, a line segment is a part of a [[Straight_Line]]  
> that is bounded by two distinct endpoints (its extreme points), 
> and contains every point on the line that is between its endpoints. 
> 
> It is a special case of an arc, with zero curvature. 
> 
> The length of a line segment is given by the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. 
> A closed line segment includes both endpoints, 
> while an open line segment excludes both endpoints; 
> a half-open line segment includes exactly one of the endpoints. 
> 
> In geometry, a line segment is often denoted using an overline (vinculum) 
> above the symbols for the two endpoints, such as in AB.
>
> Examples of line segments include the sides of a triangle or square. 
> More generally, when both of the segment's end points are vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, the line segment is either an edge (of that polygon or polyhedron) if they are adjacent vertices, or a diagonal. When the end points both lie on a curve (such as a circle), a line segment is called a chord (of that curve).
