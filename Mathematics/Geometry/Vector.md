> In mathematics, physics, and engineering, 
> a **Euclidean vector** or simply a vector 
> (sometimes called a geometric vector or spatial vector) 
> is a geometric object that has 
> magnitude (or length) and direction. 
> 
> Vectors can be added to other vectors 
> according to vector algebra. 
> 
> A Euclidean vector is frequently represented 
> by a directed line segment, or graphically as an arrow 
> connecting an initial point A with a terminal point B, 
> and denoted by $\stackrel {\longrightarrow }{AB}$.
>
> A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point A to the point B; 
> the Latin word vector means "carrier". 
> 
> It was first used by 18th century astronomers 
> investigating planetary revolution around the Sun. 
> 
> The magnitude of the vector 
> is the distance between the two points, 
> and the direction refers to the direction 
> of displacement from A to B. 
> 
> Many algebraic operations on real numbers such as 
> addition, subtraction, multiplication, and negation 
> have close analogues for vectors, 
> operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of 
> commutativity, associativity, and distributivity. 
> 
> These operations and associated laws qualify Euclidean vectors 
> as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors 
> defined simply as elements of a vector space.
>
> Vectors play an important role in physics: 
> the velocity and acceleration of a moving object 
> and the forces acting on it can all be described with vectors. 
> 
> Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances 
> (except, for example, position or displacement), 
> their magnitude and direction can still be represented 
> by the length and direction of an arrow. 
> 
> The mathematical representation of a physical vector 
> depends on the coordinate system used to describe it. 
> 
> Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities 
> and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system 
> include [[Pseudo-Vector]]s and [[Tensor]]s.
