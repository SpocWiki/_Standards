The Cantor-Set is the Segment between 0 and 1 with the middle Thirds of each Interval removed. 
This corresponds to Ternary Numbers using only 0 and 2, skipping any 1 in their Digits. 

Length:: 0 = (2/3)^n 
Dimension:: ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 0.631. (Hausdorff-Dimension)
|C| = |R| also überabzählbar unendlich
