# [[Pseudo-Tensor]] 


In n-dimensional [[Geometric_Algebra]], 
pseudovectors are the 
elements of the algebra with dimension between n/2 and (n − 2): __⋀<sup>n-2</sup> Rⁿ__.

> In physics and mathematics, 
> a **Pseudotensor** is usually a quantity that transforms like a tensor 
> under an orientation-preserving coordinate transformation 
> (e.g. a proper rotation) 
> but additionally changes sign e.g. on Reflection. 
> 
> This is a generalization of a pseudovector. 
> To evaluate a tensor or pseudotensor sign, 
> it has to be contracted with some vectors, as many as its rank is, 
> belonging to the space where the rotation is made 
> while keeping the tensor coordinates unaffected 
> (differently from what one does in the case of a base change). 
> 
> Under Reflection a pseudotensor and a proper tensor of the same rank 
> will have different sign which depends on the rank being even or odd. 
> 
> Sometimes inversion of the axes is used as an example of an improper rotation 
> to see the behaviour of a pseudotensor, 
> but it works only if vector space dimensions is odd 
> otherwise inversion is a proper rotation without an additional reflection.

> There is a second meaning for pseudotensor (and likewise for pseudovector),

> Tensors obey strict transformation laws, 
> but pseudotensors in this sense are not so constrained. 
> 
> Consequently, the form of a pseudotensor will, in general, 
> change as the frame of reference is altered. 
> 
> An equation containing pseudotensors which holds in one frame 
> will not necessarily hold in a different frame. 
> 
> This makes pseudotensors of limited relevance 
> because equations in which they appear are not invariant in form.
