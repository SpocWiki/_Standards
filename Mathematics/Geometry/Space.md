> **Space** is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. 
> 
> In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. 
> Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, 
> to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. 
> 
> The concept of space is considered to be 
> of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. 
> 
> However, disagreement continues between philosophers over 
> whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.
>
> In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine 
> geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, 
> rather than flat, as in the [[Euclidean_Geometry/Euclidean_Space|Euclidean_Space]] . 
> 
> According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, 
> space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. 
> 
> Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that 
> non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.
