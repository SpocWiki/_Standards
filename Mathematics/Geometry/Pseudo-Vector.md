# [[Pseudo-Vector]] 

In n-dimensional [[Geometric_Algebra]], 
pseudovectors are the 
elements of the algebra with dimension (n − 1): __⋀<sup>n-1</sup> Rⁿ__. 

The label "pseudo-" can be further generalized 
to [[Pseudo-Scalar]]s and [[Pseudo-Tensor]]s, 
both of which **flip their sign when mirrored**, 
compared to a true [[Scalar]] or [[../Algebra/Linear_Algebra/Vector_Space/Tensor]].

> In physics and mathematics, a **Pseudovector** (or axial vector) 
> is a quantity that behaves like a vector in many situations, 
> but its direction does not conform 
> when the object is rigidly transformed by 
> rotation, translation, reflection, etc. 
> This can also happen when the orientation of the space is changed. 
> 
> For example, the angular momentum is a pseudovector, 
> because it is often described as a vector, 
> but by just changing the position of reference 
> (and changing the position vector), 
> angular momentum can reverse direction, 
> which is not supposed to happen with true vectors 
> (also known as polar vectors).
> 
> One example of a pseudovector is the normal to an oriented plane. An oriented plane can be defined by two non-parallel vectors, a and b, that span the plane. 
> The vector a × b is a normal to the plane 
> (there are two normals, one on each side – 
> the right-hand rule will determine which), and is a pseudovector. 
> This has consequences in computer graphics, 
> where it has to be considered when transforming surface normals.
>
> In three dimensions, the curl of a polar vector field at a point 
> and the cross product of two polar vectors are pseudovectors.
> 
> A number of quantities in physics behave as pseudovectors 
> rather than polar vectors, 
> including magnetic field and angular velocity. 
> 
> In mathematics, in three dimensions, 
> pseudovectors are equivalent to bivectors, 
> from which the transformation rules of pseudovectors can be derived.
