> In geometry, a prism is a polyhedron comprising an n-sided polygon base, 
> a second base which is a translated copy (rigidly moved without rotation) of the first, 
> and n other faces, necessarily all Rectangles, joining corresponding sides of the two bases. 
> All cross-sections parallel to the bases are translations of the bases. 
> 
> Prisms are named after their bases, 
> e.g. a prism with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism. 
> Prisms are a subclass of prismatoids.
>
> Like many basic geometric terms, the word prism (from Greek  πρίσμα (prisma) 'something sawed') was first used in Euclid's Elements. 
> 
> Euclid defined the term in Book XI as "a solid figure contained by two opposite, 
> equal and parallel planes, while the rest are parallelograms". 
> 
> However, this definition has been criticized for not being specific enough 
> in regard to the nature of the bases 
> (a cause of some confusion amongst generations of later geometry writers).
