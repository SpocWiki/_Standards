> In geometry, a three-dimensional space is a mathematical space in which 
> three values (termed coordinates) are required to determine the position of a point. 
> 
> Alternatively, it can be referred to as 3D space, 3-space or, rarely, tri-dimensional space. 
> 
> Most commonly, it means the three-dimensional Euclidean space, 
> that is, the Euclidean space of dimension three, which models physical space. 
> 
> More general three-dimensional spaces are called 3-manifolds. 
> The term may refer colloquially to a subset of space, 
> a three-dimensional region (or 3D domain), a solid figure.
>
> Technically, a tuple of n numbers can be understood as the Cartesian coordinates 
> of a location in a n-dimensional Euclidean space. 
> The set of these n-tuples is commonly denoted R^n
>  and can be identified to the pair formed by a n-dimensional Euclidean space 
>  and a Cartesian coordinate system.
>
> When n = 3, this space is called the three-dimensional Euclidean space 
> (or simply "Euclidean space" when the context is clear). 
> 
> In classical physics, it serves as a model of the physical universe, 
> in which all known matter exists. 
> 
> When relativity theory is considered, it can be considered a local subspace of space-time. 
> While this space remains the most compelling and useful way 
> to model the world as it is experienced, it is only one example of a 3-manifold. 
> 
> In this classical example, 
> when the three values refer to measurements in different directions (coordinates), 
> any three directions can be chosen, 
> provided that these directions do not lie in the same plane. 
> 
> Furthermore, if these directions are pairwise perpendicular, 
> the three values are often labeled by the terms width/breadth, height/depth, and length.
