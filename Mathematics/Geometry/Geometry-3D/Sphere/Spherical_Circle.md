## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In spherical geometry, a **Spherical Circle** (often shortened to circle) 
> is the locus of points on a sphere at constant spherical distance (the spherical radius) 
> from a given point on the sphere (the pole or spherical center).  
> 
> It is a curve of constant geodesic curvature relative to the sphere, 
> analogous to a line or circle in the Euclidean plane; 
> the curves analogous to straight lines are called [[Great_Circle]]s, 
> and the curves analogous to planar circles are called small circles or lesser circles. 
> 
> If the sphere is embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, its circles are the intersections of the sphere with planes, and the great circles are intersections with planes passing through the center of the sphere.
