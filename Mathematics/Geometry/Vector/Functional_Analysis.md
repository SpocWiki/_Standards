> Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, 
> the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces 
> endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (for example, inner product, norm, or topology) 
> and the linear functions defined on these spaces and suitably respecting these structures. 
> 
> The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions 
> and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform 
> as transformations defining, for example, continuous or unitary operators between function spaces. 
> This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations.
>
> The usage of the word functional as a noun goes back to the calculus of variations, 
> implying a function whose argument is a function. 
> The term was first used in Hadamard's 1910 book on that subject. 
> However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 
> by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra. 
> 
> The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, 
> in particular Fréchet and Lévy. 
> Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis 
> further developed by Riesz and the group of Polish mathematicians around Stefan Banach.
>
> In modern introductory texts on functional analysis, 
> the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, 
> in particular infinite-dimensional spaces. 
> 
> In contrast, linear algebra deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. 
> An important part of functional analysis is 
> the extension of the theories of measure, integration, and probability to infinite-dimensional spaces, 
> also known as infinite dimensional analysis.
