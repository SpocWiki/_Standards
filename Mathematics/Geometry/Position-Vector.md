> In geometry, a position 
> or position vector, also known as location vector or radius vector, 
> is a Euclidean vector that represents a point P in space. 
> 
> Its length represents the distance 
> in relation to an arbitrary reference origin O, 
> and its direction represents the angular orientation 
> with respect to given reference axes. 
> 
> Usually denoted x, r, or s, 
> it corresponds to the straight line segment from O to P.
>
> In other words, it is the displacement or translation 
> that maps the origin to P: $\mathbf {r} ={\overrightarrow {OP}}$. 
> 
> The term position vector is used mostly in the fields of 
> differential geometry, mechanics and occasionally vector calculus.
>
> Frequently this is used in two-dimensional 
> or three-dimensional space, but can be easily generalized 
> to Euclidean spaces and affine spaces of any dimension.
