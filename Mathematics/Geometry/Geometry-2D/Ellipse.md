> In mathematics, an **Ellipse** is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, 
> such that for all points on the curve, 
> the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. 
> 
> It generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity e, a number ranging from 
>  - 0 (the limiting case of a circle) to 
>  - 1 (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a parabola).
>
> An ellipse has a simple algebraic solution for its area, but for its perimeter 
> (also known as circumference), integration is required to obtain an exact solution.
>
> The largest and smallest diameters of an ellipse, also known as its width and height, 
> are typically denoted 2a and 2b. 
> An ellipse has four extreme points: 
> - two vertices at the endpoints of the major axis and 
> - two co-vertices at the endpoints of the minor axis.
>
> Analytically, the equation of a standard ellipse centered at the origin is:
> x²a² +y²b² = 1
>
> Assuming  a ≥ b, the foci are (±c, 0)  with c² = a² +b² 
> , called linear eccentricity, is the distance from the center to a focus. 
> The standard parametric equation is:  (x,y)=(a cos(t), b sin(t)) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π
>
> Ellipses are the closed type of conic section: a plane curve tracing the intersection of a cone with a plane (see figure). Ellipses have many similarities with the other two forms of conic sections, parabolas and hyperbolas, both of which are open and unbounded. An angled cross section of a right circular cylinder is also an ellipse.
>
> An ellipse may also be defined in terms of one focal point and a line outside the ellipse called the directrix: for all points on the ellipse, the ratio between the distance to the focus and the distance to the directrix is a constant, called the eccentricity:
>
> Ellipses are common in physics, astronomy and engineering. 
> For example, the orbit of each planet in the Solar System is approximately an ellipse 
> with the Sun at one focus point (more precisely, the focus is the barycenter of the Sun–planet pair). 
> The same is true for moons orbiting planets and all other systems of two astronomical bodies. 
> The shapes of planets and stars are often well described by ellipsoids. 
> A circle viewed from a side angle looks like an ellipse: 
> that is, the ellipse is the image of a circle under parallel or perspective projection. 
> The ellipse is also the simplest Lissajous figure formed 
> when the horizontal and vertical motions are sinusoids with the same frequency: 
> a similar effect leads to elliptical polarization of light in optics.
>
> The name, ἔλλειψις (élleipsis, "omission"), was given by Apollonius of Perga in his Conics.
