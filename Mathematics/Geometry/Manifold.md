> In mathematics, a **Manifold** is a topological space 
> that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. 
> 
> More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, 
> is a topological space with the property that 
> each point has a neighborhood 
> that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.
>
> One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not self-crossing curves such as a figure 8. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane.
>
> The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described in terms of well-understood topological properties of simpler spaces. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. The concept has applications in computer-graphics given the need to associate pictures with coordinates (e.g. CT scans).
>
> Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds are differentiable manifolds; their differentiable structure allows calculus to be done. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.
>
> The study of manifolds requires working knowledge of calculus and topology.
