## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In multilinear algebra, a **multivector**, sometimes called Clifford number or multor, 
> is an element of the exterior algebra Λ(V) of a vector space V. 
> 
> This algebra is graded, associative and alternating, 
> and consists of linear combinations of simple k-vectors 
> (also known as decomposable k-vectors or k-blades) of the form v_1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ v_k
> where v_1, ⋯, v_k are in V.
>
> A k-vector is such a linear combination that is homogeneous of degree k 
> (all terms are k-blades for the same k). 
> Depending on the authors, a "multivector" may be either a k-vector 
> or any element of the exterior algebra 
> (any linear combination of k-blades with potentially differing values of k).
>
> In differential geometry, a k-vector is usually a vector 
> in the exterior algebra of the tangent vector space of a smooth manifold; 
> that is, it is an antisymmetric tensor obtained 
> by taking linear combinations of the exterior product of k tangent vectors, 
> for some integer k ≥ 0. 
> 
> A differential k-form is a k-vector in the exterior algebra of the dual of the tangent space, 
> which is also the dual of the exterior algebra of the tangent space.
>
> For k = 0, 1, 2 and 3, k-vectors are often called respectively scalars, vectors, bivectors and trivectors; they are respectively dual to 0-forms, 1-forms, 2-forms and 3-forms.
