# [[Pseudo-Scalar]] 

In n-dimensional [[Geometric_Algebra]], 
Pseudo-Scalars are the 
elements of the Algebra with dimension n: __⋀ⁿ Rⁿ__.  


> In linear algebra, a **Pseudoscalar** is a quantity 
> that behaves like a scalar, 
> except that it changes sign under a parity inversion 
> while a true scalar does not.

> A pseudoscalar, when multiplied by an ordinary vector,

> a similar construction creates the pseudotensor.

> A pseudoscalar also results from any scalar product
