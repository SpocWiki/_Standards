> Mathematical induction is a method for proving that a statement P(n)
>  is true for every natural number n, that is, that the infinitely many cases 
> P(0),P(1),P(2),P(3),… 
>   all hold. 
>   
>   This is done by first proving a simple case, 
>   then also showing that if we assume the claim is true for a given case, 
>   then the next case is also true. 
>   
>   Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:
>
> Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, 
> by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis) 
> and that from each rung we can climb up to the next one (the step).
>
> A proof by induction consists of two cases. 
> The first, the base case, proves the statement for n = 0
>  without assuming any knowledge of other cases. 
>  The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case 
> n = k, then it must also hold for the next case n=k+1
>
> These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number n.
> The base case does not necessarily begin with n = 0, but often with n = 1
> , and possibly with any fixed natural number n = N 
> , establishing the truth of the statement for all natural numbers n ≥ N
>
> The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science. 
> 
> Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. 
> Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, 
> and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs.
>
> Despite its name, mathematical induction 
> differs fundamentally from **inductive reasoning** as used in philosophy, 
> in which the examination of **many cases results in a probable conclusion**. 
> 
> The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, 
> but it does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n 
> , which can take infinitely many values. The result is a rigorous proof of the statement, not an assertion of its probability.
