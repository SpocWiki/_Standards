A [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium "Nash equilibrium") is a set of strategies (one for the proposer and one for the responder in this case), 
where **no individual party can improve their reward** by changing strategy. 

If the proposer always makes an unfair offer, the responder will do best by always accepting the offer, 
and the proposer will maximize their reward. 

Although it always benefits the responder to accept even unfair offers, the responder can adopt a strategy that 
rejects unfair splits often enough to induce the proposer to always make a fair offer. 

Any change in strategy by the proposer will lower their reward. 
Any change in strategy by the responder will result in the same reward or less. 
Thus, there are two sets of Nash equilibria for this game:

- The proposer always makes an unfair offer, and the responder always accepts an unfair offer. 
  (The proposer never gives a fair offer so the responder can accept fair offers with any frequency without affecting the average reward.)
- The proposer always makes a fair offer. The responder rejects unfair offers often enough to 
  make fair offers at least as profitable as unfair offers, and always accepts fair offers.
- Marginally unfair offers may be acceptable. 


### Finite Horizon

In a non-repeated or finite-horizon ultimatum game, the first Nash equilibria (unfair offer, always accept) are the only that satisfy a stricter condition called [subgame perfection equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgame_perfect_equilibrium "Subgame perfect equilibrium") (SPE). The game can be viewed as having two subgames that repeat themselves: the subgame where the proposer makes a fair offer, and the subgame where the proposer makes an unfair offer. An SPE occurs when there are Nash Equilibria in every subgame, that players have no incentive to deviate from.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game#cite_note-2) Using [backward induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_induction "Backward induction"), we see that in the final stage, the responder will always accept any offer. Therefore, in previous stages, the proposer will always offer the minimum amount. Thus, the responder's threat to reject unfair offers in the second Nash equilibrium is not credible in a finite setting.
