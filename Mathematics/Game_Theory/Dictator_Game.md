While the ultimatum game is informative, it can be considered an over simplified model when discussing most real-world negotiation situations. Real-world games tend to involve offers and counteroffers while the ultimatum game is simply player one placing forward a division of an amount that player 2 has to accept or reject. Based on this limited scope, it is expected that the second player will accept any offer they are given, which is not necessarily seen in real world examples. 

## Application

The initial game was developed by [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman "Daniel Kahneman") in the 1980s and involved three parties, with one active and two passive participants. However, it was only in 1994 that a paper by [Forsythe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Forsythe "Robert E. Forsythe") et al. simplified this to the contemporary form of this game with one decision-maker (the dictator) and one passive participant (the recipient).
