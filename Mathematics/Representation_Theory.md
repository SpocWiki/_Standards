## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Representation theory is a branch of mathematics 
> that studies abstract algebraic structures 
> by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, 
> and studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures. 
> 
> In essence, a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete 
> by describing its elements by matrices and their algebraic operations 
> (for example, matrix addition, matrix multiplication).
>
> The algebraic objects amenable to such a description include 
> groups, associative algebras and Lie algebras. 
> 
> The most prominent of these (and historically the first) 
> is the representation theory of groups, 
> in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices 
> such that the group operation is matrix multiplication.
>
> Representation theory is a useful method 
> because it reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra, 
> a subject that is well understood. 
> 
> Representations of more abstract objects in terms of familiar linear algebra 
> can elucidate properties and simplify calculations within more abstract theories. 
> 
> For instance, representing a group by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space 
> allows methods of analysis to be applied to the theory of groups. 
> 
> Furthermore, representation theory is important in physics 
> because it can describe how the symmetry group of a physical system 
> affects the solutions of equations describing that system.
>
> Representation theory is pervasive across fields of mathematics. 
> The applications of representation theory are diverse. 
> In addition to its impact on algebra, representation theory
> - generalizes Fourier analysis via harmonic analysis,
> - is connected to geometry via invariant theory and the Erlangen program,
> - has an impact in number theory via automorphic forms and the Langlands program.
>
> There are many approaches to representation theory: 
> the same objects can be studied using methods from algebraic geometry, module theory, analytic number theory, differential geometry, operator theory, algebraic combinatorics and topology.
>
> The success of representation theory has led to numerous generalizations. 
> One of the most general is in category theory. 
> The algebraic objects to which representation theory applies 
> can be viewed as particular kinds of categories, 
> and the representations as functors from the object category 
> to the category of vector spaces. 
> 
> This description points to two natural generalizations: 
> - first, the algebraic objects can be replaced by more general categories; 
> - second, the target category of vector spaces can be replaced by other well-understood categories.
