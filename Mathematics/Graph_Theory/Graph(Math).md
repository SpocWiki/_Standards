> In discrete mathematics, particularly in **Graph** theory, 
> a graph is a structure consisting of a set of objects 
> where some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". 
> 
> The objects are represented by abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) 
> and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). 
> Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, 
> joined by lines or curves for the edges.
>
> The edges may be directed or undirected. 
> For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, 
> and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, 
> then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B 
> only if B also shakes hands with A. 
> 
> In contrast, if an edge from a person A to a person B means that 
> A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, 
> because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.
>
> Graphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. 
> The word "graph" was first used in this sense by J. J. Sylvester in 1878 
> due to a direct relation between mathematics and chemical structure 
> (what he called a chemico-graphical image).
