## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, a real number is a number that can be used 
> to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity such as a length, duration or temperature. 
> Here, continuous means that pairs of values can have arbitrarily small differences. 
> Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion.
>
> The real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and in many other branches of mathematics), 
> in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives.
>
> The set of real numbers, sometimes called "the reals", is traditionally denoted by a bold __R__, 
> often using blackboard bold ⁠ℝ 
> 
> The adjective real, used in the 17th century by René Descartes, 
> distinguishes real numbers from imaginary numbers such as i = √−1, the square root of -1.
>
> The real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. 
> The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers. 
> Some irrational numbers (as well as all the rationals) 
> are the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, such as the square root √2 = 1.414...; 
> these are called algebraic numbers. 
> There are also real numbers which are not, such as π = 3.1415...; 
> these are called transcendental numbers.
>
> Real numbers can be thought of as all points on a line called the number line or real line, 
> where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.
>
> The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient 
> for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. 
> 
> The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition 
> was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, 
> the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. 
> 
> A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) 
> Dedekind-complete ordered field. 
> 
> Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences 
> (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations. 
> 
> All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.
