> In mathematics, the word **Constant** conveys multiple meanings. 
> 
> As an adjective, it refers to non-variance (i.e. unchanging with respect to some other value); 
> as a noun, it has two different meanings: 
> 1. A fixed and well-defined number or other non-changing mathematical object, 
>    or the symbol denoting it. 
>    The terms mathematical constant or physical constant are sometimes used 
>    to distinguish this meaning.
> 2. A function whose value remains unchanged (i.e., a constant function). 
>    Such a constant is commonly represented by a variable 
>    which does not depend on the main variable(s) in question.
>
> For example, a general quadratic function is commonly written as:  ax²+bx+c
> where a, b and c are constants (coefficients or parameters), and x a variable—
> a placeholder for the argument of the function being studied. 
> 
> A more explicit way to denote this function is x ↦ a x² + b x + c,
> which makes the function-argument status of x (and by extension the constancy of a, b and c) clear. 
> 
> In this example a, b and c are coefficients of the polynomial. 
> Since c occurs in a term that does not involve x, it is called the constant term of the polynomial 
> and can be thought of as the coefficient of x0. 
> More generally, any polynomial term or expression of degree zero (no variable) is a constant.
