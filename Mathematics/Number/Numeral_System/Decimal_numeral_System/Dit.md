> The hartley (symbol Hart), also called a ban, or a dit (short for "decimal digit"), 
> is a logarithmic unit that measures [[../../../../Dimension/Information_Entropy|Information Entropy]], 
> based on base 10 logarithms and powers of 10. 
> 
> One hartley is the information content of an event 
> if the probability of that event occurring is 1⁄10. 
> It is therefore equal to the information contained in one decimal digit (or dit), 
> assuming a priori equiprobability of each possible value. 
> It is named after Ralph Hartley.
>
> If base 2 logarithms and powers of 2 are used instead, 
> then the unit of information is the shannon or bit, 
> which is the information content of an event if the probability of that event occurring is 1⁄2. 
> Natural logarithms and powers of e define the nat.
>
> One ban corresponds to ln(10) nat = log2(10) Sh, or approximately 2.303 nat, or 3.322 bit (3.322 Sh). 
> A deciban is one tenth of a ban (or about 0.332 Sh); 
> the name is formed from ban by the SI prefix deci-.
>
> Though there is no associated SI unit, 
> information entropy is part of the International System of Quantities, 
> defined by International Standard IEC 80000-13 of the International Electrotechnical Commission.
