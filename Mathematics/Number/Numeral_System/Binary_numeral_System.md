## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, 
> a method for representing numbers that uses only two symbols for the natural numbers: 
> typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). 
> 
> A binary number  may also refer to a rational number 
> that has a finite representation in the binary numeral system, 
> that is, the quotient of an integer by a power of two.
>
> The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. 
> Each digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit. 
> Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, 
> the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, 
> as a preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication, 
> because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical implementation.
