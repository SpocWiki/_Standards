> The **Decimal** numeral system (AKA base-ten positional numeral system and denary  or decanary) 
> is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. 
> It is the extension to non-integer numbers (decimal fractions) 
> of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. 
> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as decimal notation.
>
> A decimal numeral (also often just decimal or, less correctly, decimal number), 
> refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. 
> Decimals may sometimes be identified by a decimal separator 
> (usually "." or "," as in 25.9703 or 3,1415).
>
> Decimals may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, 
> such as in "3.14 is the approximation of π to two decimals".
>
> The numbers that may be represented exactly by a decimal of finite length 
> are the decimal fractions. 
> That is, fractions of the form a/10^n, where a is an integer, and n is a non-negative integer. 
> Decimal fractions also result from the addition of an integer and a fractional part; 
> the resulting sum sometimes is called a fractional number.
>
> Decimals are commonly used to approximate real numbers. 
> By increasing the number of digits after the decimal separator, 
> one can make the approximation errors as small as one wants, 
> when one has a method for computing the new digits.  
> 
> In the sciences, the number of decimal places given 
> generally gives an indication of the precision to which a quantity is known; 
> for example, if a mass is given as 1.32 milligrams, 
> it usually means there is reasonable confidence 
> that the true mass is somewhere between 1.315 milligrams and 1.325 milligrams, 
> whereas if it is given as 1.320 milligrams, then it is likely between 1.3195 and 1.3205 milligrams.  
> 
> The same holds in pure mathematics; for example, 
> if one computes the square root of 22 to two digits past the decimal point, the answer is 4.69, 
> whereas computing it to three digits, the answer is 4.690.  
> The extra 0 at the end is meaningful, 
> in spite of the fact that 4.69 and 4.690 are the same real number.
>
> 
>
> In principle, the decimal expansion of any real number 
> can be carried out as far as desired past the decimal point. 
> 
> If the expansion reaches a point where all remaining digits are zero, 
> then the remainder can be omitted, and such an expansion is called a terminating decimal. 
> A repeating decimal is an infinite decimal that, after some place, 
> repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (e.g., 5.123144144144144... = 5.123144). 
> 
> An infinite decimal represents a rational number, the quotient of two integers, if and only if 
> it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of non-zero digits.
