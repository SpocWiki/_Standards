> The unary numeral system is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers: 
> to represent a number N, a symbol representing 1 is repeated N times.
>
> In the unary system, the number 0 (zero) is represented by the empty string, 
> that is, the absence of a symbol. 
> Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... are represented in unary as 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, ...
>
> Unary is a bijective numeral system. 
> However, although it has sometimes been described as "base 1", 
> it differs in some important ways from positional notations, 
> in which the value of a digit depends on its position within a number. 
> For instance, the unary form of a number 
> can be exponentially longer than its representation in other bases.
>
> The use of tally marks in counting is an application of the unary numeral system. 
> For example, using the tally mark | (𝍷), the number 3 is represented as |||. 
> In East Asian cultures, the number 3 is represented as 三, a character drawn with three strokes. 
> (One and two are represented similarly.) 
> In China and Japan, the character 正, drawn with 5 strokes, 
> is sometimes used to represent 5 as a tally.
>
> Unary numbers should be distinguished from repunits, 
> which are also written as sequences of ones 
> but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation.
