> In mathematics, the natural numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, possibly excluding 0. 
> Natural numbers are sometimes called counting numbers or whole numbers, 
> a term that may also refer to the integers, 
> 
> The set of the natural numbers is commonly denoted with a bold __N__ or a blackboard bold ⁠ℕ. 
>
> The natural numbers are used for counting, and for labeling the result of a count, 
> like "there are seven days in a week", in which case they are called cardinal numbers. 
> 
> They are also used to label places in an ordered series, like "the third day of the month", 
> in which case they are called ordinal numbers. 
> 
> Natural numbers may also be used to label, like the jersey numbers of a sports team; 
> in this case, they have no specific mathematical properties and are called nominal numbers.
>
> Two natural operations are defined on natural numbers, addition and multiplication. 
> Arithmetic is the study of the ways to perform these operations. 
> Number theory is the study of the properties of these operations and their generalizations. 
> 
> Much of combinatorics involves counting mathematical objects, patterns and structures 
> that are defined using natural numbers.
>
> Many number systems are built from the natural numbers and contain them. 
> 
> For example, the integers are made by including 0 and negative numbers. 
> The rational numbers add fractions, and the real numbers add all infinite decimals. 
> 
> Complex numbers add the square root of −1: i = √-1.  
> 
> This makes up natural numbers as foundational for all mathematics.
