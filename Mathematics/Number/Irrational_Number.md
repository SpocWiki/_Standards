## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers that are not rational. 
> That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. 
> 
> When the ratio of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, 
> the line segments are also described as being incommensurable, 
> meaning that they share no "measure" in common, that is, there is no length 
> ("the measure"), no matter how short, that could be used 
> to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.
>
> Among irrational numbers are the ratio π of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 
> Euler's number e, the golden ratio φ, and the square root of two.  
> In fact, all square roots of natural numbers, other than of perfect squares, are irrational.
> (The Proof is analogous to 2!)
>
> Like all real numbers, irrational numbers can be expressed in positional notation, 
> notably as a decimal number. 
> In the case of irrational numbers, the decimal expansion does not terminate, 
> nor end with a repeating sequence. 
> 
> For example, the decimal representation of π starts with 3.14159, 
> but no finite number of digits can represent π exactly, nor does it repeat. 
> 
> Conversely, a decimal expansion that terminates or repeats must be a rational number. 
> These are provable properties of rational numbers and positional number systems 
> and are not used as definitions in mathematics.
>
> Irrational numbers can also be expressed as non-terminating continued fractions 
> (which in some cases are periodic), and in many other ways.
>
> As a consequence of Cantor's proof that the real numbers are uncountable 
> and the rationals countable, it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational.
