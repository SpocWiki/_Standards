> In fields such as epidemiology, social sciences, psychology  and statistics, 
> an **Observational study** draws inferences from a sample to a population 
> where the __independent variable is not under the control__ of the researcher 
> because of ethical concerns or logistical constraints. 
> 
> One common observational study is about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, 
> where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group 
> is outside the control of the investigator. 
> 
> This is in contrast with experiments, such as randomized controlled trials, 
> where each subject is randomly assigned to a treated group or a control group. 
> Observational studies, for lacking an assignment mechanism, 
> naturally present difficulties for inferential analysis.
