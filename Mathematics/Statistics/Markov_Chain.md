> In probability theory and statistics, a Markov chain or Markov process 
> is a stochastic process describing a sequence of possible events 
> in which the probability of each new event 
> depends **only on the state attained in the previous event**. 
> 
> Informally, this may be thought of as, 
> "What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now." 
> 
> A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, 
> gives a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). 
> 
> A continuous-time process is called a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). 
> Markov processes are named in honor of the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.
>
> Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes. 
> They provide the basis for general stochastic simulation methods 
> known as Markov chain Monte Carlo, 
> which are used for simulating sampling from complex probability distributions, 
> and have found application in areas including Bayesian statistics, biology, chemistry, economics, finance, information theory, physics, signal processing, and speech processing.
>
> The adjectives Markovian and Markov are used 
> to describe something that is related to a Markov process.
