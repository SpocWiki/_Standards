## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> In null-hypothesis significance testing, the **P-value** is 
> the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the result actually observed, 
> under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. 
> 
> A very small p-value means that such an extreme **observed outcome** would be very unlikely 
> under the null hypothesis. 
> 
> Even though reporting p-values of statistical tests 
> is common practice in academic publications of many quantitative fields, 
> misinterpretation and misuse of p-values is widespread 
> and has been a major topic in mathematics and metascience. 
>
> In 2016, the American Statistical Association (ASA) made a formal statement that 
> "p-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, 
> or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone" and that 
> "a p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect 
> or the importance of a result" or "evidence regarding a model or hypothesis". 
> 
> That said, a 2019 task force by ASA has issued a statement on statistical significance and replicability, concluding with: 
> "p-values and significance tests, when properly applied and interpreted, 
> increase the rigor of the conclusions drawn from data".
