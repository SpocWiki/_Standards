SE = The mean value calculated from the sample, x¯, 
will have an associated _standard error on the mean_, σx¯ , given by:

σ_x¯ = σ/√n 

A common source of confusion occurs when failing to distinguish clearly between:
- the standard deviation of the _population_ σ,
- the standard deviation of the _sample_ σ_x ,
- the standard deviation of the _sample mean_ itself σ_x¯ , which is the standard error), and
- the _estimator_ of the standard deviation of the sample mean σ^x¯, 
  which is the most often calculated quantity, and is also often colloquially called the _standard error_.

> The standard error (SE) of a statistic (usually an estimator of a parameter, 
> like the average or mean) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution. 
> The standard error is often used in calculations of  confidence intervals.
>
> The sampling distribution of a mean is generated 
> by repeated sampling from the same population and recording the sample mean per sample. 
> 
> This forms a distribution of different sample means, 
> and this distribution has its own mean and variance. 
> Mathematically, the variance of the sampling mean distribution obtained 
> is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size. 
> 
> This is because as the sample size increases, 
> sample means cluster more closely around the population mean.
>
> Therefore, the relationship between the standard error of the mean 
> and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, 
> the standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation 
> divided by the square root of the sample size. 
> 
> In other words, the standard error of the mean 
> is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean.
>
> In regression analysis, the term "standard error" refers 
> - either to the square root of the reduced chi-squared statistic 
> - or the standard error for a particular regression coefficient (as used in, say, confidence intervals).
