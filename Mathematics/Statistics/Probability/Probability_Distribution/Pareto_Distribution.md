> The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, 
> and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution 
> that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, 
> and many other types of observable phenomena; 
> 
> the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, 
> fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population.
>
> The Pareto principle or "80:20 rule" stating 
> that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, 
> but the concepts are distinct, 
> and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of   log (4/5) ≈ 1.16 reflect it. 
> 
> Empirical observation has shown that this 80:20 distribution 
> fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities.
