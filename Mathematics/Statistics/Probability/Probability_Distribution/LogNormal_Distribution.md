The logarithm of the x-Values in a LogNormal Distribution 
yields a [[Normal_Distribution]]. 

Reversely exponentiating the x-Values of a Normal Distribution yields a [[LogNormal_Distribution]]. This creates big inequalities. 
The Tail is extremely long 


LogNormal Distributions arise from Products of independent Contributions. 
When the Contributions multiply you get a

- Multiplicative fair Coin Flip Payouts multiplying by x or 1/x; 
  these have an Expectation Value of 1, because these Factors tend to cancel  
  but positive Streaks can build up very high.
