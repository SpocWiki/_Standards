> In statistics, the mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values. 
> If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x 
> at which the probability mass function P(X) takes its maximum value, i.e., x = argmaxxi P(X = xi). 
> In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.
>
> Like the statistical mean and median, the mode is a summary statistic 
> about the central tendency of a random variable or a population. 
> The numerical value of the mode is the same as that of the mean and median 
> in a normal distribution, but it may be very different in highly skewed distributions.
>
> The mode is not necessarily unique in a given discrete distribution 
> since the probability mass function may take the same maximum value at several points x1, x2, etc. 
> 
> The most extreme case occurs in **uniform distributions**, where all values occur equally frequently.
>
> A mode of a continuous probability distribution is often considered to be any value x 
> at which its probability density function has a **locally maximum** value. 
> 
> When the probability density function of a continuous distribution has multiple local maxima 
> it is common to refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution, 
> so any peak is a mode. 
> 
> Such a continuous distribution is called **multimodal** (as opposed to unimodal).
>
> In symmetric unimodal distributions, such as the normal distribution, 
> the mean (if defined), median and mode all coincide. 
> 
> For samples, if it is known that they are drawn from a symmetric unimodal distribution, 
> the sample mean can be used as an estimate of the population mode.
