> Student's t-test is a statistical test used 
> to **test whether the difference between the two means is statistically significant** or not. 
> 
> It is any statistical hypothesis test in which 
> the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. 
> 
> It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution 
> if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known 
> (typically, the scaling term is unknown and is therefore a nuisance parameter). 
> 
> When the scaling term is estimated based on the data, 
> the test statistic—under certain conditions—follows a Student's t distribution. 
> 
> The t-test's most common application is 
> to test **whether the means of two populations are significantly different**. 
> 
> In many cases, a [[Z-Test]] will yield very similar results to a t-test 
> because the latter converges to the former as the size of the dataset increases.
