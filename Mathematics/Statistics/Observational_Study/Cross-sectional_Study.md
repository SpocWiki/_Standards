> In medical research, epidemiology, social science, and biology, a cross-sectional study 
> (also known as a cross-sectional analysis, transverse study, prevalence study) 
> is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population, 
> or a representative subset, at a specific point in time—that is, cross-sectional data.
>
> In economics, **cross-sectional studies** typically involve the use of cross-sectional regression, 
> in order to sort out the existence and magnitude of causal effects of one independent variable 
> upon a dependent variable of interest at a given point in time. 
> 
> They differ from time series analysis, 
> in which the behavior of one or more economic aggregates is traced through time.
>
> In medical research, cross-sectional studies differ from case-control studies 
> in that they aim to provide data on the entire population under study, 
> whereas case-control studies typically include only individuals 
> who have developed a specific condition and compare them with a matched sample, 
> often a tiny minority, of the rest of the population. 
> 
> Cross-sectional studies are descriptive studies (neither longitudinal nor experimental). 
> Unlike case-control studies, they can be used to describe, not only the odds ratio, 
> but also absolute risks and relative risks from prevalences 
> (sometimes called prevalence risk ratio, or PRR).  
> 
> They may be used to describe some feature of the population, such as prevalence of an illness, 
> but cannot prove cause and effect . 
> 
> Longitudinal studies differ from both in making a series of 
> observations more than once on members of the study population over a period of time.
