> A longitudinal study (or longitudinal survey, or panel study) is a research design that involves 
> repeated observations of the **same variables** (e.g., people) over long periods of time 
> (i.e., uses longitudinal data). 
> 
> It is often a type of observational study, 
> although it can also be structured as longitudinal randomized experiment.
>
> Longitudinal studies are often used in 
> - social-personality and clinical psychology, 
>   to study rapid fluctuations in behaviors, thoughts, 
>   and emotions from moment to moment or day to day; 
> - in developmental psychology, to study developmental trends across the life span; 
> - and in sociology, to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations; 
> - and in consumer research and political polling to study consumer trends. 
> 
> The reason for this is that, unlike cross-sectional studies, 
> in which different individuals with the same characteristics are compared, 
> longitudinal studies track the same people, and so **the differences observed in those people** 
> **are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations**, that is, the [[cohort effect]]. 
> 
> Longitudinal studies thus make observing changes more accurate 
> and are applied in various other fields.

> In medicine, the design is used to uncover predictors of certain diseases. 
> In advertising, the design is used to identify the changes 
> that advertising has produced in the attitudes and behaviors of those within the target audience 
> who have seen the advertising campaign. 
> 
> Longitudinal studies allow social scientists to distinguish short from long-term phenomena, 
> such as poverty. 
> 
> If the poverty rate is 10% at a point in time, this may mean 
> - that 10% of the population are always poor or 
> - that the whole population experiences poverty for 10% of the time.
>
> Longitudinal studies can be retrospective (looking back in time, thus using existing data such as medical records or claims database) or prospective (requiring the collection of new data).
>
> Cohort studies are one type of longitudinal study which sample a cohort (a group of people who share a defining characteristic, typically who experienced a common event in a selected period, such as birth or graduation) and perform cross-section observations at intervals through time. Not all longitudinal studies are cohort studies; some instead include a group of people who do not share a common event.

> As opposed to observing an entire population, a panel study follows a smaller, selected group - called a 'panel'.
