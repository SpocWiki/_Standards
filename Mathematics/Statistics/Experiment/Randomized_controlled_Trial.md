> A randomized controlled trial (abbreviated RCT) is a type of scientific experiment designed to evaluate the efficacy or safety of an intervention by minimizing bias through the random allocation of participants to one or more comparison groups.  
>
> In this design, at least one group receives the intervention under study (such as a drug, surgical procedure, medical device, diet, or diagnostic test), while another group receives an alternative treatment, a placebo, or standard care.  
>
> RCTs are a fundamental methodology in modern clinical trials and are considered one of the highest-quality sources of evidence in evidence-based medicine, due to their ability to reduce selection bias and the influence of confounding factors.
>
> Participants who enroll in RCTs differ from one another in known and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be directly controlled. By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables statistical control over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted properly, and enrolls enough participants, an RCT may achieve sufficient control over these confounding factors to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.
