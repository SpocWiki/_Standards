> A **simulation** is an imitative representation of a process or system 
> that could exist in the real world. 
> 
> In this broad sense, simulation can often be used interchangeably with model. 
> Sometimes a clear distinction between the two terms is made, 
> in which simulations require the use of models; 
> the model represents the key behaviors of the selected system or process, 
> whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. 
> 
> Another way to distinguish between the terms is to define 
> simulation as experimentation with the help of a model. 
> This definition includes time-independent simulations. 
> Often, computers are used to execute the simulation.
>
> Simulation is used in many contexts, such as 
> simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, 
> safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. 
> 
> Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems 
> to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. 
> 
> Simulation can be used to show the eventual real 
> effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. 
> 
> Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, 
> because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, 
> or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.
>
> Key issues in modeling and simulation include the acquisition of 
> valid sources of information about the 
> relevant selection of key behaviors used to build the model, 
> the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the model, 
> and the fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. 
> 
> Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation 
> are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development 
> in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of computer simulation.
