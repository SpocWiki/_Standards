> A chi-squared test (also chi-square or χ2 test) is a statistical hypothesis test 
> used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large. 
> 
> In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine 
> whether two categorical variables (two dimensions of the contingency table) 
> are independent in influencing the test statistic (values within the table). 
> 
> The test is valid when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, 
> specifically Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof. 
> Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine 
> whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies 
> and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. 
> For contingency tables with smaller sample sizes, a Fisher's exact test is used instead.
>
> In the standard applications of this test, 
> the observations are classified into mutually exclusive classes. 
> If the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the classes in the population is true, the test statistic computed from the observations follows a χ2 frequency distribution. 
> The purpose of the test is to evaluate 
> how likely the observed frequencies would be assuming the null hypothesis is true.
>
> Test statistics that follow a χ2 distribution occur when the observations are independent. 
> There are also χ2 tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence 
> of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.
>
> Chi-squared tests often refers to tests 
> for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the χ2 distribution asymptotically, 
> meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic 
> approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.
