> A **Mean** is a quantity representing the "center" of a collection of numbers 
> and is intermediate to the extreme values of the set of numbers. 
> 
> There are several kinds of means (or "measures of central tendency") in mathematics, 
> especially in statistics. 
> 
> Each attempts to summarize or typify a given group of data, 
> illustrating the magnitude and sign of the data set. 
> Which of these measures is most illuminating depends on what is being measured, 
> and on context and purpose.
>
> The arithmetic mean, also known as "arithmetic average", 
> is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. 
> The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar,  $\displaystyle {\bar {x}}$
>
> If the numbers are from observing a sample of a larger group, 
> the arithmetic mean is termed the sample mean 
> to distinguish it from the group mean (or expected value) of the underlying distribution, 
> denoted Âµ or 
>
> Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used 
> in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below.
