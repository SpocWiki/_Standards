> Random variable (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable) 
> is a  mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events. 
> 
> Typically, the range of a random variable is a subset of the real numbers, 
> to allow for arithmetic Operations.
>  
> The term 'random variable' in its mathematical definition refers to neither randomness nor variability 
> but instead is a mathematical function in which 
> the domain is the set of possible outcomes in a sample space (e.g. the set {H,T}
> which are the possible upper sides of a flipped coin heads H or tails T as the result from tossing a coin); 
> and the range is a measurable space (e.g. corresponding to the domain above, 
> the range might be the set {-1,1} if say heads H mapped to -1 and T mapped to 1). 
>
> Informally, randomness typically represents some fundamental element of chance, 
> such as in the roll of a die; it may also represent uncertainty, such as measurement error. 
> However, the interpretation of probability is philosophically complicated, 
> and even in specific cases is not always straightforward. 
> 
> The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is independent of such interpretational difficulties, 
> and can be based upon a rigorous axiomatic setup.
>
> In the formal mathematical language of measure theory, 
> a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space 
> (called the sample space) to a measurable space. 
> 
> This allows consideration of the pushforward measure, 
> which is called the distribution of the random variable; 
> the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible values of the random variable. 
> It is possible for two random variables to have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; 
> for instance, they may be independent.
>
> It is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and continuous random variables, 
> corresponding to whether a random variable is valued in a countable subset 
> or in an interval of real numbers. 
> 
> There are other important possibilities, especially in the theory of stochastic processes, 
> wherein it is natural to consider random sequences or random functions. 
> Sometimes a random variable is taken to be automatically valued in the real numbers, 
> with more general random quantities instead being called random elements.
>
> According to George Mackey, 
> Pafnuty Chebyshev was the first person "to think systematically in terms of random variables".
