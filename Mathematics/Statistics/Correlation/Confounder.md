> In causal inference, a **confounder** is a variable 
> that influences **both the dependent variable and independent variable**, 
> causing a spurious association.  
> 
> Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, 
> cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations. 
> 
> The existence of confounders is an important quantitative explanation 
> why correlation does not imply causation. 
> 
> Some notations are explicitly designed to identify the existence, possible existence, 
> or non-existence of confounders in causal relationships between elements of a system.
>
> Confounders are threats to internal validity.
