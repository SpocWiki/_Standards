> In mathematics, an **Isomorphism** is a structure-preserving mapping or morphism 
> between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. 
> 
> Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. 
> The word is derived from Ancient Greek  ἴσος (isos) 'equal' and  μορφή (morphe) 'form, shape'.
>
> The interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that 
> two isomorphic objects have the same properties 
> (excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects). 
> 
> Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only, 
> and may often be identified. 
> 
> In mathematical jargon, one says that two objects are the same up to an isomorphism. 
> A common example where isomorphic structures cannot be identified is 
> when the structures are substructures of a larger one. 
> For example, 
> all subspaces of dimension one of a vector space are isomorphic and cannot be identified.
>
> An automorphism is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a canonical isomorphism  (a canonical map that is an isomorphism) if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures (as is the case for solutions of a universal property), or if the isomorphism is much more natural (in some sense) than other isomorphisms. For example, for every prime number p, all fields with p elements are canonically isomorphic, with a unique isomorphism. The isomorphism theorems provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique.
>
> The term isomorphism is mainly used for algebraic structures and categories. In the case of algebraic structures, mappings are called homomorphisms, and a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective. 
>
> In various areas of mathematics, isomorphisms have received specialized names, depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example:
>
> 
>
> An isometry is an isomorphism of metric spaces.
>
> A homeomorphism is an isomorphism of topological spaces.
>
> A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of spaces equipped with a differential structure, typically differentiable manifolds.
>
> A symplectomorphism is an isomorphism of symplectic manifolds.
>
> A permutation is an automorphism of a set.
>
> In geometry, isomorphisms and automorphisms are often called transformations, for example rigid transformations, affine transformations, projective transformations.
>
> Category theory, which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures, provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea.
