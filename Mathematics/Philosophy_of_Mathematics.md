> Philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy 
> that deals with the nature of mathematics 
> and its relationship to other areas of philosophy, 
> particularly epistemology and metaphysics. 
> 
> Central questions posed include

> or are in some way concrete, and 
> in what the relationship such objects have with physical reality consists.
>
